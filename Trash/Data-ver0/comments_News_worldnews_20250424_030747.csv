worldnews,1joakvh,mkr11ad,"Couple facts about Iran's missile capabilities as it relates to striking Diego Garcia:

First, Diego Garcia is about 3900km away from the closest part of Iran. It is more like 4000+km away from any suspected underground missile silos or above-ground launch sites that can accommodate a missile with enough range to make it that far.

Second, according to Iran, the only missiles it has with 4000+km range are satellite launch vehicles, and not weapons. Now, that is likely a lie and they can probably mount a military payload onto one of those missiles, but the only way Iran can strike at Diego Garcia is by using missiles that they have said were only developed for peaceful purposes. All of their officially military missiles lack the range to hit it.

Third, the three satellite launching missiles that might have the range to put a warhead on Diego Garcia if used as weapons are the Simorgh, Zuljanah, and maybe the Ghaem-100. That last one probably doesn't have the range to make it reliably, but I will give it the benefit of the doubt and include it. Of those three missiles, only the Simorgh and Ghaem-100 are considered operational by Iran. The Zuljanah is still considered to be in testing. The Simorgh currently has around a 40% failure rate in the 8 actual flights that have been attempted. Also, it really only launches from a single above-ground site. If Iran were going to use one as a ballistic missile, they could likely only fire one at a time and it would take days or weeks to assemble another. The Ghaem-100 has only had four test launches and one of those failed so it currently has a 25% failure rate. Also, 4000km is estimated to be the very top end of its range, which means any small problems could leave a payload short of its intended target. Iran has claimed to be working on more powerful versions, but has yet to actually fly any. The Zuljanah has had two test flights so far, but both were sub-orbital, and as such haven't demonstrated the actual performance needed to be used as a ballistic missile that could reach Diego Garcia.

Basically, the vast majority of Iran's missiles have nowhere near the range needed to reach Diego Garcia, and the ones that potentially could are either not reliable, haven't shown the ability to actually reach their on-paper ranges, or can't be fired en mass. It doesn't really matter much if Iran wants to strike Diego Garcia or not. Realistically, they don't have the weapons to do it.",1003,2025-03-31 20:56:22,BlueMaxx9

worldnews,1k5i97p,mojyoaw,"I worked as a Deputy Returning Officer at a polling station in Maple Ridge B.C. a relatively small ( 100, 000 ) suburb of Vancouver. Last general election in '21, roughly 14,000 votes were cast over the entire 4 days. This time, 7000 were cast just in the first two days.

I said to more than a few voters in quick passing conversations as I issued/ received their precious ballot that it was immediately apparent to us that, regardless of which way one leans politically, Canadians are ENERGIZED for this election, likely to be the most momentous in our history.

Given the record turnout over this weekend and what I suspect will continue on Monday....be prepared to wait awhile to learn the results. The votes, starting at 7pm local time are hand counted, one by one as they are removed one by one, examined and scrutinized by both the Elections Canada employee like myself who issued it as well as authorized officials from the individual candidates. 

My advice to my fellow Canadians is to Buckle Up and continue to be patient as we await the results of the final count. The process of the vote and the count is long, but necessary. 

To all who I interacted with over the last few days, and everyone else across our beautiful land, thank you for your patience, kindness and warmth. It was a pleasure ( believe it or not ) to be of service over the course of the last 4 days ( ~ 14+ hours each day lol ).

>__The Geneva-based World Health Organization (WHO) has proposed cutting its budget by a fifth. This comes after its largest contributor, the US, decided to withdraw. The organisation must now reduce its tasks and staff, it said.__

>The WHO is facing a funding gap of almost $600 million (CHF530 million) in 2025 and has “no choice” but to start making cuts, the institution’s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said in an internal email obtained by the French news agency AFP. The letter was sent to employees of the UN health agency on Friday.

>After moving into the White House in January, US President Donald Trump decided to freeze almost all US foreign aid, including for important programmes to improve health around the world.

>Trump justified his decision to withdraw his country from the WHO in January with the discrepancy between the financial contributions of the US and China and accused the organisation of “ripping off” his country.

>The US was by far the largest contributor to the WHO’s budget: in the last two-year budget cycle for 2022 to 2023, it contributed 16.3% of the organisation’s total budget of $7.89 billion. The majority of US funding came from voluntary contributions for specific projects and not from a fixed contribution.

>Spain's Minister of Economy, Carlos Cuerpo, introduced the proposal for such a temporary tool to fund large-scale, pan-European projects. He called on his EU colleagues to join the initiative.

>""This is the time for European solidarity to support Ukraine and Eastern frontline countries. We need to invest together in defense, which is a genuinely European public good that benefits our citizens and bolsters our economic security,"" Cuerpo said on the sidelines of a meeting in Warsaw.

>Bloomberg explains that some countries in the bloc face a lack of funding. This means the EU needs to find additional financing options for the long-standing underfunding, and one of the topics discussed was the creation of new pan-European tools.

>Unlike the proposed options based solely on concessional loans, Spain wants to provide EU countries with grants, particularly those in the East, which are more vulnerable to the Russian threat.

>The proposed Spanish instrument, designed as a targeted mechanism, would be funded through contributions from member states, joint EU debt, and the European Stability Mechanism's rescue fund.

>Additionally, Madrid has stated that part of the Russian Central Bank's frozen assets in Europe, totaling €200 billion ($227 billion), could also be used to finance military projects benefiting Ukraine.

>EU Economic Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis told reporters after the meeting that the Commission is ""ready to explore new ways and options."" He added that Spain's focus on supporting the eastern region ""fits well in the discussion we are having.""

>Speaking alongside the Commissioner, Polish Finance Minister Andrzej Domański, who chaired the meeting, said that the overwhelming majority of ministers believe additional defense funding tools may be necessary. He also called the solidarity shown by some southern EU members ""encouraging.""

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said foreign “propaganda” would be banned after US anti-migrant ads ran on national TV.

The commercials showed US Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem warning that anyone crossing the US-Mexico border illegally would be prosecuted and deported.

Washington’s tough measures have pushed illegal crossings to their lowest level since the 1960s, while Mexican troops — deployed in response to pressure from the White House — have prevented many from reaching the border in the first place.

>In addition to these CHF7.4 billion, 14 real estate assets of individuals, companies or entities targeted by the European Union’s sanctions against Russia have been taken over by Switzerland.

>The year-on-year increase is due to the fact that additional assets were identified and subsequently frozen, SECO said in a press release.

>As announced in August 2024, following a preliminary investigation by SECO, the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland opened criminal proceedings on suspicion of violating the sanctions.

Air Canada did look into Starlink but aero version of starlink requires a fairly major overhaul. There’s two NEW holes they need to cut into the fuselage for the starlink antennas and a major set of STCs that need to go on for this.

I think for AC, the Intelsat/OW solution is a better fit. They are similar bent-pipe systems  that follow the ARINC792 standard and retrofits onto current solutions AC already used including the line fit  Thinkom antennas under the line fit tri-band radome. The MODMAN is likely the primary piece of equipment that required modification. They either added an additional channel card (if possible) or have one that can support both types of waveforms.

In this case, most Chinese cars are heavily subsidized by the Chinese government, allowing cars to be sold at or below cost, and as European car manufacturers can’t compete with that, China would eventually conquer the market with cheap cars, putting European manufacturers out of business, so you slap a tariff on Chinese cars to make your own products competitive, thus protecting your local industry, and steering consumers towards alternative products.

I probably didn't say enough, so expanding on my comment with an edit.

The biggest problem is that Trump's approach to everything elicits a much stronger response because he's meant to be a good negotiator, according to his fanbase, but a good negotiation I've always been told results is a mutual beneficial result win/win; however Trump has proven time and time again that there's always a catch to his negotiations and the other party ends up losing.

Ukraine peace deal: He's only supposed to be brokering a peace deal but he wants to own their power and minerals etc, and indenture them - it's win/lose since it's either have assets stripped by Trump or lose land and eventually territorial takeover by Putin.
Europe had offered Trump 0/0 tariffs before on industrial products but he didn't accept. Interestingly his little attack dog Musk had advocated zero tariffs between USA and EU but Trump doesn't want that afterall. He wants Britain to take chlorinated chicken, steroid beef and basically do what Trump says on internal politics that don't have anything do with him. If we don't accept his poisoned chalice he'll increase tariffs. He's probably made similar demands on other countries (France..Marine le Pen (keep your damp nose out of French politics).
He's insisting that the EU buy US energy worth 350bn and take weapons orders even though he's suggested they'll build a kill-switch into F35s to demobilise them and has said he wants nothing more to do with NATO and that Europe should fight their own battles.
Then there's the Greenland and Canada threats, and his lack of concern that invading Greenland should invoke Article 5, and if it wasn't it would be the biggest betrayal of a NATO member state and also prove that NATO is not committed to protecting its members...cue Putin to then test the system with Baltic states.

I get that everyone is saying ""not the bazooka"" and I understand why, since once started it will be the PONR, but certain people in Europe have said themselves that the old world order is ending. Unfortunately, it's not just Putin or Kim Jong Un anymore, it's Trump also since he is equally as greedy and dare I say he is the new threat, and he mustn't be allowed to get his way, or interfere in European politics when he is telling everyone else ""America is our country and we don't care what you think"".

It's turning into an existential crisis and Trump doesn't care as long as he's not losing. His duplicitous nature makes him untrustworthy and there will have to be eyes on him always while he is President. And already I'm tired of him and reading about him, and the news being dominated by him.

And then you have articles like this, that I hope is just satire

They've established a new leadership that's totally rudderless at present and actively hurting the US position on the planet. 

My conspiracy isn't that Trump and Russia are in cahoots, it's that Russia has got what they want out of him and now they're ready to bring the new administration of jokers to a real world situation.  In a way they've set up their own enemy. 

The US will be in dissaray in so many key strategic points and many US allies are even thinking China are a better way to go or at least not aligning fully with the US and that really ends the bloc that Russia faced as an enemy.",99,2025-04-14 11:28:27,VladTheInhalerOf

worldnews,1k1ovsb,mnoci2o,"Rare earth elements aren't rare, and AFAIK the ""reserves"" of ores supposedly in Ukraine date back to (probably flawed) surveys conducted in Soviet times.

Refining and separating rare earth elements is a potential environmental nightmare, most ores also contain thorium, which needs to be separated and safely disposed of - as it's radioactive and definitely a cause of cancer if inhaled.

While the world was happy to buy Chinese refined rare earths for a couple of decades, when the Chinese started tightening up on domestic environmental and OSH regs and the prices increased accordingly, this still didn't result in investment in refining in the west.  That happened more than a decade ago.  Probable reason - nobody wants to deal with the cost of treating chemical waste, and the need to safely separate and dump radioactive waste is a final deal-breaker. 

If the deal with Ukraine involves refining and separation, then it's probably because the US wants access to the product - but doesn't want the dirty shit on US soil.  Same probably with their insane plans to annex Greenland - ""one way or another"".

worldnews,1jvxdn2,mml9cuc,"From the article:

My comment - this is very interesting that targeting ""ammunition stockpiles"" is the main driving force.  Really impressive!  Now the article text:


""Long-range Ukrainian strikes on ammunition stockpiles in Russia brought down Moscow's artillery shell fire rate by almost half, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said in an interview with Ukrainian media outlet Lb. ua published on April 9.

Throughout 2024, Ukraine has carried out multiple drone strikes, targeting Russian ammunition depots inside Russia and in the Ukrainian occupied territories.

According to Syrskyi, Russian soldiers used to fire around 40,000 rounds of ammunition daily across, but a series of long-range attacks reduced this number to around 23,000.

""We continue to expand in this direction, increasing the number, scale and capabilities of deep strike (long-range operations) and have already passed the 1,700 kilometers mark. Our teams are also increasing the unmanned component,"" said Syrskyi.

Since then, Russia's fire rate has risen slightly, now sitting at between 27,000 and 28,000 rounds per day, the general said.

The general attributed this to possible supplies of shells from Moscow allies, North Korea or Iran, or to increased Russian production.

Ammunition shortages have plagued Ukraine over the course of Russia's full-scale invasion. The EU failed to deliver on its promise to produce 1 million artillery shells between March 2023 and 2024 while political disputes in Washington led to a severe delay in a $61 billion aid package.

In late December, Sky News reported, citing unnamed Western officials, that Russia's artillery advantage against Ukraine dropped to 1.5 rounds for each Ukrainian shell. """,1,2025-04-11 16:47:07,hcpookie

worldnews,1jnftwx,mkl2ye2,">**Polish authorities have joined the search for Anzhalika Melnikaŭa, a Belarusian opposition leader in exile who disappeared along with her two daughters, according to Interior Ministry spokesperson Jacek Dobrzyński.**

>Melnikaŭa left Belarus after two attempts to arrest her following the mass protests in 2020 and worked alongside opposition figure Pavel Latushka in the National Anti-Crisis Management. She later became the head of the Belarusian Coordination Council, an organization formed during the civil unrest by opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya.

>There has been no contact with Melnikaŭa or her two daughters, aged 6 and 12, who had been living with her in Warsaw.

>On March 25, Polish authorities were notified of their disappearance by Latushka, and the Belarusian Human Rights Center ""Viasna"" officially confirmed the news.

>Due to law enforcement requests, this information was not made public earlier.

>**Polish authorities join efforts to locate Melnikaŭa**

>The first official statement on the matter was made on Saturday morning by Jacek Dobrzyński, spokesperson for the Ministry of the Interior and Administration and Minister-Coordinator of Special Services.

>Dobrzyński confirmed that Melnikaŭa had been outside Poland for several weeks, adding that ""Polish authorities will assist other countries' services and the Belarusian Coordination Council in efforts to determine her whereabouts.""

>According to the Belarusian Coordination Council, opposition figures remain targets of the special services of the regimes in Minsk and Moscow. There are suspicions that Melnikaŭa may be outside Poland, and possibly even outside the European Union.

This would give the side deploying the nuclear device a major first strike advantage.

The importance of the treaty between the US and the USSR preventing the deployment of nuclear weapons to space is that it allows both countries to essentially launch satellites into space with minimal interference from the other.  If there's reason to believe that Russia is willing to violate the treaty and deploy a nuclear weapon to space, then it would be imperative for the US to basically see to it that all Russian rockets where the payloads are not able to be fully investigated are intercepted before they reach low earth orbit.",372,2025-04-12 14:49:15,Crede777

worldnews,1jxi1i8,mmqpzr0,"Ok, so here's the thing. A nuclear device in space serves one primary purpose that is talked around every single time in these articles. Yes, a detonation in orbit would disable satellites. However, it'd also destroy pretty much all electronics on the ground within line of sight (with a few variables.) It's called an H-EMP (High Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse.) That's what these articles don't want to focus on, intentionally or not.

It's known as an asymmetric weapon- because it can level the military playing field from one nation to another. North Korea could, theoretically, remove the U.S as a world power with but a few nukes in orbit (hidden on satellites), despite the U.S having incomparable military might. Hence, an asymmetric weapon. This applies to Russia as well. The nuke doesn't have to be a missile- but can be hidden aboard an otherwise-innocuous satellite.

There was a Commission appointed in the U.S to study the phenomenon (I've had the pleasure of conversing with the late leader of said commission, Dr. Pry.) In short, a successful EMP attack (on the U.S.) would lead to about 90% dead within a year due to lack of utilities, starvation, etc. Burst it over a nation, and you've disabled pretty much their entire society- infrastructure, food production, power grid, communications, water treatment, etc. All without hitting their nation conventionally. Couple it with a cyber attack, and that would make the effect even more devastating.

None of these articles are discussing that being the primary purpose, but that's the threat of these devices. Money is being shunted to harden military components against an HEMP, and in 2015, NORAD communications were moved back into Cheyenne Mountain to shield against an EMP.

When in doubt, follow the money.

This news should make people who understand what an EMP attack is at the very least, rather unsettled. Every since news broke a few years ago, there haven't been reports walking back that Russia is pursuing this. People (and governments,) should prepare accordingly.

Personally, I really, really don't like it. Disaster Preparedness is my career & education, and I've learned little to nothing that pokes holes in the 90% death figure. All I can do is try and mitigate the potential impact to myself and friends/family as best I can.

worldnews,1k3hrqm,mo26jze,"**From The Telegraph's Chief Political Correspondent, Nick Nutteridge:**

RAF fighter jets were scrambled twice in less than 48 hours to defend Nato airspace from Russian warplanes, The Telegraph can reveal.

[British Typhoons](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/04/08/fighter-jets-uk-f35-typhoon-tempest-5th-6th-gen-tech/) were called into action on two separate occasions this week after Kremlin aircraft flew too close to Nato’s border, sparking an alert.

The interventions came as Donald Trump appeared to lose patience with Vladimir Putin and threatened to pull out of talks on a [Ukraine peace deal](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/russia-ukraine-war/).

They will be used by No 10 as further evidence of the [growing Russian threat](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2025/04/01/putin-wont-be-laughing-for-much-longer/) as it tries to persuade the US not to scale back its presence in Europe.

It is the first time that the RAF has been called into action under Operation Chessman, a new Nato mission to bolster Europe’s air defences.

Ministers said that the [latest stand-off in the skies](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/01/15/nato-jets-scrambled-russia-attacks-ukraine-infrastructure/) showed how Russia was growing increasingly aggressive in its testing of the Western military alliance.

On Tuesday, two Typhoons stationed at Malbork air base in Poland were scrambled to intercept a Russian spy plane over the Baltic Sea.

Less than 48 hours later, another pair were sent up to deter an unknown aircraft leaving the exclave of Kaliningrad, between Poland and Lithuania.

Luke Pollard, the Armed Forces minister, told The Telegraph: “The UK is unshakeable in its commitment to Nato.

“With Russian aggression growing and security threats on the rise, we are stepping up to reassure our allies, deter adversaries and protect our national security through our plan for change.

“This mission shows our ability to operate side by side with Nato’s newest member Sweden and to defend the alliance’s airspace wherever and whenever needed, keeping us safe at home and strong abroad.”

The planes, part of a six-strong fleet, were only posted to Poland three weeks ago as part of a joint defence operation with the Swedish air force.

They are usually stationed at RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland and have been accompanied on the mission by almost 200 British military personnel.

When the planes were deployed, Wg Cdr Christopher Jacob said that they would “defend and deter, standing ready to protect against any threat”.

1. Canada renegotiates USMCA ideally with freedom of movement of workers between Canada and the US and Canada and Mexico.

2. Canada forms CANZUK, with Britain, New Zealand, and Australia. Nearly 0 tariffs and freedom of movement.

3. Canada joins the EU while keeping the option to retain the Canadian dollar like Denmark keeping the right to use the krone.

4. While this happens, the Canadian federal government grinds whatever grist the mill requires to build the Northern Gateway and Energy East pipelines and build more than 100,000 housing units per year.  Even if it means expropriation, the War Measures Act, and a draft.  Build refineries and plastics in AB and SMR nuclear reactors elsewhere like QC.  Consider obtaining nuclear armed subs from France until we can roll our own.  Move farther from export of raw materials and towards finished value added goods.

5. Defence spending goes to 3% with a path to 5% with a heavy emphasis on the arctic, Canadian, and European gear.

6. Canada becomes a transshipment hub, with tweaks to USMCA if the US gets too butthurt.

7. Pay back the debt, eliminate deficits.  Open trading corridors in Asia.

Furthermore, it appears to be that this isn’t a “go to school here instead of the US” type of deal. I have a feeling this is what some people might get hung up on if they read the headline and then come to leave a comment. They are looking for people who already have degrees.  
  
**Target audience:**  
* Researcher position  
* Phd or mba in any discipline  
* 2 years experience since phd  
* Based on USA for at least 2 years as of date submitting the application  
* 67yo or younger  
* All nationalities welcome

Anyone who has experience with French academia knows how deeply underfunded universities are. 

As well, one thing that made U.S. universities so attractive to researchers, aside from the salaries, is the funding and possibilities. Universities in America are so tied to industry and the government that your research may have limits, but it could go somewhere - it wasn't a dead end. 

Unfortunately for France, the funds are so much more limited, and the potential/possibilities are much more narrow than the U.S. and its juggernaut system.",17,2025-04-18 00:14:31,Odd_Responsibility_5

worldnews,1k4rwzv,mocbgd5,"Snippet from this news article:”On April 19, the Ukrainian Air Force conducted a precision strike on a Russian drone operations facility near the village of Tyotkino in Russia’s Kursk region, according to a statement from Ukraine’s General Staff.

The targeted site was reportedly used by Russian forces to prepare, equip, and launch reconnaissance, attack, and FPV drones against Ukrainian territory. The General Staff said up to 20 drone operators were eliminated in the strike.

According to the statement, the facility served as a hub for launching unmanned aerial attacks, making it a significant part of Russia’s drone warfare infrastructure.

Ukraine’s military leadership stated the Armed Forces will continue targeting Russian military infrastructure involved in operations against Ukraine.

Earlier, on April 20, Ukrainian forces shot down a rare Russian “Forpost” reconnaissance and strike drone — a domestically produced version of Israel’s IAI Searcher Mk II — at an altitude of 4 kilometers.

The $7 million UAV, capable of carrying laser-guided KAB-20 bombs, was reportedly hit by an FPV drone operated by Ukraine’s 414th Separate UAV Brigade. After sustaining damage to its control surfaces, the drone glided across the border and likely crashed in Russia’s Kursk region.

On the night of March 31, a drone strike targeted Russia’s Shaikovka airbase, home to Tu-22M3 bombers involved in missile strikes on Ukraine. Satellite images published by the Ukrainian OSINT group CyberBoroshno later confirmed the destruction of a technical building and storage facilities used for servicing and fueling Kh-22 and Kh-32 missiles.",104,2025-04-21 23:28:20,AndroidOne1

>The doctors are part of a group, the Polish Association of Independent Physicians and Scientists (PSNLiN), that actively opposes the use of vaccines.

>“They signed a letter which falsely presented both the results of research on vaccines and the entire strategy to combat the pandemic,” Paweł Wróblewski, president of the Lower Silesian Medical Chamber, which is overseeing the case, told broadcaster TVN.

>“The doctors are accused of promoting anti-health attitudes and publicly disseminating information that is inconsistent with current medical knowledge, thereby acting to the detriment of patients and the entire society,” he added.

>The trial of the 45 accused doctors began on Wednesday at the district medical court in the city of Wrocław. Further proceedings against other doctors accused of the same offences are also taking place in Gdańsk and Poznań. Around 100 doctors in total are facing action.

>During yesterday’s hearing in Wrocław, anti-vaccine activists protested in defence of the doctors. Among them was Grzegorz Braun, a prominent radical-right politician, conspiracy theorist and currently a presidential election candidate.

>In 2021, Braun was part of a group of far-right MPs who attended a protest against Covid vaccinations and restrictions and stood beneath a banner saying “Vaccination sets you free” modelled on the sign at Auschwitz and other Nazi German camps saying “Arbeit macht frei” (“Work sets you free”).

>Earlier this year, the mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski, filed a motion in court to dissolve PSNLiN, which is registered in his city.

>He did so in response to a request from the state Commissioner for Patient Rights, who argued that the association was acting to the detriment of public health by, among other things, questioning the safety of mandatory vaccines for children.

>PSNLiN’s website, for example, claims that children are six times more likely to die after receiving a Covid-19 vaccine. The website also promotes a campaign by STOP NOP, a leading anti-vaccine group, offering advice on “how to defend yourself against forced vaccination of children”.

>OKO.press, an investigative news and fact-checking website, notes that PSNLiN members have been involved in spreading conspiracy theories that the Covid pandemic was part of a secret global plan aiming to bring about depopulation.

>During the pandemic, a number of large protests against Covid vaccines and pandemic restrictions took place in Poland. International polling suggested that Poles were among the most reluctant to take the Covid vaccine and the country’s vaccination rate lagged well behind the EU average.

>In 2022, a Polish doctor who spread claims that Covid was a “fake pandemic” was stripped of her medical license for a year by a medical court. In the same year, the chairwoman of PSNLiN, Dorota Sienkiewicz, also had her license suspended for a year for spreading anti-vaccine claims.

>More broadly, Poland has, like other countries, experienced a growth in anti-vaccine sentiment in recent years, leading to a dramatic increase in the number of parents refusing to give their children compulsory vaccinations.",20,2025-04-18 07:07:58,BubsyFanboy

worldnews,1jxw45e,mmtp9ia,"Snippet from this news article:”Ukraine has become the world’s top producer of FPV drones, manufacturing more than 2.2 million units and rapidly expanding its defense industrial base to meet the demands of modern warfare, leading defense officials said during the Ukrainian Weapons 2024 forum in Kyiv, which UNITED24 Media correspondent attended on April 11.
“I won’t repeat what my colleague already said about how this growth was achieved,” said Maksym Vasylenko, board member of the Ukrainian Arms Council, head of the NRC Association, and co-founder and CEO of Tencore LLC, a company that develops drones for Ukraine’s armed forces.
“But it’s no secret that we are now the number one country in the world for FPV drone production. We’ve produced over 2.2 million drones, and we’ve already begun working with $35 billion in investments and contracts. That’s the goal we must continue to pursue.”

Vasylenko noted that Ukraine’s production drive goes beyond drones.
“We’ve ramped up manufacturing of missiles, electronic warfare systems (EW and REW), and ground robotic platforms. More than 50% of the materials used in these systems are now sourced locally,” he added.
“In addition, there’s already a company that has built drones using 100% domestically produced components.”
This shift to localization marks a critical milestone for Ukraine’s defense industry. In addition to ensuring faster delivery and supply chain security, it signals Ukraine’s strategic aim to become self-reliant in defense manufacturing amid Russia’s full-scale invasion.
Earlier, European countries pledged over €21 billion ($24 billion) in military aid to Ukraine during a meeting of Western backers in Brussels, underscoring continued efforts to help the country counter Russia’s ongoing invasion.",34,2025-04-13 01:04:58,AndroidOne1

worldnews,1k57t6i,mogiprf,">Czechia is now completely independent of Russian oil, Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala and other officials announced on April 17, marking the first time in history no Russian pipeline oil flows to the country.

>Prague is receiving no supplies through Russia's Druzhba oil pipeline for the first time in over 60 years, securing alternative supplies thanks to the expansion of the western Transalpine Pipeline (TAL), running through Italy, Austria, and Germany.

>The move underscores Europe's efforts to end its reliance on Russian fossil fuels in response to Moscow's all-out invasion of Ukraine. In May, the EU is expected to present a plan for a full phase-out of Russian fossil fuels by 2027.

>""We completed another step toward our energy independence,"" Fiala told journalists at the central oil storage facility near Prague alongside Finance Minister Zbynek Stanjura and Jaroslav Pantucek, director of the state-run oil transit company MERO.

>Officials said Czechia has not been receiving Druzhba oil for several weeks. In recent years, Russian oil covered roughly half of the country's demand.

>Prague expects up to 8 million metric tons of oil from the western pipeline per year, which should be sufficient to cover its needs.

>While the EU banned Russian pipeline oil imports in 2022, Czechia, Slovakia, and Hungary received a waiver from the ban due to the lack of viable alternatives.

>Already in November 2022, the Czech government decided to launch the TAL-PLUS project to secure an alternative oil supply. Technical work on the project began in May 2024, and the same year, Prague said it would not seek an exemption from the ban on Russian oil.

See the video above. It's taken on a beach just north of the sunshine coast that's inaccessible by 4x4, is 20km from the nearest walking track, and is rarely visited by anyone in boats. Only a handful of people would set foot on these beaches each year. Without anyone being aware of the amount of rubbish, it's 'out of sight and out of mind'. The water should be crystal clear, but it and the mangroves are full of tiny bits of broken down plastic that's only breaking down further and becoming more of a problem.

90% of our coastline in Australia is either inaccessible, or very rarely visited. Our plastic problem is much worse than most people realise.",3,2025-04-06 00:50:46,NetTop6329

worldnews,1k4nhv8,mobbxic,"""Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Monday that her government had asked television stations to pull an advertisement by US President Donald Trump's administration warning against undocumented migration because it could incite violence.

She said Mexico's government had written to private TV channels urging them to stop showing the message, which has been aired during prime-time programs such as major league football.

Reading the letter at her morning news conference, Sheinbaum said that the ad ""contains a discriminatory message that violates human dignity"" and could encourage ""violence against people on the move.""

The ad is part of a multimillion-dollar international campaign announced by Trump's Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February in radio, broadcast and digital formats in multiple countries.

""If you are considering entering America illegally, don't even think about it,"" Noem warns in the message, which in Mexico has Spanish subtitles.

If a migrant commits a crime, ""we will hunt you down"" because ""criminals are not welcome,"" she adds.

Trump has ramped up pressure on Mexico to tackle undocumented migration and drug trafficking, leading Sheinbaum to deploy extra troops along the border as part of efforts to avoid his sweeping tariffs.""

Edit: Based on the video from Bangkok, it's likely the damages from this earthquake extend well further than what is usually expected. It is possible that there are unknown fatalities as well. 

Thoughts and prayers to all those affected. 

\------------------

[What you need to know:](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us7000pn9s/executive) Edited to reflect change in pager.

\------------------

* At 12:50:54 PM on the 28th of March, 2025, a 7.7 earthquake struck 16km NNW of Sagaing, in Central Myanmar.
* The quake is currently reported to have occurred at a depth of 10km, which is very shallow. The depth of the quake can help soften the shaking experienced at the surface, the deeper a quake is, the more widespread it's felt, but the softer the shaking. Typically at least.
* The current shake map shows expected IX shaking which can be described as **Violent** and with **Heavy Damages**.
* The Pager currently provides the following probabilities:
   * 34% probability that the final toll is between 10k and 100k dead. There is a 56% chance that the toll is above 10k.
   * 34% probability that the total cost if between $10-$100 billion. There is a 56% probability that the total cost is higher than $10b.

\--------------------

A major aftershock of 6.4 occurred 12 minutes later which could be good news regarding expected future aftershocks. Typically we expect an aftershock of 1.0-1.2 of the original shake.

All data may be reviewed and updated by the USGS, as more data and understanding comes in.

No news about when we will be allowed back inside (I need my passport and shoes, preferably) but I'll keep updating.

UPDATE: Some people are being allowed back into buildings, but hotel guests are being asked not to enter their rooms, yet.

ADDED UPDATE: They are telling us that the aftershock has passed, too small to feel. Alarms on the street have been turned off. Still unable to enter hotel, but at least it seems the worst has passed? (No jinxing, please)

Final update: Was released back into the hotel. My hotel was very well organized and got me to my room quickly. There are cracks in the walls, but nothing structurally unsound. Keeping an eye on any updates regarding the earthquake.",358,2025-03-28 07:44:14,evesara_
