It’s shockingly easy:

In a large pot, slowly bring a gallon of pasteurized (not ultra-pasteurized) whole milk to 200°F (93.3°C), but do not allow it to boil, stirring frequently. Add 1 teaspoon of table salt.  Once its to temperature, remove from heat and gently add 1/3 cup (80ml) freshly squeezed lemon juice. Stir gently for a moment. Cover and let sit for 10 minutes. The mixture should separate into curds and whey. After 10 minutes, with a slotted spoon or skimmer, gently remove the curds and place into strainer lined with cheese clothe. Let drain at room temperature for up to one hour. Refrigerate or use immediately.",2,2025-03-26 05:12:00,excti2

There are usually several leftover at the end of the day when everything else is sold out, which is the reason I tried one. What I wanted wasn't available one day, so I discovered these amazing creations.",7,2025-04-05 06:07:55,GhostfaceDylan

\- Once chicken is all crispy and cooked, heat up sesame or peanut oil in a wok till smoking, toss in garlic/ginger/peanuts, after about 30 seconds toss in dried red chilli and sichuan pepper corn. stir around for a couple minutes till fragrant and garlic slightly browning.

food,1k0t68q,mngnb86,"Cooked the chicken low and slow. It was a set-it-and-forget-it recipe, and it came out so tender and juicy!

Ingredients: 

* 4-5 Pound Whole Chicken
* 3 tbsp Butter
* 2 tbsp Olive Oil
* 2 tsp Salt
* 1 tsp Pepper
* 3 Cloves of garlic, minced or grated
* 1-2 onions quartered

* **Preheat** your oven to 325°F. Prepare your roasting pan or a large cast-iron or heavy pan by laying out the quartered onions in a circle on the bottom of the pan.
* **Pat the chicken dry** with paper towels and place it on top of the quartered onions.
* **In a small bowl**, mix together the olive oil, minced garlic, salt, and pepper. **Rub the garlic oil mixture** generously all over the chicken, including under the skin and inside the cavity if possible.
* Add the 3 tablespoons of butter to the top of the chicken and r**oast** uncovered for 2.5 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F and the skin is deeply golden and crisp.
* **Let rest** for 10–15 minutes before carving to lock in all the juices.",12,2025-04-16 19:32:40,lonelyisland789

food,1k14zxt,mnkyzz5,"I'd eat that! Nice!

A couple of tips...

When you cut the fat, do it in a nice and tight diamond pattern, i.e. don't do the cuts a right angles...

Then, get the kettle on and boil some water. Put the duck breasts onto a rack over the sink and pour some boiling water over the skin/fat side only.

You'll see that it will dissolve some of the fat and contract the rest.

Pat the duck dry and now start in a cold dry skillet (no added fat), skin side down on a low heat.

Slowly let most of the fat render out, that will be plenty to provide you with all the fat you need to cook.
Then turn up the heat a little, and once the skin is nicely golden and crispy, you can flip the duck and add your thyme.

Pat the skin side with a paper towel for some extra crisp, don't baste, it's not a steak and it'll just get your nicely crispy skin soggy again.

Cook another couple of minutes until nice and pink, remove from skillet and let rest.

Now do your sauce, add a little butter, fresh orange juice, splash of lemon, and reduce while the duck is resting.

If you're feeling fancy, strain your sauce to get the bits of thyme out... Season to taste with salt, pepper (and a little sugar if you like it a little sweater). 

Optionally flambé with a dash of Grand Marnier or Southern Comfort or some orange liqueur.

Same ingredients, nothing fancy, just a little added technique and you'll have your dish at the next level!

food,1k0z5df,mnl0x0y,"Chicken Meatballs:

    2 lbs. ground chicken
    2 large eggs, slightly beaten
    3 cloves garlic, minced
    3 Tbsp. olive oil
    1 cup seasoned panko crumbs
    3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
    1 tsp. onion powder
    1 tsp. kosher salt
    1 tsp. black pepper
    1/2 tsp. paprika

Sauce:

    5 Tbsp. butter
    4 cloves garlic, minced
    2 tsp. Italian seasoning
    1/4-1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes, add to your liking
    1 cup sundried tomatoes in oil, drained and roughly chopped
    1/4 cup white cooking wine
    1 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
    1 cup heavy cream
    2/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
    8-10 fresh basil leaves, julienned, if desired for garnish

Instructions
 
Chicken Meatballs

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Lined an extra large baking sheet or two large baking sheets with parchment paper. Set aside.

In a large bowl, combine all ingredients for meatballs and gently mix together. Do not over mix. Use a 1 1/2-inch scooper and scoop meatballs onto trays. Bake for 18 minutes until lightly browned and no longer pink inside. Remove from oven and set aside while you make the sauce.

Sauce

In a large oven-proof deep skillet, melt butter over medium heat.

Add the garlic, Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes and sundried tomatoes and cook over medium heat, stirring often for 2 minutes. Add the wine and cook for 2-3 minutes until mostly cooked down. Add the chicken broth, then slowly add the heavy cream and Parmesan and whisk until well combined. Continue to cook until sauce starts to thicken slightly, stirring occasionally.

Add the meatballs to the sauce and mix until the meatballs are well coated. Transfer the skillet to the oven and cook for about 10 minutes until the meatballs are heated through and the sauce is bubbly. Serve immediately.",5,2025-04-17 13:43:25,Fredi_ManYeti

food,1jynsbq,mmzu9vp,"Checked off a bucket list cooking item this weekend by making ramen from scratch for the first time. Came across u/Ramen_Lord's miso recipe on Friday morning and ended up here on Sunday night. I followed his recipe basically to the letter as best I could minus the sesame seeds in the tare and the bean sprouts in the vegetable topping because the selection at my local Asian grocery store didn't look so hot. Also, my grocery store didn't have enough pork neck bones for the required 4 pounds, so I subbed in some unsmoked hocks to make up the difference. 

All in all, it was a lot of work, but it was incredible and well worth the effort. I should have added more soy to the tare for my personal tastes, and I should have bit the bullet and made a full chachu instead of the little mini bois I did. Bought pre sliced pork belly and rolled the slices up to have a few smaller ones, which worked, but I would have liked some more in my bowl. I will 100% be making more ramen in the future. 

It was an exercise in patience, skill, endurance, and elegance, and I loved every second of it.",13,2025-04-14 01:54:25,Horrible_Harry

food,1jwgh5n,mmi7xkn,"Tonkatsu

Score the fatty edge to avoid cupping, salt and dry brine for a few hours, then bake in a 250°F oven until 130°F internal. Flour > beaten egg > panko, frying at 375°F until browned and internal reaches preferred temp, I like 145 to 150°F. 

Tonkatsu sauce

½ cup ketchup 

2 tsp Worcestershire

2 tbs shoyu 

2 tsp sugar, my preferred ketchup is low sugar

1 tsp grated ginger

1 tsp grated garlic

1 tbs mirin 

Mix well and keep in the fridge, I did this when I put the chops in the oven. 

Cabbage

I bought a nifty cabbage shredder, so fun but up until now using a sharp knife has worked just fine! Shred into ice water. Normally I don't think it's dressed but a toss in some rice vinegar helps to cut through the heavy meal. 


Rice

Use your fav, I'm partial to Nishiki sushi rice.

food,1jnfv88,mkjd8hi,"**Spaghetti and Meatballs (serves four)**

**Meatballs**

+ 500g beef mince (or 1/2 beef and 1/2 pork)
+ 1/2 an onion, finely diced
+ 2 large cloves of garlic, grated
+ 2 tbsp grated parmesan (parmigiano-reggiano)
+ 2 tbsp parsley, finely chopped
+ 1 egg
+ 1 thick slice or bread, blitzed to breadcrumbs
+ 4 tbsp of milk
+ 3/4 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper, chilli flakes and pinch of nutmeg

+ Soak breadcrumbs in milk for 10 minutes. Saute onions until softened.
+ Squeeze breadcrumbs to get rid of excess milk, and add all other ingredients. Mix until homogeneous.
+ Use an ice cream scoop or tablespoon to devide mixture into balls. Dip the spoon/scoop into some water between each scoop to stop the mixture from sticking. If using an ice cream scoop, half each ball.
+ Using slightly damp hands, roll each ball until smooth. You should now have about 20 meatballs. Rest them in a fridge while you make your sauce.

**Tomato Sauce**

+ 2 400g tins of tomatoes
+ 1 onion, chopped
+ 3 cloves of garlic, minced
+ 1 tbsp tomato puree
+ 1/2 tsp chilli flakes
+ 1/2 tsp dried thyme
+ 1/2 tsp dried oregano
+ 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar, 1 tsp honey

+ Saute onion until translucent. Add garlic and chilli flakes and fry for a minute. 
+ Add tomato puree and fry for a minute before adding the other ingredients and half a tin of water.
+ Add a pinch of salt and pepper and simmer for 30 minutes.

+ While you sauce is simmering, either fry or grill (broil) the meatballs until browned on both sides, drain on kitchen roll to get rid of excess grease.
+ Add the meatballs to the sauce and simmer for a further 30 minutes.
+ 10 minutes before the meatballs are done, boil your spaghetti in salted water until al dente, use 100-125g per person. Reserve the pasta water.
+ Remove the meatballs from the sauce, check sauce for seasoning and add your spaghetti. Mix until the sauce is coating the spaghetti, add some pasta water as needed to get the desired consistency.
+ Devide the spaghetti between four plates and top with the meatballs.
+ Garnish with chopped parsley or basil and grated parmesan. Enjoy!",2,2025-03-30 16:13:44,SquareGoYaBam

The buttermilk leftover from making butter, isn't currently the typical Buttermilk used to make biscuits/pancakes/etc.

It is natural buttermilk, but what's typically used today is Cultured Buttermilk. So while it serves the same purpose, it won't really have the same result (missing the tang).

food,1jty3no,mlxtrde,"When the days say 10 days let it go as long as you’re comfortable. Just make sure to Ph it for safety. This one went 35 days

Lacto fermented habanero sauce/salsa

1 lb habanero peppers (any peppers)(destemmed you can deseed if needed I don’t.)

1 large white onion (sliced to fit through mason jar opening)

1 whole garlic bulb

1 large red bell pepper (or any color but green bell)

24 grams Canning salt

1 quart cool Filtered water

1 - half gallon wide mouth ball jar

Dark room temp location for 10 days

To do:

Wash all peppers.

Peel garlic and add to jar

Slice bell pepper into slices that will fit into jar I usually cut into 8ths.

Slice onion same way to fit through mouth of jar

Add habanero to jar

Top with glass puck and press if needed to acquire more space. You want to leave about a half inch to inch in the top.

Mix salt and water together until salt dissolves. Pour brine into jar until it covers the glass puck.

Seal with ferment lids and use pump to remove excess air from jar. Place in a dark, room temp location undisturbed for 10 days. You can peek at the jar and see if there are bubbles forming and floating to the top. This means it’s working! Just don’t open it!

After 10 days remove lid and assess. If done properly there may be some white film residue or what appears to be sea foam on the sides. This is a byproduct of some fermentations and is called Kahm yeast, perfectly harmless and naturally occurring. As long as there is no color (green, black) the mold can be wiped away.

Strain the fermented pepper mix to over a large bowl and collect the fermented brine. Add the pepper mix to a blender. (Watch the fumes they’ll gas you) blend and slowly add more brine to reach the desired consistency. You can save any left over brine and add cucumbers to make some spicy pickles or what ever you want.

Refrigerate after bottling. Serve chilled. Do not cook the salsa as it will lose any probiotic value. Chilled shelf life at least 6 months. But I have never had it last that long. Shits good yo.",16,2025-04-07 22:26:32,t-o-m-u-s-a

1½ pounds cream cheese softened, 3–8-ounce bricks

1 pound strawberries hulled

1¼ cup sugar

¾ cup heavy cream

¼ cup sour cream
