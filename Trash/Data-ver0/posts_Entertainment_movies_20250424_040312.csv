I love tagging along as they piece things together, leading to a mind-blowing reveal and plenty of twists along the way.

movies,1k2c5bj,"Movies with the most compelling and fleshed out villains, in your opinion?","As the title says. This question came upon me as I'm re-watching Kill Bill and admiring the development put into all the main targets of the movie. Whether or not they're actually /villains/ in the full context of the word is up for debate I guess, but you guys know what I mean. They're the enemies, at the very least.

They didn't feel /just/ like targets to be defeated, but like their own individual person- which you'd figure would be granted in movies, but I feel many villains end up just being, well, villains just for the story, if that makes sense. It's definitely something that really draws me into the story being told in the movie, gives me a bit more of a reason to care about what's happening.

movies,1jq4bns,Just wanna say shout out to the 90s,"Seriously I’ve been on one hell of a movie binge lately especially in the thriller genre and when I say I haven’t been disappointed yet I really mean it. All these films I’ve never seen but have always heard about and seen referenced but I never knew how much I was missing out. The 90s had so many amazing and influential movies it’s not even funny. My favorite is hard to pick but it either has to be The crow or silence of the lambs that are my favorites. I’ve seen those two, se7en, fight club, the usual suspects, the sixth sense, blade runner, pulp fiction and I can go on but the rest are 2000s or later movies like Warrior or Blade runner 2049 and inglorious basterds. 

Some films even when you know the twist can’t take away from just how great they are. Some films I definitely enjoyed more than others but when people say some of these films are the best or just the best in their genre I can see why. I think as someone who likes any genre other than romance no offense to the romance lovers of course I’ve never been more satisfied in the films I’ve watched. Maybe I’m blowing it out of proportion but I just wanted to make like a 90s movie appreciation post and can’t imagine what it was like seeing these twists in theaters like the usual suspects.

I watched this film like 2 years ago, and seriously, it still hunts me. It was worse then any horror film I ever watched, precisely because it had no ghosts or monsters or demons. It was purely the realty of the world we live in, portrayed in a haunting,  grotesque manner.

 It just keeps popping up in my thoughts. What the father went through, how the mother and child died, that highway scene... everything was so uncomfortable to watch. I keep imaging how it will feel to loose the people I love the most in such a cruel way. I keep imagining how the father felt, as he watched his family taken, how the mother and daughter felt, knowing they are going to die... 

And the scene were they find their bodies, just slumped together, naked and raped on some moth-eaten couch in a junk yard. Their lifeless eyes... it was horrible. 

I recognize the film is a masterpiece, but I so wish I never watched it.

[Here's a wiki link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locked_(film))

[Here's its Rotten Tomatoes page](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/locked)

Quick synopsis: a man turns his car into a booby trap that locks-in the next person attempting to steal from it. That next person is a petty thief ironically looking to fleece items for a car repair. Torture of both the psychological and physical nature ensues.

I enjoyed it overall. Keeps good tension overall, and the characterization is solid. Skarsgard puts on a good performance, which is good since he's 90% of the screentime. It's also bloodier than I expected, like the movie is one really elaborate test from the Saw franchise. It gets somewhat political, with ""William"" the car owner being a bundle of Conservative talking points, but his actions establish him as the bigger villain overall even if you agree with his ideology (and I don't think you're supposed to, anyway. Some parts of his statements come off as plain wrong, and he gets called out by Eddie for being a psychopath).

movies,1k5egiq,I Saw the TV Glow and We’re all going to the Worlds Fair capture loneliness in a way I’ve never seen before.,"SPOILERS for We’re all going to the Worlds Fair and I saw the TV Glow

I know their movies are not for everyone but I just finished watching We’re all going to the Worlds Fair and I saw the TV Glow and was blown away.

 I grew up having no close friends, being homeschooled for a big chunk of my childhood and having basically no parental supervision so I watched a lot of movies, TV shows and anime and I would become totally engrossed in whatever I was watching at that moment, if I was watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Dragon Ball Z or Inuyasha it was all I talked about, and all I thought about and I would go to sleep thinking about those shows. The characters in the shows actually felt like my friends and the fantasy world became more real than real life. 


When I saw I saw the TV Glow I’ve never connected with a movie on that level before. The main character becomes obsessed with a TV show and he has a very surface level relationship with his only friend where all they have on common is their obsession for that TV Show.  Just like the main character, later in the movie, I’ve also revisited old cartoons and shows that used to mean so much to me and was surprised how much they just looked like crappy kids shows.

One thing I liked about We’re all Going to the World Fair is unlike a lot of movies that portray depression this was just about a normal kid. I really hate the “depressed teenager who is an incredible artist or musician” archetype. I thought it was refreshing to see a movie about a normal sad person.


I can’t speak to the “trans” aspects of the films but I can relate to being isolated and uncomfortable in your own skin.

But upon watching, I must say I was very impressed by this movie. It was very much a throwback to 90's action flicks. The plot was predictable, the action was over the top, and the one-liners were corny. It just worked so well.

The only thing that makes this movie work is the casting for the lead protagonist and antagonist. Viola Davis, and Anthony Davis are not winning Oscars for this movie, but their character portrayals were top notch. The scene were Viola Davis' character describes her time time in the military was gripping and emotional. I wasn't prepared for that in a shoot 'em up flick. And the scene shared with Viola Davis and Anthony Starr discussing the villain's motivation was incredible. Great chemistry between them. 

Bonus shout out to Ramon Rodriguez. His portrayal of a badass secret service agent was superb. He was the perfect foil for the President. 

Overall this was a good popcorn flick. I recommend it for some 90's style action. The obvious comparisons are Die Hard, and Air Force One, so that's great company to be in. ",27,0.71,78,2025-04-16 00:53:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1k07yyg/g20_discussion/,Patman350
movies,1jvzqn3,"What movie that shouldn't make you cry, made you cry?","We've all seen our tear jerker movies; Schindler's List, Sophie's Choice, Requiem For A Dream, etc, or movies with iconic sad moments like Iron Giant or Bambi. 

But what movie made you cry when it wasn't really supposed to? 

For me, this movie was Bill and Ted Face the Music. Seems like the least likely movie in the world to make you cry, right? Well, I watched it with my wife for the first time the other night. For some bizarre reason, we merged our Final Destination marathon with our Bill and Ted marathon; we'd watch a couple Final Destinations, then a Bill and Ted per night over a few nights. The contrast was surreal; Death goes from killing people with Rube Goldberg level complexity in Final Destination, to chilling and playing bass in Bill and Ted. None of those movies were particularly sad in any way, I just laughed as people were splattered in Final Destination and as Bill and Ted rocked out. 

Then Face the Music hit me in the feels in two ways. First, it didn't feel the same without Rufus; George Carlin is one of my favorite comedians, one that my dad introduced me to(after I'd already grown up listening to Carlin narrate Thomas the Tank Engine. I was shocked by his comedy at first to say the least.) It was nice to see the hologram, but it made me miss ol' George that much more. The second was the ending, when Bill and Ted realize it's their daughters that write the song that unites the world (and realty), not them, and they kind of pass the torch to them and offer their support. And I just lost it.

 My dad committed suicide this past December, and it's still a really sore spot for me. He was the one who showed me the first two Bill and Ted movies as a kid, and introduced me to heavy metal and horror movies. When I came out to him as transgender, he embraced me as his 'favorite(and only)' daughter and didn't judge in the slightest, even if it was a little bit of an adjustment. I introduced him to my girlfriend, now my wife,  and he was happy for us and thought we were cute together.  I know I'm carrying on the torch for him in a lot of ways. To see Bill and Ted be so chill with their daughters(who are the very least throwing off queer vibes), and be proud of what they accomplish,  just resonated with me because that is almost the exact kind of chill relationship we had. I was a mess. I'll never get the chance to watch it with him and talk to him about it. 

So, now that I've made myself cry all over again, I'll turn the question on to you. What movies made you cry that probably weren't intended to ? ",24,0.69,181,2025-04-10 14:48:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jvzqn3/what_movie_that_shouldnt_make_you_cry_made_you_cry/,LyraFirehawk

I didn't read any relevant introductions in advance, but I roughly knew that it was a film themed around ""law and justice."" When I got to the cinema and started watching, I realized that it was actually a stage play, and what's more, it was a one-person show with a dense flow of lines. I was truly in awe of Jodie Comer's acting skills. At first, I was wondering why there was no scene change and why there were no other lawyers. It wasn't until more than 30 minutes later that I realized it was a one-person show. However! She was so deeply immersed in her performance, and I began to get into the rhythm of her lines. I think the most ingenious part was when she, originally a ""litigation lawyer,"" went to the court to face cross-examination. The transformation of her character signified the shift and questioning of her thoughts about the judicial system. Of course, the content itself also reminded me of Ito Shiori's ""The Black Box.""

movies,1ju39lg,Stand by me(1986),"

So I just watched stand by me and it was an amazing ride. I think my favorite character throughout the entire film had to be Chris. I feel like each character brought their own little charm to the group but Chris really stuck out but in the best way. Seeing him support Gordie and the speech he gave him about his writing and how he believes in him was amazing but it was also sad hearing him talk so badly about his self later on and even a teacher using him as leverage all cause she knew they wouldn’t believe him.

 Thing is I want to say each grew but I’m not sure Vern and teddy did but that’s not knocking them since I enjoyed them but by the end they seemed to have grown slightly but I’m sure that’s do in fact to seeing a dead body. Gordie having to come to terms with his brothers death and even speaking to the dead boy like he was his brother was really heartbreaking. Everybody was always comparing him to his brother and the only people who ever seemed like knew the real him was his friends or the only ones who wanted to see the real him.

I could go on but I feel like I’d have too much to say but each character seems to have their own trauma or struggles they have to get through and by the end it feels like they go from boys to men. It feels like based on the stares and somber attitude they realize this isn’t a joke, someone lost their life and it’s fleeting and should be taken seriously, a childish adventure turned into a road into adult hood. Sorry if I sound like an idiot and reading into what happened wrong but it’s either trauma or growing up and I hope it’s the latter. Even the ending caught me off guard but it feels real to me, how life is fleeting and it can be taken away at any given moment no matter how good your intentions or you as a person may be.

movies,1k4cgmv,Revisit Lake Placid,"There are a number of films that I think perfectly encapsulate their genres, and I'd like to put forth Lake Placid as the epitome of creature-features.

It's hard to say that it's better than Jaws, which defines the genre, but in terms of the best follow ups, I think Lake Placid and Tremors reign supreme.

And while I have a deep love for Tremors (pun intended) I think Lake Placid's dialogue and acting is far superior. 

Betty White as a foul-mouth old farm lady, Oliver Platt as a smarmy yet charmy billionaire, and Brendan Gleeson as the dry-witted sheriff absolutely sparkle as the supporting cast, around the fairly boring Bridget Fonda + Bill Pullman leads. 

The CGI is decent, the dialogue is Shakespearean, and the overall product is absolutely stellar. It is everything a 90s movie wanted to be and if you've never seen it do yourself a favor and check it out.",21,0.7,23,2025-04-21 12:37:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1k4cgmv/revisit_lake_placid/,NeedNewNameAgain

The dreary, gothic setting of an isolated manor home in Jersey; the eccentric mother, Grace, who mourns for her husband to come home from the war; and the uncanny feeling that everything is not as it seems.

movies,1jwaiwn,What’s your dream pairing of a Director/Actor for a film?,"For me, I would love to see a Tarantino movie with Daniel Day-Lewis. Could you imagine Tarantino’s script and dialogue in the hands of DDL? Everybody brings their A-game when showing up to a Tarantino set, established actors or not. Day-Lewis is the game.

I once read somewhere that Day-Lewis spent roughly a year preparing for his role in “Lincoln.” The product of course, was mesmerizing. It’s one thing to bring a fictional character to life. It’s quite another thing when somebody can bring back an iconic figure in history back from the dead, so convincingly that it felt as Day-Lewis simply held a seance and channeled the President himself. 

Tarantino needs no argument here. 

Honestly neither does Day-Lewis for that matter. 

I believe the level of craftsmanship of both Tarantino and Day-Lewis coming together would be a force to be reckoned with and a cinematic feat of achievement that would be unparalleled.

I rewatch it maybe every 3-5 years or so and every time I am blown away about that this movie from 1981 not feels old one bit in the technical department.

Except the exceptional direction, execution and cast, What makes it remarkable is that is not just ""another great war movie"" where you at some point, directly or indirectly will be fed with morals, and the movie will make sure that by the end of it, you will know the good guys from the bad ones. I don´t say it is necessarily a bad thing but I think it is much more difficult to make a ww2 movie that will not in the slightest give a hint of the moral shortcomings of the germans (or the japanese).

This is I think the core to what makes Das Boot a unicorn. It balances a really touchy subject so masterfully that no one can blame it for being either too political and pretentious, but it´s not lame and totally avoiding on the other side either. It just feels very real and honest.

So what is your take on Das Boot?",18,0.62,39,2025-04-04 13:05:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jrbe9c/what_makes_das_boot_so_darn_good/,mrbluetrain

movies,1k0eibh,"I can’t stop thinking about They Shoot Horses, Don’t They ?","I came across it on youtube and have always been intrigued by it. I was sleepy but I started it just to watch a little of it, and I couldn’t stop. This movie fucked me up. 

The level of desperation and hopelessness in this is powerful as hell. Every actor in the cast is outstanding , but Jane Fonda gives possible a career best performance (and it’s one of her earlier ones), Susannah York is haunting and flawlessly portrays a woman who’s psyche is slowly being destroyed, and Gig Young rightfully won an Oscar for his performance. What happened to him later in his life (murder/suicide) just adds another layer of dread. 

Sydney Pollocks direction is phenomenal.  The editing, the pacing, the palpable hell of the scenario is genuinely unsettling and unsparing. It feels like a waking nightmare. The fact it is based on the real dance marathons during the depression is just so devastating. Humanity at its worst and most frail. 

The ending lands at least five big gut punches and left me so overwhelmed, but I loved every moment of it. This has instantly found its way into my favorite films of all time, but it will probably be a while before another viewing. It’s impossible to forget , though. 

Finally, the greatest punch in the face is how timely and relevant it remains , despite being a film from the 60s, about the great depression a few decades earlier. I kept thinking of all of those Mr. Beast competitions, it’s sickening. 

I’ll leave it at that for now, but definitely check it out if you haven’t. But if you’re in a bad frame of mind maybe wait until you’re in a better mood.

movies,1jud61p,House of Gucci (2021),"House of Gucci isn’t exactly a _good_ movie, nor is it a terrible one, but it’s a pretty good Terrible Movie (capitalization required here). That quality is due almost entirely to Lady Gaga’s performance as Patrizia Reggiani & the strength of the script: “Patrizia is correctly pegged by the Gucci patriarch as a tasteless hobag gold-digger…and is also the only other competent Gucci” is a very strong irony/punchline.

The film as a whole is a solid-enough farce all things considered; the one real problem is that director Ridley Scott seems to be the only person involved not to realize it – and this reflects itself in the poor cast control. Gaga is great & Salma Hayek is game as TV psychic/gal Pina, but Jeremy Irons’ Rodolfo Gucci (the aforementioned patriarch) is the only other person who’s even kinda trying. Adam Driver is uncharacteristically weak as deuteragonist Maurizio Gucci, a mix between sleepwalking and obvious embarrassment at the rest of the film. Al Pacino & Jared Leto are both well into the Self-Parody zone (Leto’s Paolo being literally just Carl from _Aqua Teen Hunger Force_) – Scott tries to frame some of their interactions as dramatic, but these don’t land because of how ridiculous their characters are. The effect is that this isn’t deadpan so much as “cast rebellion against the director” – that clash between Scott’s serious take & the script’s “Patrizia’s the only competent Gucci” means that the ending (>!Maurizio’s assassination at Patrizia’s hand!<) leaves a sort of ashen taste in the mouth. 

Basically: Ridley Scott taking this seriously hamstrings rather than elevates the comedic potential – a director more in on the joke could’ve taken this to the heights of black farce. But as it is, it’s a fairly amusing movie that’s really fun if you’re watching it high.",20,0.69,22,2025-04-08 13:09:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jud61p/house_of_gucci_2021/,deeppurple1729

When the movie came out in 1978, as far as we know, no living thing had yet been cloned, although the necessary science and technology was nearly in place, as the movie also dramatically shows. In 1996, Dolly the sheep became the first cloned mammal, and supposedly a few years ago, a couple of kids were cloned or at least genetically engineered in China, though this isn't definitely known. In any case, I'd say the technology already exists for human cloning and genetic engineering, so what should we do about it, and how do we avoid a madman like Dr. Mengele, who in The Boys from Brazil was able to clone 94 copies of Adolf Hitler?

Besides the obvious ethical concerns this movie presents, I'd say the story and acting were quite excellent, especially Gregory Peck, who played the horribly evil and frightening Doctor of Death, Dr. Mengele, as well as Lawrence Olivier, who did an excellent job as Lieberman, an old Jewish spy who uncovers Dr. Mengele's evil plot and is able to stop him before he has a chance to create the Fourth Reich!",15,0.76,18,2025-04-03 06:06:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jqaxbc/the_boys_from_brazil/,dcterr

movies,1k3f34m,Jenny Curran’s Version of Forrest Gump,"Jenny Curran’s Version of Forrest Gump

I was born in Greenbow, Alabama, in a house full of ghosts and a man who didn’t know how to love anything but his fists and the bottle. My mother died young, and my sisters left. I stayed. I shouldn’t have. He took everything from me.

When I was a little girl, I’d climb high in the trees and pray to be a bird so I could fly far, far away. That prayer became a curse. I ran. For most of my life, I ran from pain, from people, from myself. I didn’t know who I was without the fear. I still don’t.

Then there was Forrest.

He was the only thing in my life that didn’t hurt. He didn’t ask questions. He didn’t judge. He didn’t even understand what had happened to me. And somehow, that made it easier. He saw something good in me I never saw in myself. But loving Forrest? That felt impossible. I wasn’t built for love. I was built for running.

I tried to escape the world in all the ways broken people do. Music. Protests. Drugs. Empty faces in dark rooms. I thought I was chasing freedom, but I was just spinning in circles, digging a deeper hole. I watched people die. Friends. Lovers. Parts of me. And I kept running.

When I saw Forrest again, he hadn't changed. Still staring at me with those wide eyes like I was made of gold. I slept with him because... I wanted to feel something pure. For a moment, I did. But I left. Because Forrest was clean, and I was dirt. He was a dream, and I was still stuck in a nightmare.

I found out I was pregnant a few months later. And for once, I didn’t run. I kept the baby. Our baby. But I never told Forrest. Not because I didn’t want him involved—but because I didn’t want to ruin him. He deserved peace. He didn’t need my wreckage dragging him under.

Years passed. I got sick. Something the doctors didn’t understand—mysterious, incurable, slow. When I felt the end creeping up on me, I did what I swore I’d never do. I called Forrest. Not because I wanted help. But because our son deserved to know the one good man I ever knew.

Forrest married me. He took care of me. He looked at me like nothing had changed. Like I wasn’t wasting away. Like I hadn’t burned every bridge I’d ever built. He forgave me before I even asked.

And when I died… I think that was the first time I ever felt truly safe.

P.S. needed to give Jenny love with all of those hate memes out there. I hope you enjoyed the story.",15,0.59,13,2025-04-20 05:04:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1k3f34m/jenny_currans_version_of_forrest_gump/,Fx_Trip

movies,1k0i2ny,the longest narrative film.,"last year, i made a post on this sub about logistics, an experimental movie that holds the distinction of being the longest feature film of all time. however, you may be inclined to wonder what the longest movie with an actual plot is. well, that honor goes to the 2019 indian drama amra ekta cinema banabo, which roughly translates to we will make a film.

written and directed by ashraf shishir, the film tells the story of a man living in the 1970s in post liberation war bangladesh. after being overcome with guilt about killing an ant, he meet an aspiring filmmaker who insist that life is just one big movie with god as the director. the filmmaker wants to make a movie and tells the man that he should be the hero of the film if he wants to repent for his sins. cue shenanigans.

the film's runtime is a whopping 21 hours. that's right. this movie about a guy feeling bad that he killed an ant is going to take you a vast majority of the day to watch. the film was shot over the course of 9 years beginning in 2009 and had no less then 4,000 crew members. 

as for the reception, the film currently boasts a 7 out of 10 on IMDB but a 49% on rotten tomatoes. make of that what you will.",17,0.7,12,2025-04-16 11:28:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1k0i2ny/the_longest_narrative_film/,herequeerandgreat

movies,1jtbjmj,65 should have been a lot better,"What could have been the closest we got to a Turok movie but instead was basically The Last of Us with dinosaurs.

Overall though IMO I still thought it was ok, at least a watch once if you're curious about the concept and idea, but damn man, it could have been executed better.

Make it R-rated, make it a group of survivors (Could still have the focus on Mills and Koa) to add in a kill count and have the dinosaurs be more accurate as well as feature herbivores which funnily enough during production that's what they originally intended, seriously why did they drop that? We would've had a three-legged anklyosaurus and instead of what I assume was an oversized rauisuchian, it was going to be a triceratops which would had been better to showcase herbivores aren't always peaceful and can be aggressive, the idea the triceratops would've been like a territorial hippo or wild boar.

Finally we had a threatical dinosaur film that wasn't another Jurassic sequel and I loved the concept and idea of ancient astronauts landing on earth during the dinosaur age trying to survive. It should've been so much more.

I'm hoping Primitive War which is releasing this year makes up for it.

movies,1k2fvng,My review on Chungking Express (1994),"Holy hell! What a ride that was.

First aspect to be noted is the absolutely perfect cinematography. Every shot perfectly encapsulates the chaos, impersonality and loneliness of big cities.

I was instantly captured by the first cop's views on heartbreak. The way he views the expiration date of the relationship and the reflection on the expiration date of memories is beautifully touching.

The scene of him calling a bunch of women to see if anyone wanted to go on a date with him almost felt like a foreshadowing of what became of the dating scene in a more modern world where everything is so fast and liquid. But here there is also a heartwarming side of it - how he is genuinely happy when one of the women says she is married. He doesnt want a hookup - just company. And thats what makes his character so relatable. His humbleness and positive outlook on life even when he is very clearly hurting and suffering.

And in the second part comes Faye Wong and California Dreamin. This second part is less mysterious and whimsical than the first one but the chemistry between the two actors and the sexiness of every innocent interaction is palpable through the screen.

The second cop talks to every element of his house as if he is talking to his lost love. So it seems appropriate that the character of Faye shows up to basically organize his life and take care of his apartment. 

The bittersweet element of the almost connection. Of the small little moments of connections and mismatches are carefully portrayed again beautifully capturing the city of Hong Kong, the late night diners, the coffees and beers as a living breathing character in the story. The big chaos of the city looking for a escape of the loneliness - just like our two characters.

The fact that she becomes a stewardess and is always traveling in the end portraits how things can change in the blink of an eye. People are unpredictable and independent. One day theyre here and in the other they are gone. Life just keeps going on. 

Its my first Wong Kar Wai movie and I was mesmerized through the whole thing. 

Would love to hear your thoughts.

What's more, I think they basically got it right about what happens after you die, which is pretty much in line with the Buddhist and Hindu beliefs in karma and reincarnation. However, I'd say the movie embraces too many superficial yuppie values from the 80s, with very little focus on how your actions affect others, not just yourself. What about the 30 or so people he accidentally killed on the bus? Shouldn't he have been punished for their deaths? And I think there's much more involved during the interim period between lifetimes than looking at a few critical days of your life to see what lessons you learned from them, in particular pertaining to dealing with fear. Sure, we all need to learn to deal with fear, which is a very big part of growth, but I think we need to learn a lot more lessons than just this, in particular, being responsible for the consequences of our actions, intentional or not, though intent carries a great deal more weight.

And now, they’re back at it again with the Sylvester Stallone-penned *A Working Man*, which is based on the novel “Levon’s Trade” by Chuck Dixon (a way better title than the Seagal-like *A Working Man*). 

[Casey's Movie Mania](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/3688) \- [Casey Chong](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/casey-chong)

>Some of the shortcomings aside, it’s worth noting that A Working Man is the first part of Chuck Dixon’s *Levon Cade* series, which has so far released a total of 11 books. For now, the movie gets off to a decent, though uneven beginning for a franchise starter and if there’s a sequel in the pipeline — depending on the first movie’s box-office result, of course — here’s hoping it improves for the next round.

[The Guardian - Jesse Hassenger](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/mar/26/a-working-man-review-jason-statham)

>At its best, a movie like A Working Man functions as an update to the hard-boiled detective story, with a resilient bruiser conducting his own off-books missing-person investigation. There’s a little of that juice as Levon does some amateur undercover work as a drug buyer, cozying up to a motorcycle gang (the aforementioned leader sits on a chrome throne, another touch that feels like Ayer’s doing). But Stallone and Ayer don’t have the patience for too much skullduggery; skullsmashery is more their thing, and as an action movie, A Working Man doesn’t reach the giddy highs of Statham’s best.

[Screen Rant - Mary Kassel](https://screenrant.com/a-working-man-movie-review/)

>It doesn't take an active imagination to see where the future of *A Working Man* is going. A few plots are left unresolved. Levon still has to win custody of his young daughter, paving the way for a sequel or two if the film makes a profit. Statham has proved himself an asset at the box office, and when it comes to movies like *A Working Man*, a critical reception has little to do with the project's performance. It's a mindless good time, and I'll be interested to see where the franchise goes.

[NextBestPicture - Dan Bayer](https://nextbestpicture.com/a-working-man/)

>For better or worse, “A Working Man” is pure brute force, barrelling through its standard (if overstuffed) plot with the subtlety of a sledgehammer, pummeling you into submission with its hard-hitting (if uninspired) fight scenes. You may not be wowed by the action on display here, but you feel every single body blow and gunshot. That’s exactly what you expect from a Statham vehicle, and that’s what “A Working Man” delivers, even if it doesn’t give you any more than that.

[The Reel Bits - Richard Gray](https://thereelbits.com/2025/03/27/review-a-working-man/)

>While never destined to revolutionise the genre, Ayer and Stallone have struck upon a reliable formula in a ready-made franchise package. One could happily consume these like fast food every couple of years, safe in the knowledge that there’s always another job for this working man right around the corner.

[Deadline](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2256) \- [Pete Hammond](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/pete-hammond)

>Ayer has made a bunch of films I really liked, particularly the cop drama *End Of Watch* which had a better role for Pena opposite Jake Gyllenhaal, and Brad Pitt’s WW2 tank epic, *Fury.* Here as in *Beekeeper,* he delivers a tightly wound action showcase for his star and keeps it moving along.

[Variety](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/466) \- [Peter Debruge](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/peter-debruge)

>This wasn’t how I envisioned Ayer’s career shaping up... A few of his movies are very good, but it increasingly feels like he’s recycling old plots, the way straight-to-tape action movies did in the late 20th century.

movies,1jjmiyj,"Mary Tyler Moore might have won the Oscar had she competed as Supporting Actress for ""Ordinary People""","I don't think anyone stood a chance against Sissy Spacek for ""Coal Miner's Daughter"". The movie was a hit and Spacek was praised by every critic in Tinseltown. She not only had the perfect narrative but she was also deserving. She acts and sings. I saw Coal Miner's Daughter and I can't disagree with her victory, even though I still have issues with how it minimizes domestic violence and I do feel Beverly D'Angelo should have been recognized for her turn as Patsy Cline (way better than Jessica Lange's take in Sweet Dreams). 

I think Mary Tyler Moore was completely memorable as Beth Jarrett. That character is such a prize for any actress, the degree of complexity and moral ambiguity and what Moore does in making Beth such a horrible mother but also someone who's hurting and afraid of breaking down and losing control. 

The role itself could have gone either way, lead or supporting. I do think she stood a greater chance at winning had she been placed as supporting. To this day, people talk more about Beth Jarrett than even the movie itself and I think that's a testament to how good she was.",16,0.64,12,2025-03-25 15:47:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jjmiyj/mary_tyler_moore_might_have_won_the_oscar_had_she/,LaserDiscCurious

movies,1jw0hrw,What are some of your favorite movie trailers?,"Here are some of mine:


Cruel Intentions: https://youtu.be/UzlKsS-IhEo?si=73QEZnZkFHTsKmat
 

- I like the way they blend music, and SMG is such a snake in this ... I love that it comes through in the feel of the movie. And gotta love that end cap scene, like trailers do. It's so representative of the movie and how tawdy and scandalous these characters are


Black Snake Moan: 
https://youtu.be/j7Z7Cf9IDGw?si=CFIIrIOBp9Zm0jSr


- I know a lot of people think this trailer gave the wrong impression of what the movie was actually about, but after seeing it I think it perfectly encapsulates what it's about. And the music is really well interwoven in it. But in particular I absolutely love the montage of Rhey giving into her vices, which I think a lot of us can relate to in one way or another for a lot of reasons. It's so colorful and punchy, and it's really cool how they edited it to mirror Rhey, giving it that pulpy vibe that's inherent in the movie's set up. Lastly, I think it's representative of how we glorify/romanticize hedonism (if that's the right word), despite how it might negatively impact our lives. 


Suicide Squad:
https://youtu.be/PLLQK9la6Go?si=wRjC2ZoWobUiK5dw


- Who didn't like this trailer? There's something special about it, with the song they used ... You can sense how impactful it should have been. But I personally suspect the reason people really vibe with it (and as is evidenced given the popularity of the character) is because it plays as though it's a story mainly revolving around Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn. I think there's something endearing about seeing people who exhibit different styles and qualities, which you get a wealth of here. It deepens people's sense of mystery and a person's complexity, but overall I think it's because she's high spirited, wild and free, while being kinda crazy that people see themselves (or who they wish they could be) in her ... A life force of epic proportions, going through the motions, but beautiful in their own peculiar and unique way. It's too bad the movie couldn't live up to this trailer. 

High Tension:
https://youtu.be/ZsfqXekOvJQ?si=5KxgKkZHuIdRNAHN

- This is a great little trailer for a relatively obscure horror movie. The cover song really makes it, as does the editing. 
Note that this isn't the exact trailer I was looking for, which lessens it's impact as an audio-visual wonder in my book. There's something missing right before it cuts to the chorus and things ramp up ... The original trailer was less jarring than that.

A neo-western/drama/mystery about what happens in a small Texas border town when a skeleton is found near an army base. A Sheriff, himself the son of a legendary Sheriff of the same town, investigates and find out it's not just connected to the town's dark past but his own as well. 

Really good performances across the board, with an ending that comes out of nowhere and gives me caution from recommending it to everyone I know (if you've seen it, you know) and then it just ends. 

All in all, a solid story about the past, our legacies, and what comes next.

movies,1jklhhf,The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie is One of the Best Animated Movies of the 2020s,"Absolutely loved it from start to finish. It promised everything and showcased why we love Looney Tunes especially on the big screen. This movie finally got the brand right as it did not need any celebrities, product placement, or anything pandering cranked up to 11.  
  
It had the full range of big screen theatrics from the eye-popping color palettes in each sequence to the symphonic musical score. Especially, there are some gags that have the full impact when with an audience. There are also some stand out sequences making full use of the medium, and it even shifts art styles from the movie including a sequence like the opening to Who Framed Roger Rabbit and an Art Deco style sequence that calls back to the Pink Elephants animation from Dumbo.  
  
Better than the last Space Jam movie, but overall, the best out of all theatrical Looney Tunes movies to date. I can't describe how well written it is from being an homage and spoof of 1950s sci-fi B movies to a self contained story focusing on Porky and Daffy's friendship exclusively for this movie. It works as a buddy comedy, and I loved what they did with Petunia in terms of her character and the romance subplot with Porky. Everything is built on Porky and Daffy's connection throughout. It works more in comparison to Bugs missing the Tunes when in fact he rarely interacts with them since the original shorts don't have them crossover.  
  
All movie exclusive characters were excellent. Farmer Jim, The Invader, and even the Scientist all had a huge part to play in the movie especially for the comedy.  
  
There are a lot of jokes coming in the moment the opening credits started to roll. For a PG rated family movie, they definitely have stuff adults can enjoy. References to John Carpenter movies like The Thing and They Live, some off-color humor, and it does not feel juvenile. There is subtle commentary coming from Petunia about taking risks and not wanting to be bland. I get that.  
  
The first time I saw it had plenty of audible laughs in the auditorium. There are plenty of surprises, twists, and stand out moments that showcase the animators going above and beyond what was supposed to be a made for TV/streaming movie. And I'm glad they reverted back to its original title, otherwise ""Bubble Brains"" would have been a tough sell.  
  
You have a lot to invest in, the stakes are convincing, and whatever movie conventions it tries doing, you couldn't help but smile the whole way through.

  
This movie is a monumental achievement in 2D animation and the comedy genre on its own. It will looked back as a cult classic, probably a potential pick on AFI's Top 100 Funniest Movies / Greatest Animated Movies list.",13,0.68,8,2025-03-26 20:15:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jklhhf/the_day_the_earth_blew_up_a_looney_tunes_movie_is/,rwinger24

- his anxious proposal which she turns down ergo
- his life becoming mundane and him waiting for her bus which moved Maggie
- their budding relationship; the cherry blossom stage all good all sweet
- comes the convention and acceptance phase altogether and

movies,1jji7ec,"Reevaluating the Ending of War of the Worlds (2005): A Quiet, Thoughtful Conclusion That Deserves More Credit","I’ve noticed that the ending of War of the Worlds (2005) is often criticized for being anticlimactic or lacking payoff. But I believe that judgment overlooks the quiet power and intention behind how the film chooses to conclude.

Unlike most alien invasion movies, this one doesn’t end with a dramatic final battle or human triumph through force. Instead, it reminds us that life on Earth has evolved with its own natural defenses, and that our survival sometimes comes not from strength, but from balance and design.

The aliens weren’t defeated by heroism or technology — they were brought down by bacteria, organisms too small to be seen but powerful enough to stop a superior force. It’s not a twist; it’s a statement. A reminder that for all our fears of the unknown, the world we live in is more intricate and resilient than we think.

The closing narration captures that perfectly — acknowledging the long struggle of humanity, and how even in our darkest moments, there’s a larger system at work that favors life. To some, that message feels underwhelming… but to others, it can be quietly profound.

I’d argue that this kind of ending isn’t a flaw — it’s intentional. Spielberg didn’t want another explosive victory. He wanted reflection. Humility. Perspective.

Sometimes, the most powerful endings aren’t the loudest ones.",14,0.6,30,2025-03-25 12:30:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jji7ec/reevaluating_the_ending_of_war_of_the_worlds_2005/,Ok_Establishment419
movies,1jjbjy7,What are the movies or quotes related to Regret that have changed your view of the world or life?,"Regarding ""regret,"" I've recently realized something. When watching movies before, I used to get so deeply immersive that I'd silently mutter to myself: ""Why did he do that? He'll regret it, what happens next?"" I noticed my grandmother does the same - I inherited this mindset from her, constantly regretting even the smallest things in life. But while rewatching some films recently, something suddenly hit me. Especially in “The Butterfly Effect”, where Evan tried to eliminate regrets by changing the past, but fell into a more tragic cycle. The mother's final advice is: ""Some things are better left forgotten."" This has started shifting my perspective. I should keep moving forward instead of always regretting the facts that cannot be changed. Some regrets have to become regrets as they are to truly define life.",10,0.65,9,2025-03-25 04:43:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jjbjy7/what_are_the_movies_or_quotes_related_to_regret/,kahnkahn0227
movies,1jizhnc,Looking for movie examples of a specific type of character...,"Doing some research and I’m looking for supporting characters in movies who don’t say much, but when they do, it really lands. They’re funny, witty, or clever, without being a bumbling idiot, loyal to a fault, maybe a little mysterious with an uncertain backstory, and often end up being the unsung hero or the emotional backbone of the ensemble cast or the movie. Perhaps they even save the day or save a particular scene or plotpoint.

Could be ensemble players, sidekicks, or even just a one-scene wonder that stuck with you. 

Any suggestions?

Potentially even a character that is just waiting for their moment to be called a pivotal moment someone asks for them and it’s one of those tropes where they are already dressed and ready to rock. That kind of thing.  Like if it was a character who always wanted to be in a band in the band finally asked him to play with them and he’s already ready to go.

movies,1jijo2o,Tyler Perry’s duplicity vs older films.,"Just finished watching and the only redeemable thing about this movie is Kat Graham. The twist with Kevin was predictable. He was acting like he didn’t care about Rodney’s death while his partner Caleb was so broken up about it. I also felt like it was quite obvious that he was shifting the blame onto Caleb and I couldn’t understand why no one brought up that Kevin was the one to yell out “Gun,” the entire movie except maybe once. 

I thought Tony’s friendship with Kevin was a little weird and suspicious because if I was friends with someone who had been involved in a shooting like that and didn’t seem to care, I would have serious concerns about being friends with them. That said, it was mildly surprising that Tony was also one of the ones behind everything, however, knowing that makes his interactions with Kevin make more sense. If Tyler Perry wanted to make it obvious that Kevin was a piece of shit, he succeeded. 

To touch on Fela: I found her grief over Rodney to be incredibly underwhelming (especially after finding out Rodney was cheating), and after watching the ending it makes so much sense why. After the four month time jump I was almost certain she was involved because who wins 15 mil and falls off the face of the earth from their only friend who was supposed to be her rock? 

In summary: I did not like the movie at all. While I enjoy Kat’s performance, I felt she could’ve done better. The entire story was rushed, the ending sucked, and the only thing that could’ve made it better was if Tony double crossed Kevin. I really hoped he would but alas, he was a piece of shit too.

I don’t know about anyone else, but I feel like Tyler Perry’s movies used to be good. I don’t know what happened over the years but they’ve gotten to be subpar. Movies like I can do bad all by myself, Diary of a mad black woman, and Why did I get married were a few of the ones I thought were pretty good. This one was absolute hot garbage. Anyone else agree?

movies,1k01322,Forrest Gump and importance of shoes,"While the film Forrest Gump has an obvious connection to shoes via his famous Nikes and the opening dialogue, I've noticed it continues deeper throughout. The film makes reference to shoes both through dialogue and visuals, a few of which I'm only noticing recently, which are as follows:

Gump's line to the first visitor on the bench about being able to tell a lot about a person by their shoes, to which she replies that her feet hurt. The woman is dressed as a housekeeper of some kind, and even though Forrest compliments their quality, she suffers. I believe this is making social commentary, whether it be about the struggle of the working class, or maybe about perspective on life, I haven't fully dissected.

Gump's own first shoes are connected to braces, maybe this speaks on perseverance in the face of adversity.

When Forrest and Bubba meet Lieutenant Dan, he tells them to take care of their feet and shoes due to rainfall and gangrene.

Lieutenant Dan loses his feet and is then completely lost in life, and mentions his struggling with the phrase ""walk with god"".

Lieutenant Dan only reconciles with his life after relinquishing to the ocean, effectively being off his legs altogether.

When Jenny is facing the decision to commit suicide, she is depicted standing on a ledge in the most flimsy, ankle-breaking heeled sandals, that teeter, which then snaps her to save herself. I think this might be speaking on the stability of her life or mental state.

Jenny is the one that gives Forrest his favorite shoes during what he calls the happiest time of his life. When she leaves he spends 3+ years with the shoes, running.

Jenny throws her shoes at her father's house. Her feet are filthy. Forrest's shoes are pristine.

Lieutenant Dan shows Forrest his new ""magic legs"", wearing very nice shoes, as he reveals a complete change in outlook on life.

The feather is shown at Forrest's feet at both the opening and ending.

There could be more; please comment if you think of any!

movies,1jqjrau,Highly recommend the Regal Unlimited pass,"I’m no shill for Regal, and have some problems with their lack of independent/lesser known films, for the record. 

I have recently quit drinking (91 days), and as a result, I have been sleeping much better, and therefore have been simply just having more time. The escapism and love of seeing films in a theater has been an even more intense passion, as it helps me deal with sobriety and provides a much-needed activity to steer the planning of my days around something other than drinking.

Anyway the Regal pass, for me here in Washington state, is $24.99. I am having a blast, taking on a fun challenge of trying to see literally every movie I possibly can. Definitely things I would never normally see or have zero interest in.

For instance, yesterday I went to the library for a bit, and at the theater next door realized the timing was perfect and just went to see Paddington In Peru on a whim. Because it was there. It was delightful! I am a 44 year old man without kids, and I would never have seen that otherwise. Then I took my dad to see the late show of the movie Locked last night, which i had wanted to see. We had a private screening, just the two of us!

After work and errands etc today, I’m going to see Captain America, and will probably be the only person in theater. I couldnt possibly care less about most comic book/Marvel movies, but hey, maybe it’ll be surprise me.

movies,1jmof6x,What movies would you recommend for older family members who haven’t really been exposed to films or literature throughout their lives?,"Looking for movies with which everyone should be familiar

My in laws are immigrants from a very rural area, “parents were subsistence farmers in the mountains” rural, and their academic education did not make it very far. 

As such, their exposure to literature, both written and filmed, has been limited. 

They’re very intelligent people, they watch the evening news every day and have no problem keeping up with the intricacies of *why* things happen, and can relate things happening in the US easily between patterns they’ve seen in El Salvador. 

However, their life experience has been limited to things they have personally experienced, and I believe the great value of literature is expanding our world beyond the lived experience. (I consider films to be literature, not just books)

As such, we would like to come up with a list of essentially the western canon, but in film. 

What are the movies you think everyone should watch, movies that set up or include structures seen in other works, movies that expose people to classic storylines, even if not the original story, and movies that are, above all, entertaining?

Bonus points if the movie is known to have a great Spanish dub. We want to avoid subtitles for now. 

Shrek would be a movie I consider part of the western canon, for example, and it has a great Spanish dub, but I would not feel it’s a good option to start them with it given that it requires knowledge or familiarity fairy tales, fantasy tropes, and satire to enjoy.

So, with this in mind, what are some films you think would be good for the goal of exposing our parents to these movies and build up their cultural knowledge, worldly experience, and enjoyment?",10,0.65,41,2025-03-29 15:12:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jmof6x/what_movies_would_you_recommend_for_older_family/,JulioCesarSalad

movies,1k1yh3u,[spoilers] Rewatched the Green Mile last night after finishing the audiobook,"I love how the movie really has you questioning your own morality in places. If I'd read Delacroix's crime on a reddit headline, I'd think exactly like those watching his execution. Yet seeing it in person, especially with how badly it went, well. No human deserves that.

Then again, his seven victims, even accidental ones, didn't deserve their fates either.

Another puzzle: Percy. He's such a disgusting scum guzzling slimeball that I can't help feel an odd perverse joy whenever he's bullied or assaulted in this movie. It's fun seeing him in pain when he's getting his ears tugged or the whimpers he makes in the restraint room. None of that compares to what he did to Del (and Mr. Jingles), and he likely never was punished as a child so it's long overdue.

Then I have to wonder: if I'm enjoying his pain, does that make me, on some level, as bad as him? For stepping on a mouse & tormenting a rapist/murderer does that make Wharton's sexual assault of Percy ""okay""? Did he deserve Coffey's ""punishment"", before he could go on to torment mentally ill patients at the asylum?

So many questions and no right or wrong answers, really. 

I cried three times tonight tho I know this film almost by heart. First at Del's execution, then at John watching the movie and lastly, of course, at John's execution. The awestruck, almost childlike joy in John watching the movie actually made me mourn a little. How I miss the days of simply enjoying things without, well, gestures vaguely at Current Events.

One of the themes is learning to accept yourself and not be ashamed of being weird. But stalking someone is weird and absolutely something to be ashamed of. It feels like the movie sabotages its own message.

Was this just the Daniels trying to make the story as bizarre as possible? I get that Dano's character is supposed to be weird and maladjusted and moderately creepy, but why take it that far?

I feel like so many stories and movies start with an amazing concept but then ruin it by not stopping sooner and making the story too complicated.

Just wondering if anyone  knows how I can purchase or stream a Cinema Twain?  has anyone seen it. and is it good?   From the you tube clips, it looks pretty good.

movies,1jpq98c,Night Moves,There are movies from the late great Gene Hackman that everyone has seen and there are ones few have seen.  “Night Moves” seems pretty obscure.  It is a nod to film noir.  Gene Hackman is great in it plus it features two very young but famous actors in Melanie Griffith and James Woods.  The plot twists hold up pretty well in terms of realism and believability.  The movie is super 70’s down to the fondue pots.  I strongly suspect that the final confrontation on the boat was an homage to “Key Largo” with Humphrey Bogart and Edward G. Robinson.,10,0.68,11,2025-04-02 14:41:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jpq98c/night_moves/,thebradman70
movies,1joq0bg,Spider-Man Into The Spiderverse felt like a dream.,"Spider-Man Into The Spiderverse felt like a dream. A very good one. I threw it into my Blu Ray player while feeling quite sick and did not expect very much. I am quite sceptical when it comes to superhero movies nowadays. But this one surprised me.

It tells a multidimensional story while staying simple enough for newcomers. With Kingpin and his supporters, not only does that story find a very well defined villain but also a clear direction in which it heads without having to tease some other stories along the way. 

Together with the soundtrack, which is filled with hip hop, it also manages to draw the feelings of a teenager and the conflicts he has to endure in a surprisingly empathic and realistic manner, so that the audience can easily connect to the protagonist.

The imagery is flawless. It's a living and moving comic panel, full of creativity and heart. The style changes quickly along the action yet it does not overwhelm the viewer so that they can follow along. 

All in all, it's a good movie that made use of its origins. I can understand why it's so beloved around cinephiles. And when it was over, it felt like a wild, weird but beautiful dream had just ended. That's how much it manages to pull you in at times.",11,0.57,9,2025-04-01 07:39:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1joq0bg/spiderman_into_the_spiderverse_felt_like_a_dream/,Phyliinx
movies,1jkw92c,Forgotten movie title about an author whose long erotic story went viral in the early days of the internet.,"Solved! Henry Fool

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Fool

I watched it in 2000. It was about a loser who wrote poetry no one cared about until he wrote an extremely long erotic story that spread around the internet. People had it printed out on dot matrix paper and couldn’t stop reading it.

The main character liked a girl whose boyfriend made him kiss her ass which he threw up on inside a convenience store.

Eventually he had a kid that he’d take to a bar and force to drink whisky.

Honestly I don’t think it was a good movie, but I watched it with a friend who was into watching independent film, and now I can’t get it out of my head.",7,0.55,13,2025-03-27 04:52:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jkw92c/forgotten_movie_title_about_an_author_whose_long/,ccminiwarhammer

I thought Meghann Fayh did a decent job. The only problem I found with the movie is I thought the villain was kind of predictable even with all the red herrings they included.

movies,1jv91gs,Spaceman (2024),"I just discovered this movie a couple days ago, watched it yesterday. It was emotionally overwhelming, the first time in years that I've shed a tear or two. Easily one of the best experiences I had in a while. Then I check out IMDB just to see a baffling 5.7 rating.

It's a really slow burn, very different from a usual Adam Sandler movie, Paul Dano is otherworldly, the visuals are not grandiose but excellent for this scale. I think it all fits together very well to bring home some powerful messages about loneliness, guilt, connection, what it's like to be a flawed human.

The grainy looks and old-new tech gives it some realism that usually is missing from modern movies.

I'll keep this spoiler free, if you got curious, please go in blind. I just wish we had more films like this, it hurts to see such low ratings, basically telling studios to keep going with shiny slop.",9,0.68,5,2025-04-09 15:47:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jv91gs/spaceman_2024/,Csenky

It's dot this dark, dry sense of humor, a bit of brutal weirdness, and some moments that are straight-up haunting, kind of like if the Coen brothers took a trip to rural Iceland and decided to make a film about people and horses. 

Visually, it's stunning. There's something about the way it captures isolation and the weird intimacy between the people and animals that feels super unique. It's not really like The Northman plot-wise, but if you were into the raw, mythic, earthy vibe of that movie, you might really dig this one.

movies,1jjbf1j,Revelation (2025) on Netflix is a decent thriller worth watching,"Had a go at this new release. Exceeded my expectations, which wasn't all that much after seeing the 6/10 IMDB ratings. However, it captured my attention for the near 2 hour runtime. A lot of religious evocations if you're ok with that sort of thing (I am), but still a decent crime thriller. I don't think I recognize any big stars but I'm not super familiar with all the entertainment industry in SK. Acting was quite decent by the main stars. I'd say 7/10.

Probably more plotholes than a swiss cheese but i'm not too critical about these details. ",10,0.72,6,2025-03-25 04:35:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jjbf1j/revelation_2025_on_netflix_is_a_decent_thriller/,princetonwu
movies,1k4y2pr,The Place Beyond the Pines,"I love this movie. I watched it again just now and it still holds up. There's just one thing I could never quite wrap my head around. What was the deal with AJ? 


I figure his weird mannerisms and weird way of talking were a byproduct of him trying to be a gangster or a tough cool kid, and also his drug habit. But is there something else that I'm missing? 


I've more or less figured that he approached Jason at first because Jason felt safe and non-threatening. I guess their similar tastes might have also made them resonate with one another, however briefly but rewatching the movie as an adult it seems self-evident that Jason didn't have many friends at school. 


So was AJ like a bully? Did he prey on people like this a lot? Was he gay? When Avery told him not to touch Jason did he mean figuratively? As in don't get near him? Or did he mean don't hurt him? I've always been fascinated by AJ. He's definitely a fraud with a mean streak but his relationship with his father is in shambles, and its pretty obvious he was only called out to live with Avery to bolster his campaign image.",9,0.74,4,2025-04-22 04:46:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1k4y2pr/the_place_beyond_the_pines/,BlightKagami

You must admit that the story of how a quiet, modest boy begins to study with a maniac in order to become a maniac himself is quite interesting.

The movie itself shows well how Cory goes from being such a nice guy to becoming a cold-blooded killer.
