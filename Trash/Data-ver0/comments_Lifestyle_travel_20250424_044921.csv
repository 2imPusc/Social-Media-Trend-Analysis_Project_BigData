I’m guessing you could fit Madrid in the trip and spend less time in Barcelona and Mallorca, but I’m not sure how relaxing that would be for you.

travel,1k1hnqu,mnnzzi7,"Peak hurricane season!

Some thoughts....

* packages are usually not a money saving thing, they save you time in planning as everything is done for you.  That being said - Costco is one of the better options.

* most of Caribbean is out(or at least a big risk), but not all.  Some islands(the ABCs for one) do not get hit too hard with hurricanes....usually.

* Clear, blue water and pretty beaches - this is the main thing you are looking for it sounds like.  Hawaii and Caribbean are really your main two options.  Pacific is not that clear unless you are in Fiji or S Pacific....which is no good for 5 days.  SEA - great for 2 weeks, not for 5 days(would probably fit your budget for 2 weeks)

Not a ton of options to be honest.  Can do SEA on the cheap, but need 2 weeks IMO.  Hawaii should be doable if you plan yourself and are flexible.  Caribbean islands - ABCs, TnT(more advanced), Grenada...have a few options.  Cartegena with a day trip to an island is another option....but that is not a ton of time on the beach.  Pacific side Costa Rica is nice, but no pretty blue waters....tons of nature, waterfalls, rain forests and the likes(also super safe).",1,2025-04-17 22:36:16,Shepherdless

travel,1k1grau,mnm5wsp,"> Is there stuff worthwhile in Southern Sumatra, or are we better off blasting full speed to Jakarta once we're done with hiking adventures around Medan?

There are two primary reasons to do the Sumatra trek: nature, and food.

Each part of Sumatra has their own local cuisine, and it can be worth visiting the cities just for that. Padang food is very famous, so I know several people who went to Padang just for food adventures alone.

Alternatively, there are natural things to see, like Lake Toba (very geologically interesting) or the canyons of Ngarai Sianok and Harau. These can be fun, but they're not exactly the best the country has to offer, and can be a challenge to get to. Interesting stops on a big road trip, maybe, but if you're tight on time, a lot of effort to get to.

You may also have other less common interests, like surfing the west coast, or the anthropologic exploration of the various tribes, including some really old groups who still live on the island.

Basically, figure out a map of what might interest you, and see if it's worth going there.

> How many days would you recommend devoting to just Jakarta as opposed to exploring the rest of Java?

The thing about Jakarta is it's not designed for visitors. That's the harsh reality. The city is an economic engine for the country, and is a big, jammed up, dusty city.

However, I actually think Jakarta is worth a night or two, especially in a few situations.

First, if you have any interest in Indonesian culture and history, then definitely visit. Check out the museums, see a couple monuments, hang out at Taman Mini.

Second, if you want to socialize, Indonesians are pretty open to visitors. My personal secret is to come on Sundays and chat with locals during the car-free morning. Or exercise in GBK or just walk around during afternoons.

Third, food. Jakarta is the melting pot of all Indonesian cultures, and there's a LOT to try. Explore some night markets, try restaurants, just hang out on google maps.

Fourth, shopping. It's not that Jakarta is great at shopping, but for local goods, it's a hub to find lots of stuff from around. Visit Sarinah for that. OR just run around in the malls. It can be fun for visitors just to acclimatize to Indonesia.

A few random side tips:

- Stay in the downtown core near an MRT or LRT station.
- Use said MRT, LRT, or KRL train networks to get around as much as possible. The bus network can also be good, but may be affected by traffic.
- Use google maps and grab/gojek apps or bluebird taxis if you need car access. Be aware that the city is a mixed bag in terms of sidewalks.
- Don't be afraid to ask for help if you get lost. The city is a maze. Locals ask for help all the time.
- Check out Bandung or Bogor nearby for a change of pace.

> How safe would this trip be for families with young children? Our friend group includes parents with a 2 year old that may decide to join.

Broadly safe. Be aware that Sumatran roads have a reputation at night, but statistically it's not very clear how real that is. 

Do beware of dusty roads and hot sun. 

> What is crucial information to know, or materials to pack, in order to ensure a great time in Indonesia?

As tourists, you may draw attention. This is pretty much curiosity. Some people may try to engage in conversations or take photos. You don't have to oblige, but these people usually aren't trying to scam you or something.

Follow the crowds to find good eating.

Indonesians dress relatively conservatively. You won't get in trouble for wearing shorts, but you might stand out.

Have cash on hand.

Try things out. That dodgy-looking satay stall that pops up at night might have the best damn beef of your life.

travel,1k1grau,mo1z1nf,"Jakarta is definitely not Istanbul! One to two days max. You're better off heading east towards Jogja. There's some nice hipster cafes and stuff these days, but I don't think it's going to be a trip highlight.

For what it's worth I'm Australian but I've lived in Turkey and spent years travelling throughout SE Asia. I'm also mum to a three year old. I've thought about going back to certain places, but Indo is pretty tough going for a toddler. Outside of Bali and parts of Java, Indonesia gets very rural, very quickly. If you're expecting Turkish levels of infrastructure, safety, hygiene etc you're going to be sorely disappointed! It's an amazing place and loads of fun but with a bub you have to consider safe food options, water, access to medicines etc... all of which are much harder to come by (if not impossible) in the sticks. The thought of being on a dodgy Indo chicken bus with food poisoning and a sick child is terrifying.

Even in touristic places like Mt Bromo you'll have trouble finding hot showers, comfy beds and quality food options. Cities like Jakarta and Jogja are no problem but rural areas are a little more challenging. Not impossible, but it's not really a ""beginner"" destination.

In terms of standards of accommodation, food hygiene, medical access, transport safety etc I'd say Thailand is on par with Turkey, but Indonesia still has some way to go.

(Edit: I just saw that you think that Hoi An is too touristy.  I'm not sure why you think that, but yes,  tourists certainly go there, and with good reason.  However, it's not overcrowded or anything like that.  Travelling in Asia is not what it was, it's not completely unspoiled, but some places are better or worse than others.

If you want to travel to smaller towns and the countryside without a car then western europe will be easier to get around but if you are constrained by your budget then eastern/south eastern europe will be the better option although travelling around will be harder without a car. 

In Germany smaller towns and villages are usually more beautiful and more historically preserved. Germany also has the Deutschlandticket which costs just 58€ for a calendar month and is valid in the whole country. You can take every bus/regional train/tram/subway/light rail in the entire country with this ticket. Basically every train except for long distance IC/ICE is included in the ticket and the public transit network is reasonably dense in Germany. You could pick a region and explore or go north to south or east to west with some stops throughout the country. Germany also has loooots of beautiful palaces and medieval castles to see. Hotels in smaller cities should also be cheaper and transit costs within Germany would only be 58€ so you could turn this pretty budget friendly.

Switzerland has the best public transport network in Europe but is also 50-100% more expensive than any other country in europe. The nature is really beautiful and wherever you want to go you can pretty easily reach.

Austria is cheaper than Switzerland with similarly stunning nature. It is still on the pricier side compared to other european countries but not nearly as extreme as Switzerland.

Spain and Portugal are also really nice. They are on the cheaper side, the sea is not that far and the cities there are really beautiful.

Karakoy is gonna be pricier but still a great option if you wanna be in the middle of it all. Demonstrations popped up everywhere (I was there last week) but it's really nothing to trouble yourself with just walk the other direction if you run into one. I saw like 3 pockets of it in multiple areas when I was there last week but nothing crazy popping off, and Taksim itself is kinda away from anywhere in Karakoy you wanna be. It wasn't even a hot spot per se.

Kadikoy is kind of a pain in the ass to transit late at night but it'll also have everything you're looking for and the vibes have been good. Uber is honestly a decent option, it'll just call a taxi anyway but at least you can dispute and or contact Uber if the charge ends up wrong.

travel,1jytnia,mn2b7qe,"If you're comfortable with driving, I'd recommend sticking with your initial plan to rent a car. The ruins get very busy, so it's good to have the option to visit in the early morning before the tours start arriving. A car also gives you the option of staying on a quieter part of the coast (we were happy with Akumal), but still dip into Tulum or Playa del Carmen. Our experience with driving was fine: good roads, reasonable traffic, never got stopped by the police.


As for the ruins, Chichén Itzá is the big one, and you'll want to stay a night in Valladolid to get there first thing in the morning. Uxmal and the Ruta Puuc sites (Labná was a favourite of ours) are also wonderful to visit from Mérida, if you have the time. Coba is perhaps less impressive, but its forest setting is beautiful, especially if you go first thing in the morning.

travel,1jyf0n1,mn3gp9r,"As someone who has been to PR several times, I feel like Vieques and Culebra are a *little* overhyped and a bit of a pain to get to for what people are expecting vs reality (meaning there are some fantastic beaches and things to do that don't require a ferry/flight to get to).  These aren't super glamorous resort/nightclub islands, they are ""rent a golf cart and find some secret beaches"" islands.  

Puerto Rico is VERY chill and rustic outside of San Juan.  The entire island is filled with hidden beaches you could sit and enjoy without a lot of other people nearby for hours.  It's not a ""rent an umbrella"" type of place.  San Juan would be the exception, where a lot of beach front is operated/owned by hotels that are set up along the beaches in Carolina.  So really, perhaps that's a better option for you if that's what you're looking for?  Would also be closer to the action for nightlife.  But I often say if you don't leave San Juan when visiting PR, you might as well have stayed in Miami.

I like Rincon personally.  The food there is some of the best on the island, and the beaches are calmer/more swimmable compared to the choppier east side.  There are also some decent VRBOs in that area within walking distance to a beach.  It's just a bit of a drive to get to, 2-3 hours by car from San Juan.  Some people hate that idea, but honestly it's the perfect mix of ""cute downtown"" and ""remote country"" that is very Puerto Rican in my mind.  Also has a cool ""surfer vibe"" as north along that coast has some killer waves that attracts all sorts of water sports fans.  

Otherwise I would recommend Luquillo on the other side.  I personally don't like the food as much, but you can get nice VRBO apartments in a place called Playa Azul with beautiful views and is on a public beach that feels empty majority of the day in the off season.  It's also close to hiking/the rainforest and is closer to San Juan for fast day trips in.  The famous Luquillo kiosks are also where the nightlife happens, and would be a fun place to enjoy an evening or two.  You would also be close to the ferry to Culebra/Vieques ferries if you still wanted to head there for a day trip.

If you are a US resident then you would insure your trip before your departure, not when you have already travelled and are already on your trip, hence the cancellation benefit would only apply before or on the day of your trip. Cancel for any reason is to be used up to 2 days PRIOR to the start of your trip and AXA pays up to 75% of your non cancellable Non refundable trip costs!

In order to receive a waiver for pre-existing medical conditions travel insurance companies require that you purchase a policy within a time sensitive window of your initial payment on your trip and that you insure the costs of your trip that are subject to cancellation penalties. AXA Assistance USA Travel Insurance provides a 14day window to receive a PMH waiver.

For travel plans offered with a wide range of travel benefits, you can visit their website. I hope this helps in choosing a good travel insurance company.",1,2025-04-23 20:52:02,TravelAdventure717

travel,1jwl73n,mmj6rti,"Hello, sorry to hear about your condition. As a Serbian, I can confirm that even though Belgrade is stunning, it's definitely not wheelchair friendly.

As far as wheelchair friendly cities in Serbia go, I'd personally only consider the northern part of Serbia and cities like Subotica. It's a historically rich city with plenty of things to see and do. Feels like a nice combination of Hungary and Serbia at one place(mostly cos it was a part of the Austrahungariam empire).

There's a few other cities which could be friendly such as Sombor, but I don't think it's worth the visit.

I'd suggest you looking out for Subotica, but id you're looking for Slavic culture and tradition, you probably won't find that there either.

travel,1jwl73n,mmjpfhs,"Am sure there are airbnb (or even hotel) options in the centres so you have not to rely on public transport 


Belgrade has sidewalks, the centre of Skopje is flat and so on",2,2025-04-11 11:44:29,relaksirano
travel,1jwl73n,mmk09bc,"Most of the Balkans are sadly not accessible. Many of the cities are located on or around hills which are quite steep. Public transport will also not be accessible. Old vehicles or car friendly planning usually means that there is a step or gap you have to cross in order to get on a transit vehicle. Car friendly city planning also means lots of parking on sidewalks and narrow sidewalks to begin with. Businesses also don't usually have ramps, especially if the building it is located in is older.

Your best bet will be flat cities where you won't be reliant on public transport. I agree with the other commenter, northern Serbia fits this quite well. Subotica or Novi Sad are pretty flat and small enough where you don't really need to take a bus. 

In Bosnia and Hercegovina cities are usually hilly or have really poor public transport so bad luck there. 

The city center of Belgrade is also ok and public transit there is free at least but lots of trams and buses require a step to get in. New Belgrade across the Sava river is also flat and the large boulevards also have large sidewalks attached to them but the area is not that beautiful and you will have to use public transport to get to the center. The streets from the center to the river are also quite steep, so public transport will once again be required. There is a big push for new vehicles currently as preparation for the EXPO 2027 but these might not be on every line yet and they don't always stop flush with the sidewalk.

Sarajevo is famous for being hilly and I doubt that the transit vehicle situation there is a lot better than in Belgrade. If you stay in the city center it should be fine but the hills start early and there won't be a lot of city left for you to comfortably reach.

Banja Luka I believe does not have public transport. It has some privately operated bus lines but not much more than that. The center is fairly flat but it is not that large and accessibility will probably be pretty poor for businesses. You will also be stuck as public transport either doesn't exist or is so poor that it is not worth using.",2,2025-04-11 12:56:24,EmbarrassedBadger922

Chichen Itza is great, but I preferred Uxmal and Coba (if you go that far south)....because they're less manicured. But it's still good to see to compare. 

Cenotes: Cenote Saamal is a good addition to what you have. I'd also recommend asking about smaller ones when you get to your hotels.

It sounds like Black Canyon and Glenwood Springs are your top destinations, so I'd base your itinerary around those. 

Skip the first few days of your itinerary by taking Highway 285 straight to Black Canyon (about a five hour drive). Spend 2 days there, then drive through Paonia to Highway 133 to Glenwood Springs. The scenery here is gorgeous. OR you could go to Aspen/Snowmass and see the Maroon Bells, the most photographed mountains in the state. Stay in the area for 2-3 days, then visit Glenwood. 

You could also go through Grand Junction and Palisade after Black Canyon on your way to Glenwood instead of going up 133. Colorado National Monument is beautiful in the spring if you like red sandstone desert environments. Palisade has a fruit and wine trail that's fun. There's kayaking on the Gunnison and CO rivers here too. 

Keep in mind that hiking trails in the high country will still have snow and mud on them. If you're planning long high altitude hikes, bring ice trekkers. The weather can change from sun to snow and back to sun in an hour. 

Also, eat at Sal Mex restaurant in Glenwood Springs, it's a bit away from the downtown area but the food is absolutely incredible.

travel,1jtqrak,mog7wk9,"I can help with this honeymoon dilemma! Having experienced both destinations, they offer completely different vibes after Langkawi.

Your wife's concern about Bali being boring after Langkawi isn't something I'd worry about. Bali offers a totally different experience - Langkawi is more about resort relaxation and beaches, while Bali has incredible cultural experiences, beautiful rice terraces, temples, and a variety of landscapes from volcanic mountains to beaches. The food scenes and cultural elements are completely different.

Your husband's point about Singapore being expensive is valid - it's definitely pricier than both Langkawi and Bali. However, Singapore offers amazing urban experiences, world-class attractions (Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay Sands), incredible food options from hawker centers to fine dining, and excellent shopping.

For a 3N/4D extension on your honeymoon, I'd personally recommend Bali. With that timeframe, you could split your stay between Ubud (cultural heart, rice terraces) and a beach area like Seminyak or Uluwatu. I used Seek Sophie to plan parts of my Bali trip last year and it made things so much easier - they helped arrange a private driver who knew all the best spots and timing to avoid crowds.

Singapore is amazing but might feel rushed in just 3 days, and the contrast between laid-back Langkawi and fast-paced Singapore could be jarring for a honeymoon. Bali would give you more bang for your buck and provide memorable experiences without breaking the bank.

What kinds of activities do you both enjoy most? That might help make the final decision!",1,2025-04-22 15:58:07,prazeros

Once you're here, Aldi Talk is probably the best option for you, I'd probably get at least the Tarif M plan, which has a speed of 100mbit/s and is currently 14,99€ for 28 days.

travel,1jt3067,mluae6x,"Hey, I just spent 5 days at Shangri-La Rasa Sayang and it was fantastic. 

The resort is located about 35 minutes from the ""city"" of Penang, at Batu Ferringhi. Around there, there are plenty of restaurants, a hawker style centre which was great, Starbucks, restaurants on the beach etc. At Rasa Sayang, there were quite a few kids there, the pool is great. Good service by the pool as well. Breakfast was absolutely fantastic, lots of western options and great local options too. One thing I really liked was that all of the rooms at Rasa Sayang face the pool area, and had a balcony too. We stayed in the Garden Wing, whilst there is a Rasa Wring - that wing is better, but I don't think they allow kids. It has a more formal restaurant where you need to wear smart casual clothes, no resort wear, and the pool doesn't allow kids under 16. Now next to that resort, is the Golden Sands, which is also a Shangri-La property. It has a kids pool area with slides etc which looked really cool - and you could literally just walk up there and get in the pool as if you were a guest - they're all more or less connected to one another, so we liked that there was a huge area that we could take advantage of. 

The only downside of the Batu Ferringhi area is that the beach out the front of Shangri-La has eroded away unfortunately. So the area immediately at the front of the resort has no beach access, but about 200 metres down the path, you can get onto the beach. 

In the city itself, we spent maybe two days wandering around, trying different cafes and restaurants, photos and whatever else. We went to this place in Penang called the Upside Down Museum... my partner chose it and I was... a bit annoyed but we got in there and honestly, we had so much fun ... look it up, I think your kids will probably love it. As two adults, we actually laughed so much it was really cool, as a family I think it would be a fun experience.

There is no way I would stay 5 days in Shanghai, Shanghai may be a convenient entry/exit point, but personally absolutely don't understand the hype about it. If you ask me the best thing Shanghai has to offer is the train out in order to explore nearby cities and towns. Maybe a bit of an exaggeration, as a large city there is plenty to do/see, but it is probably my least favorite city in China. Not been to Zhangjiajie, but 5 days seems a bit long to me, as I understand it 2-3 days is recommended, but without doubt it is possible to fill 5 days. 

> Are we only seeing the touristy side of China? Any alternatives?

Yes, to me it looks like you only picked places hyped on social media. A good alternative would be to pick a limited area and to explore it a bit more 'in depth'. Though you certainly picked contrasting destinations, other than Zhangjiajie they are all cities and all hyped on social media. If you really want to experience contrasts then get out of the cities and visit also off beat places, smaller towns, rural areas etc. In the end what to see and do is highly subjective, but it is certainly not a trip as I would plan it.",2,2025-04-06 01:35:55,Ninja_bambi
travel,1js5n6u,mm0cc6l,"Spending 5 days in Shanghai means that you're not only visiting the touristy places. Here's my recommanded itinerary:

Day 1. the usual touristy stuff, the Bund, Nanjing East Road, and Yu Garden. Less toristy spot: the Rock Bund, and walk along side the Suzhou River adjacent to it. Make it to the North Bund if you have enough stamina, it has the best view of the skyline.

Day 2. less touristy stuff. Nanjing West Road, check out Jing-An temple, biggest apple store in Aisa, a huge soviet style palace, and biggest Starbucks in Asia. After that, you can go visiting the former French concession, walk from Anfu Road to Normandie Apartment, it's like the Roma/Condesa area of Shanghai

Day 3. water town day

Day 4. Visiting Pudong. First, the most touristy spot, Lujiazui. Then go to Pudong art museum if you're interested, it's adjacent to Huang Pu river, have some great view on the rooftop. After that, check out Shanghai Museum East, it's a newly opened building, they moved all the collections from the old building to here, the bronze artifacts are must see. If you've time, visit Expo culture park, it's so-called central park of Shanghai. After all these, have a dinner in Taikoo Li Qiantan, that mall has some nice vibes.

Day 5. Visiting Xuhui waterfront, it's located in the Southern part of the city. Just walk along the Huang Pu River, from Gate M west bund dream center to the Start Museum. That's where the local young people hang out in weekends, very chill part of the city. After that, maybe visit some spots you missed in previous days",1,2025-04-08 09:58:24,Significant-Way-9290
travel,1js5n6u,mm15fmd,"For ZJJ, five days would allow you to do everything the area has to offer: the park itself, Tianmenshan, Grand Canyon, Baofenghu, etc. Personally, I think ZJJ park is the best part: aim for three full days in the park (your ticket will be for four days anyway, but you can see it all in three). Possibly worth building in an extra day in case of poor weather. DM me if you want some recommendations for ZJJ park itself.",1,2025-04-08 13:33:02,Obamabananarama

travel,1js25rv,mlji4zj,"Honestly, there's lots more to see at Stirling Castle. I'd go there first then to Balmoral afterwards (depending where youre staying). You don't need to prebook, but if it's busy, then it's safest to book at the end of May, you should be okay. 

Scottish schools don't break up til beginning July but English schools will be off that week. If that's the one you really want to see, I'd book it. BTW, you don't need a guide to take you, unless you really want one. Look at their reviews, I'd the company reviews are good, I'd follow their advice. If it's not, book with a different company.

BTW, you know they're a good 2.5 hours drive away from each other, right? If you're genuinely interested, I'd recommend going on 2 separate days so you've got enough time.",3,2025-04-05 14:03:47,Fabulous_Cow_4550
