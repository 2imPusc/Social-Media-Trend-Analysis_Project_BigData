Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain

And you are young and life is long, and there is time to kill today

And then one day you find ten years have got behind you

No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking

Racing around to come up behind you again

Sun is the same, in a relative way, but you're older

It was REALLLY BAD. Worst audio of any concert I have ever been to. Honestly, if they let ticketholders stream a video with soundboard audio from the show, that would be awesome. Then I could actually enjoy the show I was expecting to see.

We were front row in the 300’s, about half of our row left halfway through the concert. Glancing about later, I’d say 15% of people up top seemed to have left early.

I’m no sound engineer, but playing half of the upper house speakers (every other set) would have likely been a huge help, since then any other playing would have been further off-axis (several DB drop) plus further away (loudness drops with square of distance) to greatly reduce the slurring. Also likely possible to just run 18db/octave low pass 60hz on the every other set if they thought wouldn’t be able to carry the bass. 

The question then becomes, are all the upper hanging house speakers one channel? Or are they configured as individual channels? If they are all indivudual, then it becomes a whole lot easier. Figure average distance of the each set aimed at a given section of the 300’s from the seats, figure distance from mains, do time alignment to match. Move down two sections and repeat so you have additional delay as you move away from the stage.

Other option would be to play vocals from every other set and guitar from alternate sets. Again, take advantage of the off-axis rolloff.

But if the whole set of house speakers acts as one channel and you can’t do anything with it, then perhaps they should have just run 60hz low pass to them and done what they could with the mains by the stage to carry the rest.

Again, Id LOVE to be able to watch a video of the concert with soundboard audio, It looked like they put on an incredible show. But this was likely my only chance to see them in my lifetime and it was ruined by horrible sound.",2,2025-04-14 02:11:55,Alieges

Also simply do what I do. Pay what it's worth to you. If it's too expensive or if there isn't room inside for everyone then it's OK not to go. 

If everyone thought like I did then marked up resale and face prices rising higher than inflation would never be possible. Sold out shows also crash on the secondary when people refuse to pay those prices.

Fewer than 10 people still had the strength/interest in seeing Murphy after NIN wrecked the place. (We wandered back in during Murphy’s sat and, just as quickly, wandered back out. The energy the room had just an hour ago was completely gone.)

Anyway, by the 3rd time we saw NIN, still touring PHM, they were headlining.

music,1k2oo0r,mnw0o8e,"Maybe not ""prefer"", bit I like the radio edit of Meat Loaf's ""I'd do Anything For Love"".


The original is one of my all time favourite songs, and it's a typical Steinmann production - 12 minutes long, full of bombastic operatic sections, slower pace sections, huge instrumental buildups etc.


The radio edit condenses it to about 3 minutes, and totally changes the tone of the song, removing nearly all the pace changes, so it flows like a fast pace pop song. I really like both versions, they're like totally different songs.",141,2025-04-19 06:38:12,fourleggedostrich

I remembered when I was in high school I snuck out of the house one night to see Elton perform live in Detroit. It was an unforgettable performance that helped me understand the transformative power of music. Seeing him perform when I was in high school changed the course of my life. I had always felt like an outsider growing up and watching him on stage helped me to understand that it was OK to be different, to stand out, to take the road less traveled by. In fact, it was essential.” 



>“Over the decades it hurt me to know that someone I admired so much shared his dislike of me publicly as an artist,” she considered. “I didn’t understand it. I was told Elton John was the musical guest on ‘SNL’ and I decided to go. I needed to go backstage and confront him . When I met him, the first thing out of his mouth was, ‘Forgive me,’ and the wall between us fell down. Forgiveness is a powerful tool.

music,1jo99qz,mkpyw24,"Ringo Starr is among the most scrutinized, fetishized, analyzed, and catechized people in history. Mark Leibovich spent about a year reporting on the former Beatles drummer—whom the world still needs. [https://theatln.tc/dYWUgEqA](https://theatln.tc/dYWUgEqA)

When Leibovich met Starr, now age 84, he had a new record to promote—a solo record. “Starr looks remarkably well maintained for his age,” Leibovich continues. “He is also one of those rare figures whose face has been such a fixture of our cultural lives for so long that his actual, three-dimensional presence in front of you elicits a double take. Is this the genuine cargo or some wiry wisp of a Ringo impersonator?”

Decades after his Beatles days, Starr still considers himself a “band guy”: “I need a group of guys,” he told Leibovich. “I need the bass player and the guitar players.” Since 1989, Starr has been playing and touring with a revolving cast of old musical buddies in “Ringo Starr and His All Starr Band.” “I wondered why Starr was still subjecting himself to this grind,” Leibovich writes. “If nothing else, it illustrated how being a ‘band guy’ remains essential to his center of gravity.” Before a recent concert at the Venetian in Las Vegas, Starr pointed to the empty theater: “Tonight, this space will be all peace and love,” he vowed. 

“If the Beatles at Shea Stadium in ’65 was packed with shrieking teenage fans, the All Starrs at the Venetian incubated quite a different ambiance about six decades later,” Leibovich writes. But when the first chords of “Octopus’s Garden” twang out, “the crowd goes an aging version of nuts. Everyone sings along. I sense some earnest effort in the theater to make this gathering count for more than just nostalgia.”

music,1jyplhm,mn0tlsc,"It's not weird, it's just 2/4.  2/4 time is more common in folk music for a couple reasons:  often, this type of music lacks percussion - the 2/4 helps drive the music without percussion without it sounding hollow. 4/4 is more empty feeling.  When there's only 1 or 2 musicians (common in folk music), filling up melodic space is also necessary, so this music makes use of drone tones which work better in 2/4 because you can contrast the drone with the other melodic components on the up beats without it getting too complicated.  Violin and banjo folk are heavy on the drone tones.  The song above, he's droning with both the banjo and his voice in some parts with the rest of the melody being the other parts of the vocals.  

2/4 is also easy to divide up to do polyrythms over for things like vocals.  6/8 over 2/4 or 4/4 sounds beautiful.",13,2025-04-14 06:41:03,ChiAnndego

And you hear it in a lot of these old recordings - even up into the Carter Family if I remember right. They’re just untrained amateurs singing and playing what sounds cool to them, the way their parents and grandparents who taught them did. Many of the people making this kind of music were barely literate and almost certainly had no formal music training.

You know when you hear amateurs sing a capella and they rush through rests? It feels natural if you haven’t been trained since childhood to not do that. When kids learn to read music, there’s a *lot* of time spent clapping through rhythms and counting out loud before it becomes second nature. If you’ve never had that training, and neither have any of the people around you, and recorded music doesn’t really exist yet, you’re not going to absorb time signatures through the ether.

music,1joc2df,mkqzggq,"What's best about Metallica is that they're been producing albums and backing them up with three hours live shows for decades. There's enough material per era to have a huge group of fans. That's pretty special.


I discovered them with their release of *Master of Puppets* then dove heavily into their back catalog, open me up to a lot of other bands from the same area/era. 


Was gob smacked by the death of Cliff. Eagerly awaited with wonder how they would move on. *Garage Days Revisited* introduced us to Jason.
*Justice for All...* Releases with epic eight minute songs. Incredible.


By the time the *Black* Album came out my tastes were a bit different, they were shifting. 
I saw them in that tour at the Oakland Arena and it was amazing. 


I kinda jumped off the Metallica wagon as they worked through new material (and their issues).


And here they are still, doing it for what feels like forever and they really do have something for everyone.


I hope they never really do a farewell tour and just one day say, were all done, thanks for the ride.  \m/",99,2025-03-31 20:48:30,citizenjones

Let me tell you, after starting from his debut album, putting on Highway 61 Revisited was mind blowing. Like a Rolling Stone was a whole new song even though I'd heard it many times before. What a rush that must have been for Dylan fans hearing it for the first time in the 60s.

And the crazy thing is that it was his sixth album in just over 3 years!

Portishead is sample-based, and arose from the ashes of Breakbeat Hardcore. Member Geoff Barrow started out as a DJ in Bristol’s underground rave scene. They completely changed the game by having live jam sessions, pressing them to wax, and sampling themselves, on top of sampling other hip-hop, rave, and rock artists to boot. This technique was used very purposefully to save money on sample clearance, and also to avoid sounding like 90s American and British alt-rock. They were very intentional in this decision, and labeling them as “alt-rock” disregards this history. 

They go toe-to-toe with Tricky and Massive Attack. Dummy is widely regarded as the greatest trop hop album of all time. “Roads” isn’t just a trip hop track. It’s a defining trip hop track.",14,2025-03-25 06:52:17,brienoconan

Got those swollen hand blues

I've got amazing powers of observation

On the telephone to you
There'll be nobody home

And the inevitable pinhole burns
All down the front of my favourite satin shirt

I've got nicotine stains on my fingers
I've got a silver spoon on a chain
I've got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains

I've got wild staring eyes
And I've got a strong urge to fly
But I've got nowhere to fly to

All standing? Wear some comfortable shoes. Best thing about all standing shows is you can move around.

Getting some quality earplugs is a good idea, especially if you plan to go to concerts more regularly in the future. I defintiely regret not using them sooner on the days where the tinnitus and muffled hearing is bad.

Edit: Don't feel as if you NEED to go with someone because the whole point of going is because YOU want to go and see the people on the stage.

music,1jk530u,mjsodsn,"Hey there:

When I was younger, I was in a position very similar to the one you're now in. I was either 17 or close to that age, and went to see Fall Out Boy in their heyday. No one I knew could/wanted to go, so I went by myself.

Personally, I barely remember the concert. It was really overwhelming to be surrounded by so many people. It was hard for me to just enjoy the show, because it was just too much for me to be in a crowd that big (1000+, give or take), and I really would have preferred to just have more room to breathe, watch, listen and enjoy the show without the vast swathes of sweaty bodies all around me that reeked of beer and pot. Whether or not I had anyone to go with probably wouldn't have changed that, honestly.

As I got older, I went to more and more shows - they rarely felt comfortable, despite eventually becoming someone who would crowdsurf and mosh all the time. In hindsight, I wish I'd been self-aware enough to realize how uncomfortable it all made me. I do have some great stories from some of those shows, but I often wonder about whether or not it was worth making myself so uncomfortable to go see these shows I can only remember little bits and pieces of, even when I did go with friends.

Anyway, back to you: Should you go? You could certainly give it a shot - I think it might be worthwhile to discover whether you enjoy that kind of setting or not. And simultaneously, if you discover you aren't really comfortable in crowds, that is absolutely okay, too. I know I'm certainly not one for concerts anymore (at least ones that I'm not performing at - I play in a couple of bands, and love being onstage), but I have tons of friends who love going to them, and I'm sure many people here will speak to the incredible times they've had at live shows.

Lastly - I think other people in the thread have said it already, but if you feel unsafe or uncomfortable at any time, it's definitely okay to go out and get some fresh air (don't forget to hang onto some proof of purchase, though - definitely don't want to get stuck out there). Depending on the show/venue, the bathrooms can be quite packed, so going there for a breather might prove to be difficult. And hanging out at the back of the venue can help you not feel too swarmed - depending on how tall you are, you may have trouble seeing, though, so try to find a good spot before the show starts!

If you decide to go, I hope you have a great time! And if not, we live in an age where thankfully, you can watch live videos of just about any band via YouTube - it's obviously a very different experience, but it's a completely viable alternative to a live show if you're not into those.

Stay safe and have fun!",8,2025-03-26 07:12:44,ZXSth

This is, obviously, not an exhaustive list so let me know who you are seeing an I might be able to help.",15,2025-03-26 06:10:31,Martipar
music,1jk530u,mjsy9c3,"17-18 is when I started goin to shows alone. You'll be fine. For Standing Room Only, stand literally anywhere that's not the center of the floor, or be ready to get shoved a bit if a mosh pit breaks out. As long as you chill off to the side or in the back you'll be good!

If you do end up in the mosh, don't worry! The moshers are usually the nicest people in the spot! Just kind of bounce off of people till u get to the side and slide out. Pretty easy. If you fall, put your hands out to the side and someone will grab you and pick you up

Don't take a drink if someone offers it to you, 1: you'll get kicked out by venue staff since you're underage, and 2: you don't know what they did with that drink. In fact, don't consume anything given to you by anyone who isn't behind a bar, and if what they give to you leaves your sight, it's not yours anymore 

I'm not sure if people crowdsurf to the warning, but if you do end up at the front, keep an eye behind you and be ready to catch people and move em forward towards the front. That's rlly all u need to know tbh.

I had a blast and left the venue with a big smile. Not a single person made me feel uncomfortable, they made me feel like part of a huge family

Apparently there are houses all over the country where you can play music for your stay. And any merch you sell helps you move on to the next house. There are one specifically for folk music. There are also ones for punk music but they're not really always the nicest places. The bluegrass ones tend to be out in the country.

His wife didn't want them and just wanted the money or to give them to friends. We went through each album and pulled the ones that seemed worth something and in good shape. We sold a few early Beatles for $30 or so on eBay. There was some old BB King that actually went for $100. The rest we sold in bulk at an estate sale. Maybe $2 each.
