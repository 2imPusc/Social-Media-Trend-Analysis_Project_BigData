SACRAMENTO — A teenager who killed his friend while they were playing with a gun at a south Sacramento home over the weekend has been arrested, authorities said Tuesday:

>The Sacramento County Sheriff's Office said it happened Sunday afternoon at a home on Chriswoods Court. 

>Several minors were located at the home during the time of the incident, but authorities said the alleged shooter was a male teen and the victim was a female teen, both 16.

>Investigators learned that the male teen had brought the gun to the home. After they had been playing with the gun, the male teen had shot the female teen in the head and left the scene with the firearm before law enforcement arrived, the sheriff's office said.

>The girl was declared dead at the scene by first responders.

>Authorities said several other minors were detained when law enforcement arrived, as the circumstances of the shooting were still under investigation.

>It was Tuesday morning in Stockton when law enforcement officials located and arrested the alleged shooter. He was booked into the Sacramento County Juvenile Hall on a murder charge, the sheriff's office said.

>Prior to his arrest, investigators said it was revealed the teen had three outstanding felony warrants and had a history of arrests for weapons violations and sex crimes.

>Neither of the involved individuals was identified.",442,2025-04-02 17:09:25,Doodlebug510

It would be polite to call it a total mess.

news,1jqmc41,ml7z37l,">This incident comes after sea lions on the California coast have reportedly been displaying strange behavior, likely due to a harmful algae bloom impacting the region, according to marine researchers.

[Early Bloom of Toxic Algae off Southern California Sickens Hundreds of Sea Lions and Dolphins](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/feature-story/early-bloom-toxic-algae-southern-california-sickens-hundreds-sea-lions-and-dolphins)

*The culprit in the strandings is domoic acid, a neurotoxin produced by the harmful algae Pseudo-nitzschia that can multiply quickly in the right conditions. Wind-driven upwelling of deep ocean water provides nutrients that fuel California’s rich marine ecosystem. That same upwelling can also feed rapid growth of the algae and the toxin it produces.*

news,1k4norc,mobdkkj,"A jury found Nadine Menendez guilty on all counts in a bribery case in which prosecutors said she was a “critical participant” in the five-year fraud with her husband, former U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez, as they accepted cash, gold bars and a luxury car from three New Jersey men looking for help with business dealings or legal woes.

The jury began considering the charges against the 58-year-old on Friday in Manhattan federal court. They returned the guilty verdict late Monday afternoon on all 15 counts she faced, including bribery, conspiracy, obstruction of justice, working as a foreign agent and more.

Menendez, wearing a pink facemask, stood beside her defense attorney as the verdict was read following the three-week trial. Sentencing was scheduled for June 12.

She was found guilty in the same federal courthouse in Manhattan where a different jury convicted her husband of many of the same charges in 2024. He was not in the courthouse for Monday's guilty verdict.

Her husband, the 71-year-old former senator, is set to report to prison in June to begin an 11-year sentence. He stepped down from his Senate post after his conviction. Repeatedly during the trial, prosecutors said Bob and Nadine Menendez were “partners in crime,"" detailing the timeline of the whirlwind romance between the couple that began in early 2018 and continued after criminal charges were brought against them in Sept. 2023.

news,1jl7o22,mk2b3c7,"When I was in 8th grade I stumbled on a book that depicted actual sexual relationships between high-school age teenagers in the library at school - nothing actually pornagraphic, it just discussed teenage sexuality as it was. There was an instance at a camp, another at a party, I forget. I've actually tried finding the book as an adult and I've never been able to. It had won an award even but that never helped me.

This book also had characters that were questioning their sexuality, in a very adolescent ways and exploratory sense - all of this wasn't the story itself, much like in real life, diacovering sexuality is just one of the things that happens during adolescence and high-school. 

In 8th grade I was just beginning to notice how much I noticed the other the other boys and how little I noticed the girls...

That book was the first book I had ever read that presented my experience alongside the ""normal experience"" as if it was the same. It was one of the only examples in my childhood of a gay high-schooler. He was dealing with some of same shit I was - I think my experience, especially where I grew up, would have been harder had I not read that book. It reassured me that I was normal, just uncommon.

These parents believe their protecting their children from the evils of the world. That book didn't make me gay tho, I was always gay. Teenagers don't need sexually explicit content to be sexual - evolution will take care of that all on its own.

It takes seconds to fill up your tank or grab a snack from the local shop, but that quick stop could cost you dearly if a credit card skimmer is lurking nearby. In the Pittsburgh area, these sneaky devices are showing up more and more, blending in so perfectly with the real machines that even the sharpest eyes might miss them.

Criminals are getting bolder, popping skimmers onto cash machines and card readers at petrol stations and convenience stores with the kind of ease that would make a magician jealous. One such case in West Mifflin, just outside Pittsburgh, has police scratching their heads and combing through hours of CCTV in the hope of catching whoever planted a skimmer at a 7-Eleven on Camp Hollow Road. The image of the dodgy device soon did the rounds on social media, raising eyebrows and awareness in equal measure.

Police Chief Gregory McCulloch says it is often ordinary people who sound the alarm. A customer might notice something that doesn’t feel quite right with a card reader or later spot an unfamiliar charge on their statement. From there, it becomes a painstaking job for detectives, especially since many of the culprits are not local. These crooks often use Bluetooth to gather the stolen data, never even setting foot inside the shop again. They just park nearby and collect the loot wirelessly.

The FBI reckons these skimming scams cost banks and consumers over a billion dollars a year, and part of the problem is how difficult they are to spot. According to Chief McCulloch, your hands are your best defence. Forget looking, it is all about feeling. If something seems loose or out of place, give it a good tug. In one case, a suspicious shopper did just that and the fake device came right off. Simple as that.

These skimmers are clever little things. They slide over the existing card slot and have a tiny computer chip inside that grabs all your information the moment you swipe. Just like that, your bank details are in the hands of someone who has no business knowing them.

McCulloch recommends remembering three little words: tug, tap and track. Tug at the card reader before you use it. Tap to pay whenever you can, since using contactless helps you steer clear of dodgy readers altogether. And track your bank statements like a hawk. The sooner you spot a charge you didn’t make, the better your chances of shutting it down before the damage piles up.

As technology gets smarter, so do the criminals. But a bit of caution, a quick check, and a habit of keeping an eye on your accounts can go a long way. Because while these skimmers might be hard to see, the trouble they cause is crystal clear.",63,2025-03-25 01:52:31,TheSleepingPoet

In 1982-83, I was in sixth grade, aged 11-12.  The science class I had that year was heavily focused on geology.  Two things that I learned about talc that year were that (a) it's what baby powder is made from and (b) it's often contaminated with asbestos.  


At age 12, in 1983, from paying attention to my sixth grade science class, I understood the hazard that baby powder represented.

news,1jp6wvf,mkxvje0,"This has been one of those interesting cases where science points one way and the courts (and public opinion) have run the other. There's a number of reasons that courts can diverge from scientific consensus, but what I find really curious is how the bias against the weight of evidence is also over represented in Internet searches and AI responses.

You'd think that given a company with resources like J&J they would be more effective of getting their narrative out but you have to get pretty deep into a search engine to find critical analysis of the talc claims. And it would be one thing if the critical analysis were coming from small organizations or orgaorg without much prestigious, but that's not the case. 

the American Cancer Society (ACS) states that research on talc and ovarian cancer “have been mixed, with some studies reporting a slightly increased risk and some reporting no increase … For any individual woman, if there is an increased risk, the overall increase is likely to be very small.”

The NCI concludes that “the weight of evidence does not support an association between perineal talc exposure and an increased risk of ovarian cancer.”

So you've got two major cancer based orgs stating that the evidence is either weak or absent, and yet their messages are not ones you'd come across readily with a quick search asking about the evidence. 

It's probably because this topic is on the more nuanced end of the spectrum where you have to really look at how to weigh different studies in determining whether there's a cause and effect connection, and it's one most of us just don't have the skill sets to interpret correctly",5,2025-04-01 23:34:08,Spiritual_Paper_1974

Basically: the school board just needed better lawyers when crafting the policy.  The school board originally stated that Black Lives Matter posters were not allowed under their policy forbidding “conduct that is intended to or reasonably could be perceived as endorsing or opposing specific political issues or political candidates”.

Later on, the district made a series of Black Lives Matter posters that teachers could *choose to display*.  This created a “limited public forum”, since they were no longer adhering to their stated policy.  If the government creates a limited public forum then they can’t discriminate on the basis of view point, which means that they would have to allow all / blue lives matter posters as well.

news,1jpw5cz,ml2h2l2,"Twenty workers at a Philadelphia-area charter school were charged in connection with allegations of abuse of young children and failure to report it, prosecutors announced Monday.

The Chester Township Police Department said in court documents that security video captured roughly 100 incidents at Chester Community Charter School’s West Campus in November and December involving what the district attorney’s office said are 26 victims.

The victims, in grades K-5, were members of the school’s emotional support program, the office of Delaware County District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer said in a statement. Some of them were as young as 5 years old, the DA’s office said.

Stollsteimer said at a news conference Monday that he watched security video of the alleged abuse.

“There are nine individuals who have surveillance video that I’ve watched putting their hands on children, some as young as 5,” Stollsteimer said. “Oftentimes, you can see them using their knee to take a child to the ground.”

Stollsteimer said formal charges were filed Monday morning. 

Police filed initial charges in state court March 25 after family members of two students separately raised concerns to the school on Jan. 9 and Jan. 10, according to court documents. 

An unnamed parent said their 7-year-old son was afraid to go to school because two staffers had used physical holds on children in a “positive support room” on campus, part of a program at the school called Team Approach to Achieving Academic Success, according to a police affidavit filed in support of charges.

Relatives of another 7-year-old boy stepped forward the next day with similar complaints, the affidavit said. 

Investigators said they found consistent accounts that staffers used “shoulder work” — including pinching pressure points on the neck, placing children in holds with their arms crossed in front of them and pushing knees into students’ backs — as a way of gaining physical compliance, the affidavit said.

Nine defendants alleged to have abused or had physical contact with children were charged with conspiracy, simple assault, unlawful restraint, false imprisonment, endangering the welfare of a child and failure to report endangering the welfare of a child, the DA’s office said.

Eleven defendants were charged with failure to report the alleged endangerment. Three of those charged with failure to report are school employees and were placed on leave pending further investigation, the school said in a statement.

Both groups of defendants include people with multiple counts of each charge. Police indicated a “dean of students” and “teachers” were among the second group.

On its website, the school lists the dean of students as Dahkeem Williams. 

“We take great exception to the District Attorney’s statement that ‘all the adults charged are equally guilty in failing to protect these children,’” Williams’ attorney, who also represents another defendant in the case, told NBC Philadelphia.


None of those charged were in custody, but some have made arrangements to surrender, Stollsteimer’s office said in its statement.

Online court records did not list attorneys for most defendants. The public defender’s office for Delaware County did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday night.

“I am proud that today we are holding the support staff, teachers, and even a dean of students accountable for abusing or failing to report the abuse, of vulnerable children,” Chester Township Police Chief Kenneth Coalson said in the DA’s statement.

Stollsteimer noted that state law mandates reporting child abuse for those who work in school settings.

Individual incidents of using physical contact for compliance must each be reported under state regulations, and none were, according to the affidavit. 

“This is just unacceptable behavior to happen anywhere, but particularly in a school setting for children who are supposed to be getting emotional support,” Stollsteimer said.

The school parent-teacher association did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday night.

The contractor for whom the DA said most of the defendants work, Peak Performers Staffing LLC, did not respond to a request for comment. Chester Community Charter School said it severed ties with the company and its workers.

The school said in a statement that 17 of those charged work for Peak Performers, which it said took over a previous, “highly reputable” contractor’s emotional support work after that contractor discontinued the services the school was using.

The school said it was assured the Peak Performers employees were properly trained in physical contact with students but later learned they had not completed the necessary training.

The school characterized itself as an unnamed victim in the case, saying it was “duped” by Peak Performers.

“CCCS plans to pursue all appropriate legal recourse against Peak Performers for the reckless and dangerous manner in which it operated,” the school said. “CCCS leaders are outraged at the actions and inactions of Peak Performers and stands in solidarity with the other victims.” 

In 2018, Chester Community Charter School said it was the largest brick-and-mortar charter school in Pennsylvania. The K-8, four-campus school says it serves more than 4,000 students. Chester Township is about 22 miles southwest of Center City Philadelphia.",55,2025-04-02 18:42:20,Oatmeal-BaconGrease

2. Russian 'Cards' Kaput - Poor lil mistreated Putin won't be getting money from Russian oil revenue -- Uh oh - he'll lose his cards!
3. Arab Relations Kaput - Trump just made the rich Arabs he has been courting poorer.  That'll give them fewer reasons to accept any US trade route deal, and more reason to align with BRICS, 'Rusher', and 'Chiner'.
4. US Big Oil Donors Kaput - DRILLBABYDRILL Big Oil contributed over half a billion to Trump's campaign to get his allegiance on exploiting all the 'liquid gold under our feet'.  Guess what fellas it's just CHEAP dirty OIL again, get in line.

So much for demonizing clean energy.  So much for pushing for AI & Crypto data centers powered by corrupt Big Oil, fracking, etc.  Big OPEC players are back in the game, thanks to Trump's factory-killing tariffs.  Cheap crude is back.

news,1k0o62v,mnfhq1k,"ARTICLE:

The European Union on Wednesday published a list of seven countries that it considers “safe,” as member states seek to speed up migrant returns.

The list includes Kosovo, Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, India, Morocco and Tunisia.

WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR ASYLUM CLAIMS?

The expanded list means EU member states will process applications from the countries deemed safe using an accelerated procedure because they have a low chance of success.

“Many member states are facing a significant backlog of asylum applications, so anything we can do now to support faster asylum decisions is essential,” said Magnus Brunner, the EU’s commissioner for migration.

Although the EU presented a similar list in 2015, the plan was abandoned due to heated debates over whether or not to include Turkey.

WHY IS THE CHANGE BEING MADE NOW?

Brussels is under mounting pressure to crack down on irregular arrivals and ramp up deportations, as hard-right parties ride a wave of anti-migrant sentiment across Europe.

Hawks including Sweden, Italy, Denmark and the Netherlands in October demanded fast-tracked legislation to boost returns — and urged the Commission to act swiftly.

Italian Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi said the change “constitutes a success for the Italian government, which has always worked both at a bilateral and multilateral level to obtain the revision of the regulation.”",43,2025-04-16 16:08:22,OutrageousCost4818

""Two Service Members Lives Wasted on Needless Political Spectacle""

  
Accidents happen. Accidents happen all too often when you place young men & women in situations where they are tasked with operating heavy equipment and machinery while overburdened, fatigued, in austere conditions. A military life is not always a safe life. They weren't drafted, they volunteered, but that's no reason to exploit their commitment to service by placing them in an environment that makes accidents like this more likely. 

Make no mistake, the entire Border mission is a political show to appease the current administration. The US Army is not trained to conduct these operations, nor is it part of their roles as defined in current military doctrine. Border security is the responsibility of Customs and Border Patrol - something this government continues to fail to remember. If CBP is unable to perform their duties, it should NOT fall upon the Armed Forces to pick up their slack. A Stryker (like the one depicted in the photo attached to this article) is overkill and wasteful for the role assigned, which would be under normal circumstances be performed by a CBP officer in a CBP Ford Expedition or similar SUV. Which perfectly encapsulates the overwrought optics of this whole sideshow.

Two Americans died, needlessly, in a situation they should never have been in. Contact your Representatives.

>Although the first US reference to panini dates to 1956, and a precursor appeared in a 16th-century Italian cookbook, the sandwiches became trendy in Milanese bars, called paninoteche, in the 1970s and 1980s. Trendy US restaurants began selling panini, with distinctive variations appearing in various cities.

>During the 1980s, the term paninaro arose in Italy to denote a member of a youth culture represented by patrons of sandwich bars, such as Milan's Al Panino, and Italy's first US-style fast food restaurants. Paninari were depicted as right-leaning, fashion-fixated individuals, delighting in showcasing early-1980s consumer goods as status symbols.
