gaming,1jvlpgc,New York in Division franchise is probably my favorite setting in any video game.,"The entire point of this post is just how realistic the world looks like. You can absolutely imagine that the situation the World of Division is facing is real (massive civil unrest after an extremely dead virus made in a lab got released).

In the first game you have almost war-torn snowy Midtown NYC in Christmas decorations and in Division 2 DLC Warlords of New York you have the same war-torn Lower Manhattan just weeks after one of the worst hurricanes in human history to the point that it tore through Brooklyn bridge and beached an oil tanker. Also the game has LOTS of loot crates and crafting materials suitcases hidden in the world so exploring is really worthwhile. Almost every side alley is fully explorable, sometimes you'll find yellow switches that will unlock the buildings with even more shit to loot. 

I'm not even from USA nor have ever visited. I'm currently playing Division 2 and for the last couple of months it has been my most played game. I put some 100 hrs in Division 1 but that was in 2022 way past it's prime.

gaming,1jnoqh8,Rebel Galaxy Outlaw is a modern Privateer,"One of my favorite space flight games as a kid was Wrong Commander: Privateer - it had all the great space combat of a Wing Commander game, plus the addition of a semi-open world where you weren't locked into a totally linear storyline. I recently saw Rebel Galaxy Outlaw on sale for like $4 in the PlayStation store and it looked interesting, so I bought it. While I'm not very far in the main story, it's definitely not just a spiritual successor to Privateer, it clearly has been influenced by it. Examples: 

* You start with a junk freighter that barely can do anything, and have to work your way up to buying better do you can pieces the game. 
* There's a space patrol that will randomly check you for contraband (which you can either buy in shadier space ports or pick up from blasting pirates. If they find anything, you have to fight them or flee.
* You can gain reputation with various factions, which can negatively affect your reputation with opposing factions. 
* Some of The random enemies you encounter seen to be religious zealots, a la the Church of Man in Privateer.
* There's mission boards your can get missions from to earn more credits. There's also both merchant's and mercenarie's guilds you can pay to join and get better missions from. 
* One of the companies you can get missions from is Lynch Industries, which is the same name as a major player in Privateer.
* The name of many of the weapons is the same and in the same order of power, most notably the most powerful gun being the tachyon cannon.

I'm sure there's more that I'll find as I go, but given how much I liked Privateer, I'm really liking this game and I figured I'd let people know in case that also have find memories of Privateer and want to try something similar.

One week ago I decided to actually play the DLC as I was holding into it because I don't like horror games,  and my god, what a marvelous piece of art, it did everything I liked about the base game and managed to make me feel things just as well, the extra bit of lore you get is just the Cherry on top of everything it does so well related to game-design, the ending of the DLC actually got some tear drops out of me, I used my old save to keep playing the DLC so I got the ""true"" ending cutscene as I had almost the entire ship-log unlocked, and that hit extra hard because it makes you remember details about the main story (that by itself, gets me sentimental by just thinking about it)

After this, I knew I had one last objective, that is to beat the game again because >!I rightfully guessed the prisoner would be there, just like Solanum!<, but before that I had the idea of getting all the achievements so I could get all the enjoyment out of this game, a couple of days ago I got the remaining two, and in the process of getting the achievements I revisited some spots from the story and that worked as some sort of ""replay"" because even though I already had some achievements unlocked, I always sidetracked here and there just to read some of the dialog and get some of the details scattered around (and also to get the remaining log-entries for the achievement)

When I finally got the >!""Tubular""!< achievement (the only trophy I actually had trouble to get), I >!waited for the loop to end inside the dream world, just roaming around for no reason!<, and went straight to the objective, I still think about how genius the level design is for blocking important stuff with knowledge barriers, to the point you can beat the game in \~10 minutes if you know what to do, and as I started the last journey with my ship everything about the game started popping into my head, and the moment I reached the >!Vessel!< I was already losing my mind, the journey was reaching an end and the >!Owls!< weren't there to stop me, a funny bit of curiosity is that I could see the >!Signal blocker!< those bitches left in >!The Eye!<, it's still floating there like if nothing happened, good thing the >!Nomai outsmarted them!<

If reaching the end for the first time was like getting hit by a truck, this time around it was like a big ass train, having the >!prisoner talk about his sacrifice, and having him realize it was all worth it in the end!< was the last bit of satisfaction I needed

As the credits started rolling I completely lost it, I cried like a little baby and that goddamn song is now a permanent part of my brain, I doubt any other video game will make me cry like I did here, it felt so personal, I'm glad I decided to finish this game for good the way I did, the perfect ending for the perfect game

I know taste is a very personal thing, I've heard opinions about this game that don't make any sense to me, and even though some people just don't have that **spark** of curiosity that it requires, consider giving this game a try",111,0.7,61,2025-03-28 23:15:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1jm8j0d/outer_wilds_made_me_cry_for_the_first_time_in/,Marc_Vn

gaming,1jqmfe3,The most piratey guide to pirate games that has ever pirated in the history of piracy!,"***Disclaimer: This is about the genre of pirate games! It contains NO instructions regarding illegally obtaining games!***

***Link to the original guide:***

[***https://www.piratesahoy.net/threads/the-most-piratey-guide-to-pirate-games-that-has-ever-pirated-in-the-history-of-piracy.34594/***](https://www.piratesahoy.net/threads/the-most-piratey-guide-to-pirate-games-that-has-ever-pirated-in-the-history-of-piracy.34594/)

*Cover image created by our members and developers Hammie and Nomad. Used with their permission.*

Ahoy there!

We, the ladies and gentlemen of PiratesAhoy!, a community focused on pirate games, have banded together to create a comprehensive guide to games set in the Age of Sail. It was made to raise awareness that the genre is more alive than ever, and to provide a counterpoint to the ""Nobody makes good pirate games anymore""-narrative.

It was planned to post the entire guide right here, but it was too big for reddit, so the reddit-thread will be a very short version. It will still include the entire list, but without any detailed descriptions. If you want to read the whole thing, feel free to pay a visit to our site via the link - it will directly lead you to the guide in question. It's also recommended to save that to your bookmarks, since the reddit-thread won't be updated once it gets archived.

The original starts with quite a lot of rambling regarding the genre itself, so if you want to jump right to the list, just scroll down until you hit the big, bold text, which is also the title of this guide.

For your convenience, and to not make this list explode, it's limited to pirate games where you control a ship (in)directly that is integral to the gameplay instead of being mere fluff. It will also only list games set in the Age of Sail, otherwise, you would have to take tons of sci-fi games too.  
Not included are games that aren't playable in any form as of the time of writing, are abandoned in EA, frankly bad, nobody of us has played (yet), and have PlayWay as a publisher. They are notorious for clogging the stores with concepts, which are then developed depending on wishlists. Suffice it to say, their pirate games will never come to fruition.

If the games have optional multiplayer, are in Early Access, have demos available as of the time of writing, and/or are free to play, I will mark those with (MP), (EA), (D), and (F2P) respectively.

They are divided into categories, depending on whether you look for titles similar to Black Flag, Sea of Thieves, and such, and are all in alphabetical order.

Now, let's go!

gaming,1jqevl6,The Finals - A Game That Deserves So Much More (not sponsored),"This will be a fairly long read, so fair warning to everybody.

The Finals seems like the type of game that should absolutely blow up considering what it offers in the current state of the gaming industry riddled with greed and soulless games. A well-rounded F2P model with lots of free cosmetics, pretty generous free battlepass rewards, plenty of character customization, one of the best emotes and cosmetics I've ever seen in a game, a communicative dev team that actually cares about and listens to the community. Now, from the gameplay side of things it has some of the most satisfying gun play then any shooter game I've played, fluid movement, innovative gameplay (there is quite literally no game like it currently with the original Cashout mode format, dynamic destruction and crazy amounts of strategizing it opens up), a highly vaired meta and different gamemodes to choose from for casual and competitive players. 

I have been playing the game since Season 1 and I will sum up my experience throughout that time. From Season 1, the devs have been constantly figuring out what they want their game to be, balancing it out, figuring out all the small kinks, finding the identity of the game and gotta say, for the majority of that journey, it has been an addictively fun experience. Sure, as any game, it does have some flaws, but as I said previously, it is a game that truly innovated the shooter genre and what I hope shooter games become. Some of the more burning questions regarding the game are:

  
1. **What is the current situation with cheaters?** From my experience, encountering a cheater is very rare and due to how dynamic and unpredictable the game flow is, you can simply focus on sneakily stealing a cashout and ignore the gun fights to win. I'm not saying that you won't encounter them, you will, but personally, they are an insignificant factor when deciding to play the game or not. The anti-cheat is constantly being improved upon aswell.

2. **Server performance and stability, desync** \- This is something the game does struggle at times, but it is also something that is being actively worked on by the dev team, even moreso in this season specifically as a Major 100k Tournament is planned for later this year. Out of 10 games, I would say I get frustrated with server performance in maybe one or two instances (looking at you, dagger players stabbing me in the ""back""), overall the game performs no different if not better in some ways then other games considering how heavy the server load is. Bigger and more detailed maps like Kyoto take the biggest toll on the servers, but even then it's fine in most cases. Every other map runs smoothly from my experience.

3. **Regular updates and feedback** \- I cannot stress enough how communicative and committed Embark is when it comes to their game. They actively listen to feedback and balance the game accordingly and not just balance, fan ideas regarding cosmetics have also been implemented numerous times. They are dedicated to creating a truly fun experience, which is not surprising considering what the devs team background is, truly talented people. I never bought anything in game before The Finals, but this is one live-service game that deserves me spending 10€ on a battlepass that also pays for itself btw so no need to keep buying it.

4. **What is the average casual player experience like?** Take it from somebody that doesn't play shooter games all that religiously (I've played a little bit of Valorant for a short period and that's about it), the game can be extremely sweaty, but contrary to popular belief, I don't think the game is that unfriendly for new players. I've gotten a couple of my friends that are familiar with shooters like CoD to play and they are performing quite fine, they do still have to get used to map layouts and different things all the classes do, but all of that will come through practice just as with any game. It truly becomes a unique gaming experience once you get to know it and that is why I feel in love with the game. 

In short, The Finals is what the shooter genre has been waiting for, an innovative game with satisfying gunplay and movement and best of all - no greed. **What more could you ask for? Give it a try.**",84,0.61,111,2025-04-03 10:28:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1jqevl6/the_finals_a_game_that_deserves_so_much_more_not/,_B_R_A_N_E_

gaming,1jna7fg,"Thinking of a game name, and I confused myself into thinking it was something else.","So, back in the 90s pretty much when ps1 was released I remember playing(trying to at least) a game that I thought was 'Time Commando' except... Its not that. 

The reason I'm trying to remember is because I could not get past the literally first few screens. 

Somethings I remember :

It was 3rd person. 
I only managed to see like 3 different screens, and it was like a mystery type game where I had to collect stuff. (I think) 
Bright colours, nothing dark. 
I remember there being a wooden boat, like canoe style. 
Male character.

The screens were like, male char walk in a direction, into a different screen. And I remember going back and forth between the same 3 screens for days. Then I gave up. 

I was probably like 6-7? So my memory is super hazy and all of it could be wrong; but I'm hoping someone may be able to shed some light. 

I even went through an entire list of games on the Web, but could not find it. I swear it was something like time commando, but it's not that game. I understand this is not a lot of info, but thought I'd give this sub a bash. 

P.s it may well have been the Sega megadrive, but I swear it was ps1

Edit: the male char was a white slim human male, and I remember him maybe wearing blue? That last bit could be wrong though.

2nd edit: it is eerily similar to Ark of Time. Almost to a tee, but I just don't remember it like that. I'm not sure if this is some weird childhood memory issue that I've got. But man the scenes I can remember just not the screens from Ark of Time.

☑️ Xbox Series X is my main console, for their 1st party games (Sea of Thieves, Grounded, Forza Horizon 5, Halo, Gears, Crackdown, etc), all the 3rd party games, and Game Pass, which is amazing. Also, 4K Blu-rays.      

☑️ PS5 for their 1st party games and playing old PS1, PS2, and PS3 games via PS+. I love playing games like 'Marvel's Spider-Man' and 'Syphon Filter' on it.      

☑️ Switch for Nintendo's exclusives, obviously.       

☑️ Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold for mobile games and Google Play Pass. Also, Xbox cloud and console streaming. I still can't believe this phone has 16GB of RAM. Blows my mind.              

☑️ Meta Quest 3 for VR, obviously. Also, Xbox Game Pass via Cloud Gaming. 

☑️ My Windows 11 gaming PC because it's kind of a monster and it pairs very nicely with Xbox PC Game Pass. Also, Steam. I hope those next-gen Xbox rumors are true.                

☑️ Google Stadia controller because RIP Stadia, but it's also *such* a nice controller to use on Android and Windows PC.

Does anyone actually enjoy this? I just find it a vague time waster and mildly condescending, as if the devs think that this is enough to fool me into thinking there's more content than there really is.

Devs, if you're reading this, you really don't have to make up two options if the difference won't change anything. It is a waste of both your time and ours!! In Stars and Time is a great example of a game where you only get one choice on what to say and--guess what? It's great.

Like why is even there?

2: SA-X encounters in Metroid fusion. The game in general is a little disturbing especially in the second half but man those SA-X encounters freaked me out sometimes.

3: Metroid Prime 1 on GameCube freaked me out the most especially when fighting the space pirates in the dark. As a kid I was too scared to play but eventually beat it when i was a teenager.

4: Earthbound also on the last level and final boss of the game. That last section is really strange and made me feel a little creeped out. I wont lie I was getting a little panicked during the ending of the boss fight, it was one big WTF moment because it was so unexpected.

Those games you play, when you're downloading the 155gb that is Stalker 2, for example. The games you dive into when you're waiting for that casserole to bake, and the stuff you play that you can just leave anytime and dive back-in. Does not absolutely have to be an RPG.

I'm not good at explaining without examples, so

Enter the Gungeon  
Stalker: Call of Pripyat with Misery mod  
Slay the Spire  
Risen  
Gothic 3  
Freelancer  
Noita  
modded Bethesda games  
Everspace  
Starsector

Basically something with a crapton of content OR replayability - ideally both, that has a good deal of complexity.

However I'd like to avoid games like Kenshi, Civilization, Stellaris etc. because they are too time-consuming with not enough dopamine hits such as finding a unique piece of gear, location or finishing a difficult quest.

Didn't really vibe with:

Darkest Dungeon (repetitive, boring combat)  
Binding of Isaac (combat also not as fun)  
Hades (not enough equipment variety, mostly about skills)  
any last-stand type of game  
Balatro  
Cult of the Lamb (setting)  
Don't Starve (It's time-consuming)  
Deep Rock Galactic (fun only with friends and I'm looking for singleplayer)  
Rimworld (time consuming)  
Stoneshard (boring, repetitive, not enough content)  
Quasimorph (same studio as above, same problems)  
Dwarf Fortress (time consuming)

gaming,1jnvnuc,"Atomfall: Shallow, tedious, and unrewarding.","Overall, I’m going to give the game a 5/10. It’s super addicting at first, and the exploration is novel, if not highly restrictive. The lack of a mini map wouldn’t be so bad if you didn’t have to press THREE buttons just to open the regular map. 

Combat is one of the worst parts of the game, as it gets very tedious very quickly. There is no progression in the game as weapon upgrade barely do anything noticeable, and you leave almost every fight with less than you had before you started. Stealth is available, but it’s janky AF, and you’ll get spotted if you come within 100 feet of an enemy. Lack of armor or other gear means you can never close the equipment gap, especially with the enemies in the third area, and the main story area. 

Oh, and enemies respawn anytime you leave one of the hub areas, and seemingly pop up out of nowhere. More often than not, I’ll scout an area, find 5-6 enemies, only to have 10 more pop up seemingly out of nowhere once the fighting starts. 

Weapon variety is disappointing to say the least, and as I said; upgrades never really feel like actual upgrades. Skill points have to be found because combat gives no exp, and none of them make you go “yeah, the game is better now that I have this!”

The story…exists. All of this to say that I’ve hit the 10 hour mark, feel like I’m about 60% done, and I don’t even want to finish. Only play this game if you want an extra chore that you’ll feel obligated to finish.

Edit 2: There are some really good suggestions, but we probably wont be playing games like Helldivers 2 because it would require each having their own system, but they have an Xbox and PS5 and Xbox doesnt have Helldivers 2. So only 2 can play that game. This would have been a good rec otherwise and we would have played in an easier difficulty.

gaming,1k44q8v,Game Recommendations For a 60+ Retiree,"Hello everyone, as you could probably guess from the title, I am in search of video game recommendations for my 60+ year old retired mother.

Now for some background information, I got my mother into gaming at a stressful point in her work career which was also near the end of her professional life. At this point, these games were fairly simple, cozy, and relaxing. They were an escape from the stress. This mostly was taken up by Animal Crossing New Horizons. 

Now that my mother has retired, the stress of a full time job is gone and her time is free. She’s really adapted well to this change, and has also picked up gaming at an alarming pace. By this I mean, she has sunk 300+ hours between TOTK and BOTW, as well as a good chunk of time in Echoes of Wisdom. Evidently a Zelda fan. Outside of Zelda she has also enjoyed and completed Hogwarts Legacy and Witcher 3 to which she said “it felt too short”.  She’s currently replaying Witcher. 

Currently she only has a switch, but I am helping her look into getting a PC since she really has been enjoying gaming especially in her retirement.

From what she has told me, The Witcher 3 is her favourite game so far with the Zelda series being close behind. In terms of preference from a broader sense, she enjoys games that provide an adventure, a good story, and a somewhat cinematic experience. Difficulty wise, she’s been ramping up, she enjoyed the combat to The Witcher, but she can get overwhelmed and stressed out when games have too many different button inputs, or overwhelming combat. 

Please let me know some good game recommendations that she could play on switch.",24,0.63,109,2025-04-21 04:07:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1k44q8v/game_recommendations_for_a_60_retiree/,TheSpecialApple

My son would like to have all his buddies over for a gaming themed & focused ""LAN Party"". Has anyone else done on for their kid(s)? How did you go about it, and what types of ideas did you have? Were there any unexpected challenges?  
  
All his 6 friends he's inviting has a console at home, and we only have the one Xbox but have access to multiple TVs - so my thoughts are to inquire if the parents would be willing to let their kids bring their console/controller? 

Other cool Idea's I've though up are having ChatGPT create 'e-sports style logos' of their gamer names and printing stuff (ie: cups, maybe shirts) with their logo on it at their stations. 

Fortnite is the game they'll likely be playing. 

I do have 2g WIFI and ethernet cables to take the load off WIFI. 

Other than that, just ordering a bunch of gamer-themed decorations and making sure they're all in the same room close to the router.

gaming,1k4or57,Sonic as a Metroidvania - The Perfect Game formula for a New Direction in the Series?,"Hear me out;

A re-imagining of a 2D Sonic game. think of a world in the vein of games like Ori and the Blind forest, Hollow Knight et al. Incredible 2D visuals with the upgrade gameplay formula of Super Metroid, You play as Sonic, you're dropped into a mysterious new island, you have a huge 2D open world to explore, you need to gather the chaos emeralds which have been scattered all over, with each granting you a new ability, the game has different biomes instead of traditional linear  levels or 'Zones' and 'Acts' with A to B gameplay. The standard metroidvania gameplay loop is intact allowing certain areas and biomes to be accessed when new abilities are discovered.

The reason why I think this is perfect:

* The giant open world is perfect for the gimmick - speed and traversal + exploration, something the classic stage/zone formula fails to balance correctly due to the constrained limitations of each linear level, affecting the 'flow' of the game, instead of A - B gameplay, you must backtrack and explore and familiarize yourself with the world - the game world can be perfectly designed for his abilities without the usual annoying hurdles found in linear levels, areas can be seamless instead. The map can be designed with much more care and attention.

* Chaos emeralds are literally the perfect item for collecting in key areas to regain an ability - unlock spin dash - unlock speed rush - unlock homing attack, super sonic? - etc. etc., A boss can be fought at each emerald location.

* Rings can be collected as healing, dispersed when defeating basic enemies in the overworld, they actually serve some purpose other than a glorified 1-hit shield.

* One of the main problems people have with the older games in a 2D space is a conflict of objectives, they think you're supposed to race to the end as quick as possible since it's all about speed, just to run into egregiously placed enemy and/or spikes and stuff causing for irritating and unclear objectives, there is no need for that in an open end-to-end world design, speed can co-exist with exploration much more naturally.

* With the idea of upgrade abilities allowing increased speed and finesse of movement, past areas can be blasted through with ease and lower level enemies dispatched as you become stronger, again lending a better gameplay feel; the sense of speed and abilities of his character, something which again is constrained as an idea in the older level-based approach with poor balance.

The whole identity of a 2D sonic game is intact, loop-de-loops and all, it just opens up a whole new design potential and allows better curation for that style of game in the 2D formula, being able to interact with the world and change the world through your actions is huge.

It can't just be me who feels this, the Metroidvania genre is practically crying out for a Sonic game! It almost feels made for it.",25,0.61,41,2025-04-21 21:09:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1k4or57/sonic_as_a_metroidvania_the_perfect_game_formula/,InfiniteAir

gaming,1jxulqc,Is there a genre for games like this?,"So I recently played a few games that I have ABSOLUTELY fallen in love with, and I wanted to see if this is actually part of a broader genre or not.  The two games are Wayfinder and Dungeons of Sundaria.  Basically, these games are multiplayer dungeon crawlers where you complete short, 5-30min PvE dungeons that have traditional MMO-style mechanics (lots of boss mechanics, a focus on optimizing skill rotations, active dodging, etc.).  Unfortunately ,development for both games has unofficially stopped.  Wayfinder suffered from some launch issues that gave it a rough start, and Dungeons of Sundaria is run by a indie team that may or may not have had the resources to support it long-term.

Is there a name for this genre?  Are there other games that offer similar styles of gameplay?

  
I have tried a few games that are in similar niches such as Deep Rock Galactic and Vermintide.  However, these are all far more FPS-heavy, don't really have anything to speak of for boss mechanics, and have essentially no traditional RPG-style skills or gear progression.  Rabbit and Steel is the closest alternate game I've found, but it is a roguelike with minimal meta progression or gearing.  The key mechanics that set the games I'm interested in apart are:

* Multiplayer w/ PvE focus
* RPG-style gear/character build progression
* MMO-style skills and multiple class roles

Assuming they all still work, I've got an OG/360/One, and PS2 & PS4 stashed back there. Think I also have an N64 and GC, and I may even still have my 3DS around here somewhere. Ideally I'm looking for titles that could be found in like the bargain bin of a GameStop type store, so they're cheap and if he doesn't like them it's no big loss, but digital isn't out of the question on the One/PS4. No PC gaming. 

What are some titles you might suggest for any of those platforms?",15,0.61,97,2025-04-20 01:57:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1k3c04s/games_for_older_gamers/,FreddyForshadowing

gaming,1k5cin7,Which games have the best hubs or home bases?,"I love it when games have a hub or a home base that grows and changes as you play through the game. 

I think the first time I really saw this was Assassin’s Creed where you had a mansion that would fill up with the collectibles and items you found and you could also help build a town.

A recent favorite is the Base in Horizon Forbidden West. It starts off feeling cold and empty, completely metal. But as you play through the game, your companions work to make it feel like home and you get to see it evolve into a beautiful living space. I also love that some collectibles are presented within.

gaming,1jmq555,AC Shadows Side Content Isn’t Good,"I’m a huge AC fan. I’ve played every release the day they come out. I loved Valhalla and I understand that opinion can be polarizing because it’s so bloated (which I agree about) but I feel like the past three games were so much more interesting.

The mysteries, raids, even flighting I found much more enjoyable than what Shadows is doing. Shadows side content boils down to find these pages, pray at these shrines, draw this bird, do this rhythm mini game. It’s so incredibly boring.

I don’t understand why they didn’t have things like a ninja star throwing game, riddle solving, pouring tea and cooling it properly (kind of like the ramen mini game from Yakuza) idk anything other than this would have been better.

I still like the game, don’t get me wrong, but good lord is a lot of my gameplay so far spent doing mind numbing menial tasks.",13,0.52,152,2025-03-29 16:30:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1jmq555/ac_shadows_side_content_isnt_good/,seedlessgrapez
gaming,1k352u9,Wii U Pro Controller on PC,"The Wii U Pro controller has been my absolute favorite controller.  Ever since my wired xbox 360 controller stopped working, I've been using the DS4 for PC gaming. I don't hate it, but the fit in my hand sucks and I feel like there's less control in the analog stick. Not a fan of the bumpers either.

Throughout the 13 years since it came out, I've tried to connect the Wii U controller to PC. An adapter came out years ago but I didn't want to screw around with that. I decided to check out if something has changed yesterday. Turns out, there's a program called WiiUSoft that allows you to connect the controller to the PC with no adapter through bluetooth. It emulates the controller as an xbox controller and you can edit the button mapping.

I tried it out yesterday and it worked flawlessly. Saved me the $70 for a new Xbox controller. I played with it all yesterday and left it on overnight and it's still at 80% battery.

Thought I'd share for those of you that were in my position and wanted to breathe new life into an awesome controller.",10,0.58,22,2025-04-19 20:06:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1k352u9/wii_u_pro_controller_on_pc/,Lichius

Edit: ik im gonna get hate for a simple post, didn’t wanna mention it but its mainly due to anxiety and depression.

gaming,1jsuvkc,"On-Rush, the racing game I wish got the support it deserved","Back in….oh I wanna say 2018-2019, PS plus had a new game for free called On-Rush. 

Now I’m not a big racing game player. I enjoy Mario Kart and Crash team racing and that’s about it. 

But oh my gosh this game was SO FUN! A cool variety of vehicles, beautifully rendered maps with all sort of environmental hazards and additions. I love that you could use your vehicle as a weapon, by either crushing other cars off a jump and blasting through them with a boost. 

And the MUSIC! Oh my gosh. The music was so epic and energetic and badass that I even found the songs and added them to my playlist. 

It was the first racing game in years that I was having the time of my life playing. 

But then the game studio shut down within a few months and the game never even started its first competitive season. 

It’s been years and I’m still really bummed about it! The concept was different and unique, the game was polished and well made. It makes me sad for the devs who worked on this game, they clearly worked hard and did a very good job! I still have a small inkling of hope that some game developer will notice what a gem this game had the potential to be and will revive it.
