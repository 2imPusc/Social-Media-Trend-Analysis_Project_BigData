travel,1jq6ezf,ml5w2ho,"Just a word of warning - Luanda airport and TAAG Airlines are both the absolute worst I've ever used. We flew from Johannesburg to Sao Paulo and back via Luanda around Christmas 2022. It was absolutely awful.

The airport was total chaos. There was no toilet paper or soap in the bathrooms. The only open shop was one expensive Duty Free store. There was one café with horrible food and the worst coffee on earth. 

The signs showed information that was hours out of date so finding the right gate was essentially guesswork- walking up to other passengers and asking ""is this the gate for the Sao Paulo flight?"" until we found it. Once we found the right gate and they checked our documents, they let us through to a smaller area to wait for a bus to the plane. We sat there for over an hour with no information about what was happening and couldn't get back out to get water or snacks. Then suddenly the bus showed up and we went to the plane without any kind of explanation of why we were so delayed.

The ridiculousness continued on the plane. Many of the seats were broken - permanently reclined, broken armrests, missing seat cushions etc. The in-flight entertainment system didn't work at all and the remotes had been ripped off several seats and bare wires were sticking out. When I tried to activate my reading light in the aisle seat, my daughter's reading light in the window seat turned on instead, because they'd been wired up wrong. It's genuinely the only time I've been concerned that I might die because the plane was in such poor condition - if they couldn't even wire the lights correctly, what else had they got wrong?! 

The return journey was the same. The only slight positive is that the plane was almost empty so each of us had a whole row to ourselves and could try to lie down and sleep. I say try, because the arm rests didn't fold up all the way in the middle seats so you had to wedge yourself in under them.

If there is a way to get to your destination without using this airline and airport I would strongly advise you to do so.

travel,1jov3e3,mkuqx33,"1. All you have to do to view the Black Madonna is head to the church and hop in the queue off to the side of main church entrance. When I went (August), I'd guess it took about 30-40 min. to progress through the queue and then you'll go through the Madonna ""tour"" over another 20-30 min. You won't have an issue seeing the Madonna and that portion of the Monastery is open all day (or close to it). I believe you can just go in/out of the church itself via the main entrance as you please.
2. Probably a few hours without any rushing required, it just depends on your pace. It looks like guided tours take 5-7 hours (incl. travel to/from Barcelona), so that's probably about as reliable a source as there is.
3. You'll have plenty of time for it, so you might as well
4. It's hard to say when you've only been there once, but I was there during the high season and while there were plenty of visitors that day it never felt especially crowded. There's enough space and enough different things to do or see for the Monastery to accommodate *a lot* of visitors at one time. I didn't do the funicular, but saw the Madonna around lunch time, and the wait wasn't bad at all, as indicated above.

But, if it’s like “hey, you can a hire a guide to take you and 20 strangers to a hike / pub crawl / food tour / museum” I’m not too inclined to pay for something I could do or discover myself.

travel,1jm2an4,mk97ge0,I personally enjoy hiring a local guide unless it’s a very basic easy to do thing that would be silly to have a guide for. Having a local guide takes so much of the stress off your own back and also is a super great way to learn about the area you are visiting. It’s also a way to support the local economy where you are traveling. A lot of destinations depend on tourism quite heavily and need people to actually spend money in the community instead of just spending money on hotel and flights. I am of the opinion that if you are travel somewhere be prepared to spend money outside of your hotel and try to focus on buying from local businesses (example: instead of booking with a big international company that hires local guides just book directly with the local guides or eat lunch at a locally owned restaurant instead of the familiar international chain).,3,2025-03-28 21:28:55,zara97wild

travel,1jm0w4v,mka1ons,"Kotor to Perast is a 15 km drive, unless you are on a tight budget you could consider taking a taxi if the busses are not available. Keep in mind that Perast is a tiny, albeit beautiful, place. You need like 20 minutes to explore it all. I'm not sure how long the boat ride to the island is, but I have a feeling it's a shame to spend a whole day on just Perast and the island. Maybe take a look at the Kotor cable car, from there you get a sort of similar views as you'd get at Grlo Sokolovo.

I've checked the link for that tour, and I agree with you, two hours in a boat sound a bit like a waste of time, as the view from high up down on the lake is much more impressive than the other way round. Driving 15-30 minutes from Virpazar already gets you to some great lookout points, it's a shame they don't do it in the tour. Keep in mind that Virpazar itself is tiny, but situated on a really beautiful spot.

Budva Old Town is nice, but sort of similar to Kotor Old town. You don't *need* to do them both.

Looking at your itinerary, I have a feeling you're spending way too much time in Podgorica.

I'd suggest looking up these things:

1) Ostrog Monastery - even if religion isn't your thing, a place like this is not common.

The New Town is super hippie and alternative, so the vibe is super chill. There is a lot of cool street art, restaurants and cafes there. Not to mention, it's where all the pubs are. There are endless places to see live music every day. 

There's also the very cool Kunsthof passage, the military historical museum, the most beautiful dairy shop in the world Pfunds Molkerei, the Heide forest for hiking/ walks. 

The Old Town is historical and very gorgeous. My favourite museum is there: the Residents' Castle, and within 5 minutes you can reach the Zwinger, the Opera house (which is gorgeous, incredibly well known, and if you enjoy that kind of thing, seeing a performance there is wonderful). 

Not to mention Brühlsche Terrasse, which is beautiful, the Frauenkirche, the Kreuzkirche, the Hygiene Museum (despite the name, it's not about soap). The Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister ia a great museum as well. Or you could visit the Panometer. 

Or if you want to get out of the city, there is endless hiking in the Saxony Switzerland national park, which you can reach easily by train in less than an hour, or go to Pillnitz, Meißen, Leipzig for a day trip.

Domestic it's fine, typically the flights aren't that long so whatever, is a bit annoying that basically every single time my carry on gets weighed so I'm always super careful to not be over the limit.

International, it's OK but I wouldn't want to fly too far, horrendous food options which you have to pay for, have to pay for entertainment (they give you literally the worst earbuds known to man), seat selection, luggage etc. It's ok, usually still works out alright. The food was such a bummer though, meal service not long after take off and not long before landing and the biggest thing you could get was some lasagna.

travel,1jiz7aq,mjjkypn,"Sounds like an awesome trip coming up. June is a great time for Malaysia, especially the east coast islands since it's their dry season.

It's definitely possible to visit one of the east coast islands like Redang, Perhentian, or Tioman within your 14-day itinerary without spending too much time on the road, especially if you're strategic with transport. Here’s a quick breakdown:

# 1. Time-Saving Options

* Fly to the east coast:
   * For Redang or Perhentian, fly from KL to Kuala Terengganu (TGG) or Kota Bharu (KBR)—about 1 hour flight, then a 30–45 min drive to the jetty, and a 30–60 min boat ride.
   * For Tioman, it's trickier. No direct flights from KL or SG (unless you charter). You’d need to get to Mersing Jetty (4–5 hrs from SG/KL) and take a 2-hour ferry. Slightly more effort.

# 2. Suggested Route Idea

* Day 1-3: Arrive in Singapore, quick revisit, rest and eat well.
* Day 4-5: Bus or train to Malacca (4 hours).
* Day 6-8: Head to KL (2 hours).
* Day 9-11: Fly to Kuala Terengganu or Kota Bharu for Redang or Perhentian.
* Day 12-14: Fly to Penang (George Town) from east coast or return to KL then Penang.
* Fly back to Singapore from Penang or KL for your flight home.

# Why East Coast Over Langkawi?

* East coast islands have clearer water, better snorkeling, and richer marine life than Langkawi.
* June is ideal for these islands, whereas Langkawi is good year-round but less striking IMO.

If you're going to Tioman, Pahang doesnt have much except for Taman Negara, Although i am unsure if you can go via Kuantan, i might be wrong, but you'd only basically spend time in Tioman. Johor is longer but has many more things like great national parks and food culture rivaling Penang. Spending a day or two in Terengganu before getting to Perhentian Island is also good.

travel,1k3e9mv,mo1osh8,"I live in Spain, I use Iberia very frequently, and unfortunately can confirm your fears. The airline has improved significantly over the years. Inflight service is generally great now, their on-time record is excellent and Madrid is actually an efficient hub that works well, other than ongoing baggage problems. It is absolutely their Achilles heel. 

It doesn't seem to matter if your final destination is Madrid or you are connecting in Madrid. Bags to the belt in Madrid can easily take an hour even if the airport is quiet. I've had connecting flights with transit times of one hour and four hours, and they've failed to get my bags on the flight to my final destination. 

All of this said, my experience is that 8 out of 10 ten times they get it right. A 20% fail rate isn't particularly good but based on probability, your bags should make the connection. 

If they don't , here are some of my tips to ease the pain of the entire process:

1. While you're standing at the belt in Lisbon waiting for the bags start filling the claim online, effectively doing the Property Irregularity Report (PIR- airline speak for lost bags) before the belt stops.  This can be done via a QR that can be scanned at airport or find the link on their website before you travel. Do this immediately, it can always be cancelled. If you don't, you'll be forced to wait in what will likely be a long queue at the airport, with others who have lost their bags. 

2. When you need to answer the question of whether to deliver the bags to your destination or pick them up at the airport, choose pick them up at airport. Delivering the bags is obviously easier for you, but it's another complicated step in the process and it doesn't work well. Iberia contracts with third parties (like most airlines) to deliver the bags from them to you and my experience is this step works poorly too. By choosing to have them hold the bag at the airport you eliminate this risk and likely delay. I've had situations where they couldn't get my bag to me after four days, and it's very frustrating. In typical Iberia fashion they had little information, they will tell you it's out of their hands and then might even blame you. Lisbon airport is very close to city centre. It's easy to get to the airport. You should receive text messages that say what the status is and what flight your bag is on. When you receive this go to the airport to pick it up. 

3. If your bag doesn't make it, don't hesitate to start buying necessities immediately. They are legally responsible for payment for many things but not everything. Clothing and personal care items for sure, electronics less likely to be paid. Save all detailed receipts with explanation of what everything is, but don't file the claim until you receive your bag. If you file the claim early, they'll agree to it and tell you this is your agreement and they will use that to prevent further claims. Ultimately if they don't find your bag (they will) you'll want to do a lot of shopping to replace what you've lost. Start that process early. Buy as much as you can or have you immediately. 

4. The online portal to track your bags doesn't update in anything close to real time so don't depend on it. When they find your bag you will get a text message that is accurate. Then go to airport to collect. Calling them is a waste of time. One person will tell you one thing,  another something completely different, within a short period of time. This is particularly true if you choose to have the bag delivered to your hotel or residence which is another reason why you should pick it up at the airport. Once it's out of the hands of Iberia in the airport and in the hands of the delivery company they have no information and no control. 

The key to surviving this is to take a few steps to mitigate your risk. Obviously don't pack everything in the checked bag. Keep very very important stuff like medication with you on the plane. Always take one day's worth of clothing and some toiletries with you on the plane as well. File the claim online and early and choose to pick it up at the airport which gives you more control over the entire process. 

Please understand I'm not trying to scare you but I'm just trying to give you insight into the process and share the things you can do to make it better for you. 

I take about 10 Iberia flights per month so I have a lot of data points to draw from and these are my conclusions and this is what I've learned to do when it happens to me. Worth noting I've written to them several times to tell them how awful their baggage services and in particular that they have a serious problem in Madrid but they don't respond to that and nothing ever changes. 

Anyway good luck and if you have any other questions let me know",10,2025-04-20 05:13:02,trekwithme

* Cut down on flights (you don't want to feel like you spent all your time in airports)

* Don't be afraid to just stick to Malaysian Borneo (biased because I never went to Indonesian part) 

* Kuching, Sarawak is actually a pretty nice city for walking around, food, and sightseeing nearby places for a couple days (like a trip to Bako National Park for hikes and monekys or Semenggoh Nature Reserve for orangutans)

In general, you're likely to get some flack from this sub about your itinerary being too busy, and that you should slow down. I think it is a personal preference thing. What does ""traveling"" or ""visiting a place” mean to you? If it means taking a selfie in front of someplace pretty so you can tell people you've been there, then this itinerary accomplishes that. You'll spend a lot of time in transit so you can collect those photos. That transport can be an activity in and of itself. If it were me, I would probably cut out all of the day trips so you can spend more time actually seeing the places you're visiting and less time moving around. But this isn't my trip, it is yours.

I've checked out [alsa cyclo tours before](https://colmarbiketours.com/fr/guided_tours), and if you look at each of their tour options, it shows a map of points of interest that they take you to during the tour. 

As far as other suggestions for the area are concerned: 

I would suggest maybe spending one of those days in Strasbourg, as it's only a 30 minute train ride from Colmar, and just a wonderful place. I'm absolutely enamoured with that city, and will be returning for a visit myself in the beginning of May.

First off, the person that recommended all the Milwaukee stuff is spot on. It’s a great town that offers a ton of things to do and food to eat without being overrun by people. 

If you happen to be here July 21-27, one of the world’s largest air shows takes place in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. It’s an experience! Housing costs are ridiculous, but it’s drivable from Milwaukee if you’re going for the day. 

All of the places you’ve mentioned a good- the Dells is overwhelmingly touristy, but if you want a water park, it’s a good option. I’d also recommend looking into Michigan’s west coast on Lake Michigan. In 2-3 hours you can be to places like South Haven, Holland, Grand Haven, and Saugatuck. They’re all cute towns with nice beaches. Or, if you want to get crazy- go to Milwaukee and then take the SS Badger from Manitowoc, Wisconsin to Ludington, Michigan. It’s a ferry and can be a fun adventure. 

In Illinois, Starved Rock State Park is great for a day out in nature. It’s fairly large and has a bunch of trails to walk/hike. It’s a couple of hours west of Chicago. While you’re in Chicago, definitely go to a Cubs game- it’s an experience.",5,2025-04-15 10:54:28,arsenalgooner77

https://www.cntraveler.com/story/where-to-eat-stay-and-play-in-milwaukee 

Milwaukee also made National Geographic’s Best of the World list in 2023.

It is only a short train ride north from Chicago (or a quick drive if you rent a car).

If you come July 3-5, you can attend the last weekend of Summerfest, which is one of the largest music festivals in the world that takes place on the shore of Lake Michigan.
https://www.summerfest.com/

Additionally, the Milwaukee Air & Water Show is July 19-20 also on the shore of Lake Michigan. 

You can rent kayaks and kayak up and down the river and into Lake Michigan, stopping at bars and restaurants along the way. You can take a fishing charter on the lake as well. Like Chicago, there are lots of events and festivals in Milwaukee during the summer, though they are generally less crowded and more affordable than those in Chicago. There is a well regarded art museum near the lake, and for the kids there is a downtown science museum called Discovery World.

For sports, you could attend a Milwaukee Brewers baseball game and tailgate beforehand (grill out in the parking lot while the kids play catch). Tailgate parties before the baseball game are popular in Milwaukee and there is a distinct ‘murica vibe to it that you may enjoy.

There are excellent restaurants, a large beach, and many other things to do. This website is a good starting point.

travel,1jzewyr,mn6fy8p,"It does seem a tad bit rushed. I get the urge to see as much as possible in a short period of time but if you’re rushing from one city to the next you may end up missing out on stuff. Make a list of the essential things you want to see/do/eat per city and then a list of maybes so you can focus on the stuff that’s important to you. 

I did 2 months through Europe last year and made a rule to do 3-4 nights minimum per big city and 1-2 per small city. I only did 1 night at a few cities where I was able to book an overnight train or bus to my next stop. That way I was able to enjoy the city for 2 full days. Left my baggage at my hotel for a small fee, there’s also company’s/apps that will store your baggage for a small fee.

I’ve been to Prague and Munich and they both fell in the 3-4 nights type of cities for me. I did 3 in Prague and 4 in Munich, I also did a half day tour to see the famous “Disney” castle for my partner and took a train ride to Salzburg for the day and enjoyed some night life in Munich after. 

If I were you I’d extend Munich and see more of that city, potentially do a half day trip to whatever interests you. I used viator to book tours, but logged in through rakuten to take advantage of 6-10% cash back.

4. Not difficult. When you get off the train, find a staff member and they will tell you either the platform your second train departs from (in that case you can board the train directly, sometimes they even accompany you), or they'll ask you to go to the waiting lounge with big screens (it will depend on the time you have for the change, then you'll have to show your ticket again to board the train).",6,2025-04-14 18:10:59,hydr0dynamics

The food is SIGNIFICANTLY better in Mexico, and Oaxaca in particular is a paradise for food. The flipside is that Oaxaca is also a lot more touristy and definitely more expensive. However, you can also head down to Puerto Escondido from Oaxaca proper, which has a lot more backpacker vibes; it's a big surfing spot so you'll meet a lot of people from all over the world. From PE you can also head down to Zipolite (big hippie refuge in the 60s with extremely crunchy vibes) and/or Mazunte (the setting of Boca Del Cielo in the movie Y Tu Mama Tambien. Mazunte in particular is just a HUGE beach with gentle tides and ramshackle hostels (Zipolite has a MEAN riptide, don't go in the water deeper than like your knees); I was there with some other backpackers and literally ALL we did there was swim during the day, smoke the cheapest & worst weed on earth at sundown, and eat cheap tourist food and drink margs at night. CDMX is really fun and varied and you'll be hard pressed to find better food for as cheap as it is; the Coyoacan market legitimately changed my life, and Chapultepec is nearly the platonic ideal of a public park.

Nicaragua though is going to have significantly better hiking and natural experiences. Guides are cheap, hostels are plentiful, and getting around is generally pretty easy. I had a priceless experience hiking up Ometepe in Lago de Nicaragua (do NOT go up without a guide), and I heard that the refuge around the Costa Rican border is incredible (though I can't vouch).

travel,1jur5gi,mm68qti,"Main reason it may not be cheap is if you are looking too short term (under 3 months) or it's very popular time to travel (school breaks, national holidays). Or both in worst case.



Best way to find flights is usually to check google flights for companies being able to fly the route you want and then going to their Web site to book it. 


Layover flights with low cost carriers is usually self transfer. And that means no protection from missing flights due to delay, and going over multiple bookings. I advise against it unless you have a lot of time to spare and can easily cover unexpected bigger expenses.



Low cost companies I know that fly from Belgrade are Wizzair (within Europe mainly) and FlyDubai (Asia). 


To find really cheap flights can take time and likely won't be simple go to one web site and book it. 


My advice is to look at google flights for routes and book one of those. That will be cheapest with most security and comfort. And since Belgrade does tend to be more expensive, always check Budapest, Vienna, Timisoara or Sofia, if you are willing to drive/take a bus to get there. 


And book with airlines directly, if you book with someone else, you may have trouble if any delay or cancellation happens. Or if you want to change something. Usually it's not worth a bit you may save with them.


Many super cheap flights are also just gone, it was much cheaper to fly pre pandemic, especially within Europe. No more under 20€ one way flights (within Europe, just hand luggage).",5,2025-04-09 07:01:46,Ivien

The more flexible you are with time and destinations the cheaper it is. This is the most relevant advice, and just what most people do.

If you travel within europe look up direct flights from ryanair/wizzair/easyjets/etc. 

If you travel outside of Europe, look up flights on momondo. Look where the stopover is. Sometimes it make sense to book directly to that stopover first, stay a bit and than travel to your final destinations. 
This is not relevant to most people, more an advice to experienced travellers.

travel,1jur5gi,mm7pmvn,"google flights lets you compare flights from multiple origins to multiple destinations (so you can find flights from Skopje, Nis and Belgrade to London for example, finding the cheapest flight and which city it’s from in the results). 

I’ll be honest, Skyscanner is fairly garbage imo when it comes to comparing dates for travel i don’t know why people keep recommending it lol. I generally just end up using multiple tabs of google flights to try and build an itinerary. Find the cities you want and book it yourself. Other than layovers with a single carrier I advise against trying to get this all done in one booking, especially if it’s with LCC/ULCC in Europe. Also as it’s one of your first trips, maybe try to keep it simple for now with a single destination on a short period so you can start getting experience and used to things. 

Usually i book a round trip to a destination, or maybe an open jaw (fly into City A, fly home from City D) whilst making seperate one way bookings for flights from City A to City B, City B to City C (or sometimes I can get a nice long layover included for City A to City C via City B) and then a final booking for City C to City D. Often within Europe I can just book multiple one ways with LCC as the round trip isn’t actually cheaper unless you’re with a Full Service airline. 


I’ll include an upcoming example: 

I’ll be going to Latvia and Estonia this summer. 

I booked a one way from London to Tallinn for £45.

I made a seperate one way booking from Tallinn to Riga for £15

Then one more final booking from Riga to London for £24.

Generally opioids and psychotropic medication can be an issue where you might need to get some type of permission before arriving into the country (e.g Japan and UAE) but others tend to be fine (as you say cannabis is a no-no in lots of countries)

Some of the scary stories have a lot more going on behind the headline. For example the case in Egypt about tramadol was because she brought in about 6 months worth and the medication was not prescribed to her. 

I have a letter from my doctor setting out all my medications and also a copy of my prescription. I only take enough for my stay, some countries have limits (between 1-3 months) 

Some places I look at are the UK government travel advice section as that tends to indicate if there are particular issues that you need to be aware of 

Also I will search the trip advisor forum as often there will be advice there too",2,2025-04-08 15:52:11,ChelseaGirls66
travel,1jug23h,mm20226,"> How do you handle this? 

Do your research, check whether your medication is approved in the countries you visit/transit? Check whether there are ingredients that are a controlled substance in the countries involved? Though maybe not 100% foolproof, the answers on those two questions go a long way in assessing the risk. If you have trouble finding a reliable enough answer, ask an expert. 

> Can the embassy certify in advance that you are allowed to bring it?

Maybe, but I strongly suspect they won't. Maybe they will if the country has a strong interest in your visit, but for ordinary tourists I would be highly surprised if they did. It is your responsibility to comply with the law. If you have doubts it is your responsibility to inform yourself. Do your research, consult an expert... I've the impression that in reality it is rarely an issue and if it is, there often seems to be something fishy going on.

Depends on the type of medication. Best approach is to go see a doctor and ask for it. A prescription and contact details of your doctor at home can ease the process.

In Berlin, I stayed at the spot where Humboldt lived and did Humboldt sightseeing around the city. In Venice I followed Vivaldi. Uzbekistan, Amir Timur and Ulug Bek. In Poland, Copernicus.

I try to be thorough and recreate their life where possible. For example, with Matsuo Basho, I visited Tohoku during June, which is the month he was there, so I could hear the cicadas in the rocks at Yamadera like he describes. With Copernicus, I visited the house where he grew up (it's a good historical museum now) and took an old boat up the Vistula river (he took a boat when going to university) and went star gazing. In Venice, I listened to a concert in the orphanage/church where Vivaldi composed most of his works and where they were performed for the first time.

I like to take my time and just stand in a place, try to imagine what it was like. What they heard, saw, thought.

travel,1jpkua3,ml09k8g,"Coming from Croatia and having lived in western Europe for a few years now, a note about the weather: in coastal Croatia it's common to have nice sunny days throughout the year but when it's raining it comes down pouring, whereas in the west I get a feeling there's weeks of gray skies and light drizzles. So maybe you'll have some days where you'll just have to spend time inside but it will pass quickly so the best plan is to be open for change of plans. On the coast a lot of restaurants close down so you'll have limited choice, and the winter ferry lines are more sparse. Buses between bigger cities are running frequently enough that it shouldn't be a problem. Most of the attractions are outdoors, it's more about the vibe of the cities really which is obviously nicer when it's sunny. I think the museums should still be open but they aren't huge so you can't just kill a whole day inside. Zagreb is definitely more lively during that time so you might want to spend some time there after Slovenia rather than going directly to the south. I would say that visiting in October would actually be more fitting for an authentic Balkan trip experience because you would be more likely to meet a local at a bar and start a conversation with them rather than just being surrounded by tourists (though I am still surprised when I come home for Christmas and I still hear tourists in my hometown).",4,2025-04-02 11:32:21,authenticallyaverage

I’ve traveled solo, used tour operators, etc.  in Kenya and I’m returning this year, probably August. Want to go cheap, you can do cheap there. Get to Nairobi, and stay in a tent camp out in Karen suburbs. 
First the parks, they are remote, you have to get there. Public transport via matatu from Nairobi will get you close if you want the fabulous Mara region. Or by bus, all from the CBD area. But you will need transport to wherever you stay. Talek Gate area has some really cheap camping options. Then the parks, they are huge, the only way to see them is by booking a Safari and you can do that there in camp. You will be paying in cash. ATMs in town. 

Here is how you can do it. Take matatu from Nairobi to Narok. Ride ends in the big busy transport center. Tell your driver what you want he can advise you. anyway just check around the many travel offices there. Or walk across the street to the supermarket. See those guys all standing around, they are drivers. It is a long drive down to the reserve yet, but this will get you there cheap.

I would take a good 6 days from Barcelona for this(since you have been there).

* I would take 4 days from Barcelona and add a stop or two between AMS and Munich....tons of options, but that is a long train ride

* If you have a rail trip over 4-5 hours, I always consider adding in a stop for a day or two, or cut the city out and save it for another time.

For this area, consider places like Menton, Villefranche-sur-Mer, Èze, or Saint-Paul-de-Vence. These towns are just so much nicer and more authentic, and then from these places you can go visit Nice/Monaco as long as you see fit - they're all well connected by train.

In the same vein, Toulon and Marseille are not worth staying in (personally). Especially Toulon. What a dump. Instead stay in Cassis or Aix-en-Provence and then visit Marseille. Lyon is absolutely fantastic and well worth a longer stay, but consider perhaps 1 night in Annecy or at least a day trip there. Also for your stay in Paris, I know you haven't much time otherwise I'd have recommended doing a day trip to either Provins, Rouen, or Strasbourg since it seems you don't have any medieval French cities in your itinerary.

Also, as a final note: please for the love of god just skip Brussels altogether. It's such a grungy whatever city and most Europeans would tell you the same.

Seville is the best place to stay for your plan. It has the most direct train lines to all the cities you listed. I also argue it has the most to see and do outside of Granada. 

Granada itself should be at least 2-3 days to visit. It's an amazing city. Alhambra alone can take 8-10 hours to see everything (but you **must** book tickets in advance). Please don't make the mistake of making Granada a day trip. You won't regret it.

Cordoba, for me, is worth a day trip but not an overnight stay. The Cathedral-Mosque is the highlight of the visit. Also take an hour or two to walk through the nearby neighborhoods and see their famous patios. 

We rented a car but regretted it and returned it early. Spain's public transportation is well-developed and reliable. If you're an American, the narrow streets and mopeds may give you anxiety when driving. Unless you want to see some smaller towns like Setenil de las Bodegas, skip the car.

If you do end up staying in Malaga, I absolutely recommend taking a morning bus to Gibraltar. Takes about 90 minutes each way, so you can visit the Rock and see the town in a day. One of the coolest places I've ever visited.",3,2025-04-01 16:03:52,ScarsAndStripes

travel,1jonsbh,ml2ykbv,"So… getting to see the northern lights properly requires a bit of knowledge as to the prime conditions more than location. Think of it as akin to Tornado Hunting. If you’ve ever watched any show documenting storm chasers, you’ll understand how important conditions are…

Essentially you’re chasing three important conditions:

1.) Solar Activity
2.) Sky Cover (Clouds)
3. Bortle Scale (how dark the Sky is)

Alaska Fairbanks University has a website that forecasts Solar Activity. They describe the activity using a scale: KP. 

[Aurora Forecast](https://www.gi.alaska.edu/monitors/aurora-forecast)

KP 1 - 9. 1 being “very low activity”, 9 being “holy shit turn your electronics off solar storm.”

Anything KP 6+ is worth your time. 

As with any forecast, things change as we get closer to the event. So even a great forecast can turn out to be a dud.

The key is to align great forecasts with minimum sky cover (30% or less) at a dependable dark site.

[Light Pollution](https://www.lightpollutionmap.info/#zoom=10.78&lat=47.8964&lon=-90.0268&state=eyJiYXNlbWFwIjoiTGF5ZXJCaW5nUm9hZCIsIm92ZXJsYXkiOiJ3YV8yMDE1Iiwib3ZlcmxheWNvbG9yIjpmYWxzZSwib3ZlcmxheW9wYWNpdHkiOiI2MCIsImZlYXR1cmVzb3BhY2l0eSI6Ijg1In0=)

I live in Minnesota, and I have three dark sites that I monitor for cloud cover on nights that are forecasted to be high activity.

You can monitor cloud cover on your phone of course, or you can use NOAA. I’ve found the latter to be more reliable.

[NOAA](https://digital.weather.gov/)

I would recommend finding a handful of sites you can reasonably access within two or three hours drive.


I say all this because I, too, have been tempted to travel to places like Reykjavik to see the lights. But regardless of how much you pay out how far you go, if conditions aren’t optimal, you won’t be successful.

travel,1jnkn9j,mkqs37z,"Looks like a great trip! Not many people go out to Kinosaki, I haven't heard it mentioned in a while.

Some minor comments:

Shibuya is right next to Harajuku and Yoyogi. Like 5 minutes walk. So I'd change your evening sightseeing around: 

- day 2 - 9 may: Tokyo - Senso-Ji and Sumida River + Skytree, **visit Tokyo tower**

- day 4 - 11 may: Tokyo - Meiji Jingu shrine, Yoyogi park, Harajuku, **evening in Shibuya**

As for the day trips, I don't think you have too many. Day trips are great and help you get to know different sides of the country. Uji might be more of a half day, it's probably the least interesting of the ones on your list. But if you like tea, maybe start early and go out to Wazuka tea fields, then some of Uji on your way back up in the afternoon.

Have a great trip!",2,2025-03-31 20:12:04,NotACaterpillar
travel,1jnkn9j,mkzxjos,"It's a matter of personal preference, but I think you want to maybe blend in a little more rest time. If you're not city people, Tokyo may seem like a lot, because, my guy, it's fuck tons of city. Lovely, crazy, invigorating city, but city none the less. I would heavily recommend the yokochos in various neighborhoods, which are frenetic gatherings of bars that also can seem quite intimate, especially those in Ebisu and Shenganjaya. 


Also, I think you're giving Kanazawa short shrift. It's amazing. Medium city, phenomenal food, and a walkable core. Be forewarned though that the samurai district/geisha districts you could literally see in 15 minutes. Build a day around the river walk, canals and bakeries, and omicha market instead. 


You'll have an amazing time. My wife and I are LITERALLY in the airport on our way home from our first Japan and Asia at this exact moment after lots of European travel, and we've had possibly the best trip of our lives so far. Learn some Japanese if you can, just a smattering, and try it out. It's an amazing country full of kind people, so come in ready to soak it up. The food is unbelievable.

travel,1jmp1tg,mkjytix,"I visited Lofoten Norway last summer and loved it! A few tips/ideas for your trip:

1) You likely know this, but just to be sure, you are planning A LOT of driving, particularly in Lofoten. The weather there seems to change about every 15 minutes and in October, there is a chance of snow which can make driving more difficult. Normally, the weather can get very windy as well. Just want to caution that driving there seemed to take longer than Google maps advertised depending on weather and traffic. 

2) Transportation - If you fly to Bodø first and then take a ferry, the main ferry for your itinerary is [Torghatten](https://www.torghatten.no/en/our-routes/18-782?tab=info). Route A goes from Bodø to Moskenes. You can check the schedules online. 

3) Hikes in Lofoten - Read about the hikes in advance and you might want to have a few different ones on your itinerary. You likely know this already too, but just to be sure, the hiking in Lofoten is difficult and we found the local descriptions of difficulty to be underrated. For context and not to brag, we are a very active mid 30s adults who regularly run/bike/lift and run sub 3 hour marathons. The ""Moderate/Medium"" hikes were pretty hard, think climbing 2,000 ft elevation in 1 mile with no stairs. We didn't get as far down in Reine since we were mainly in northern Lofoten and Vesteralen, but Reinebringen hike is one of the ones you see online the most but can be very busy (maybe not in Oct) and dangerous depending on your ability (check out news stories on deaths there). I would consider checking out Munken hike in Sørvågen near Reine, supposed to be less busy and better views. Near Henningsvaer, check out Mannen hike which we did. It's not too long and has gorgeous views of Haukland Beach. Also, beware of hiking on rainy days or right after it's rained -- the trails can get very muddy and slippery.

travel,1jmgk5r,mkbl458,"On the cheaper end of the accommodation spectrum, you should expect to spend about S$80-100 for one night in Singapore (about 4,000 pesos). Food varies considerably; expect to pay about $10 per meal - more if you get drinks or eat in a restaurant, less if you have a small appetite in a hawker centre or coffee shop.

Transport from the airport to the city: $30 by taxi, or about $2.50 by train/bus. One day of public transit will probably cost no more than $10-12 unless you decide to take taxis or Grab. You can use your foreign Visa or Mastercard debit or credit card; there is a small service fee, but it will be cheaper than buying an EZ-Link card.

Cost of activities is going to depend tremendously. Zoo? Mahal na. But some of the public libraries are very Instagrammable and free to enter. The Singapore City Gallery (near Maxwell Food Centre and Chinatown) is also free entry and worth checking out. Even Gardens By the Bay has a reasonably large free outdoor area - if you are on a budget, don't bother forking out (about $70) for the air-conditioned Flower Dome gardens.

travel,1jkriru,mjz30we,"Interesting post.

I did an overland and sea trip from Australia to Italy, without taking any flights.That took me about 2 years.

My advice would be... leave everything as open and unbooked as possible.Allow yourself time, things always go much slower than you expect.

Also give yourself plenty of time when you are NOT moving.Traveling every day or two gets tiring very quickly.

Then, have more money than you think you will need.Things go wrong from time to time, and sometimes you want to spend more than a minimal budget..no point missing interesting things because you don't have the money to see them.

As Kananaskis mentioned, there are some problematic areas here for sure.I did my trip almost entirely by public transport so can't help you much on the regulations for private vehicles, but it's not easy in some cases.

The hardest thing for me was getting a lift on a private boat (in my case Australia to Indonesia)... that took a lot of waiting, asking around and eventually a lot of luck.

• When leaving the pier, walk down from the pier a bit and then get a drive. The traffic getting out of there is worst than Hell itself.

To uber/lyft from LAX you have to take a shuttle so factor in an extra 15-30 min for that on top of expected traffic conditions. Do your research on where you can store your bags because most airlines won’t let you check in until 4 hours before the flight. US airlines don’t tend to be as efficient with this as international airlines in my experience. 

I wouldn’t spend more than an hour- hour and half tops at the pier. There is always traffic on the 405 to and from Santa Monica. Expect to spend a minimum of 30 min but a max of hour and half to get there depending on traffic, which can change unexpectedly. 

Lastly, I would really only risk it if you have a flight that can be easily rescheduled or is refundable.

There are only a few places where you can actually join the trail, and logistically a 3 day/2 night trek does not make any sense. So the shorter option (2D/1N) is basically joining the trail near Aguas Calientes, hiking for 5-6 hours along the tail end of the trail, then either camping or going back down into town to stay at a hotel. Then the next morning you take a bus up to Machu Picchu and explore that. So it really just depends on how much hiking you want to do and how much of your trip you want to devote to that versus doing other things in the area. In either case, you’ll take the train at least from Aguas Calientes to Ollantaytambo (it’s the only way to get between them). 

I would say that only two days in Cusco (plus the Sacred Valley, which is at a lower altitude) is only barely enough time to acclimatize if you plan to do the full 4 day trek. It’s probably fine if you just do the shorter option. It also doesn’t *really* make sense to visit Ollantaytambo/Sacred Valley as a day trip, return to Cusco, and then immediately retrace your steps to go back towards Machu Picchu",2,2025-04-21 02:29:28,ggrnw27

travel,1k3yuo1,mo7cbbw,"I’m a little confused by your queries regarding a “tour of Machu Picchu for 4D” and “hiking + train.”  Are you looking to hike to MP.  Or are you looking to take a train and hike around a bit while out there. 

If the former, there are “two-day hikes” to MP. Basically, the train takes you like 90% of the way to Aguas Calientes, you get off the train at like km 104, and you hike the rest of the way with your guide. This needs to be planned because you literally just get off the train in the middle of nowhere.  

If the latter, I don’t recall that there were hikes in Ollantaytambo. There are “hikes” as part of some circuits at MP.

As for some of your requests for recommendations:

-Hotel in Cusco:  we stayed at Casa Clara. It’s a new-ish boutique hotel by Annanay Hotels near the Belmont and Inkaterra.  If you’re into walking, it’s just about at the start of the road leading to Sacsaywaman.  We really liked this hotel because it was smaller and the staff was so welcoming.  And it was right next door to the art museum which was open late. 

-Hotel in Ollantaytambo:  we stayed at El Albergue at the train station.  It was pretty cool just needing to walk outside to catch the train. And they watch your luggage while you are at MP.

-Tour Companies:  we went with cuscolocalfriend.com for most things.  They were really great to work with (but, admittedly, maybe a little slow with emails while we were trying to schedule things).  No complaints though. They even helped us create more bespoke plans.",1,2025-04-21 03:53:50,Serious_Method138

travel,1k3y633,mo68trz,"- It’s strenuous, no way around that. I might’ve done more difficult single day hikes elsewhere, but the combination of 4 days in a row of hiking plus the altitude makes it difficult.

- Most hotels in Cusco will store it for you at no charge, especially if you stay there again after the hike
- No power, bring a battery pack and/or solar charger and keep your phone off or in airplane mode to save battery

travel,1k3y633,mo9ao9e,"Hi OP!

The four day Inca Trail was one of the best experiences of my life; I'd say that the trail is almost a greater 'destination' than Machu Picchu itself.

The two day 'Inca Trail' is an access track installed by the Peruvian government which effectively skips the Trail that was built by the Inca.

My two cents are you should either walk the four day trail or just take the train directly to Machu Picchu.

The altitude is no joke but a few days in Cuzco make a big difference in getting you acclimatised.

Porters are mandatory; the groups are all pretty similar. They put us all to shame with the loads they carry and the food they prepare was incredible.

- Anne-Frank house is quite touristy but its worth to visit( better to go early and on weekdays)
- Don’t go to Fabel friet (sorry) its overrated and so crowded. Never heard anyone from Amsterdam saying that they go to Fabel. If you definitely want to go, don’t visit the one in the Runstraat cuz its SO busy. Visit the one on Nieuwendijk or Oude Hoogstraat instead. Much more quiet and also have seats available. For food i recommend Pazzi for pizza,bakkerij wolf for lunch/ breakfast. Gertrude for dinner and smelt is also amazing for dinner 

Hope u enjoy ur trip🩵",4,2025-04-17 13:32:19,Opposite_Forever37

I had long heard about the legendary Chongqing hotpot, so I found a small local restaurant near Jiefangbei that came highly recommended. The moment the bright red broth hit the table, the aroma of chili and Sichuan peppercorns wrapped around me. The steam curled up into the air, and even the atmosphere seemed to carry that spicy, numbing scent.

Tripe, duck intestines, and sliced beef went into the pot one after another. Every bite was intensely flavorful — spicy, numbing, and absolutely addictive. My eyes were watering from the heat, but I couldn’t stop eating. That was when I truly understood what people meant by “painfully delicious.”

After the feast, I hailed a taxi back to the hotel, only to discover that the real “main event” of the night was just beginning. The taxi driver weaved through the overpasses like he was drifting in a racing game. The car shot up, dove down, twisted left and right — my GPS couldn’t even keep up. The roads in Chongqing are a mystery, like a rollercoaster built into the city. For a moment, I honestly wondered if the driver was moonlighting as a racecar driver. I gripped the door handle tightly, half-laughing and half-nervous the entire ride. It was thrilling and hilarious — an experience that could only happen in Chongqing.

Carry your wallet in a front pocket, some cash in the other pocket, passport in a zipper pocket.  Think about getting the pants in a shorter inseam, so they don’t drag and wick water.  Another good thing to wear are long sleeve fishing shirts, these are very lightweight but cover the skin from the sun, dry quickly, can roll the sleeves up and fasten them.  Have two breast pockets, either Velcro, zipper or button, or a mix.  Great for planes and buses as can keep passport there, phone, earbuds, just easy to reach while sitting.

travel,1jzk7fs,mn774wp,"- Go to the winelands. You are missing a HUGE part of the appeal of the region by only staying in the city. I'm the opposite - whenever I go, we will stay in Stellenbosch and maybe only do a single day in the city! Honestly, you could spend a week hopping from cellar to cellar, wining and dining. If you are staying in the city, you might need to organize this through a private driver/charter (which is absolutely fine) but I would encourage getting out there. Personal favorites are Ernie Els and Tokara.  
- Waterfront is ""ok"" (definitely worth checking out for a first-timer, but once you've taken your photos, had a nice meal and walked through a mall that could be anywhere on earth, there's not much there.  
- Take your safety seriously. And by this, I mean that if you are leaving a city restaurant after dark and ""only"" need to walk a few blocks, get an uber. One of the most beautiful countries on earth, but the crime is sadly out of control. Also, don't wear any obvious jewelry and if you have a wedding ring, consider leaving it in your hotel safe. I don't want to scare you or sound alarmist, but it's a constant threat, especially as female travelers.  
- Some of the best food and wine anywhere in the world (and I don't know what currency you're paying, but it will be CHEAP compared to wherever you're coming from). A personal favorite is [Tintswalo](https://www.chefswarehouse.co.za/tintswalo-menu), which not only has incredible food, but [the views to match](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d0539fcae0fa4000173c0da/1695289619104-OL2GZQIX032145RLRGGD/Tintswalo_012221_0048.jpg?format=2500w).  
- Consider a walk up Lion's Head. Depending on your physical condition, it's ""tough"" without being a proper hike and offers some of the best views imaginable. Like anywhere in SA though, have your wits about you, go as a group and try to avoid darkness. We set off around sunrise and it was majestic.  
- I've been to Cape Town a lot, but I've never actually been up Table Mountain and am not really bothered. To me, the mountain is what you want in the view from wherever else you are! I might one day, but I can think of ways I'd prefer to spend my time than to wait in long cable car queues. If you decide to go, ensure you check the official website/social channels, because weather is a HUGE factor (either when it comes to winds causing closure, or fog/clouds completely covering the view). It's one of those activities you don't want to pre-book and just see how it looks on the day.  
- Loadshedding happens, but they (usually) tell you in advance, and it's (usually) only a few hours at a time. Still, it pays to ensure your portable phone charger is juiced at all times.  
- Buy a sim card at the airport on arrival. There are kiosks in immigration who will get you set up and sim installed (companies like Vodacom). Super cheap and definitely your best option.  
- Credit cards are widely accepted, but it pays to have a bit of cash. Just draw some from an ATM using your debit card.  
- I'd also check out the South Africa and Cape Town subs to see some more local recommendations for things to see/do/eat etc.

Clyde's drive in across the bridge from Mackinaw is a good food stop if you enter/exit the UP from that direction. Definitely stop for pasties somewhere, we did Jean Kay's pasties in Marquette and Roy's pasties in Houghton. Stop at Jampot if you head up towards Copper Harbor - absolutely delicious baked goods and preserves made by monks, it's a very unique destination.

There's lots of great hiking. In Marquette we hiked Hogback mountain and visited Presque Isle Park. In Copper Harbor you can drive the Brockway mountain drive and get a great view of the lakes from the top. 

Visit some of the mines if you can. Delaware copper mine  near Eagle Harbor is cool, it's a self guided tour that takes you all the way down into an old copper mine that is partially flooded. Lots of steps down and back up though. Quincy Mine north of Houghton is a good stop if you head north from there, it's more of a museum and very informative.

I think the biggest challenge for your itinerary in October/November is that you will have to go around the Sierras to get to Yosemite. If you do you should visit Joshua Tree and Death Valley along the way. Maybe Los Angeles and San Diego too. I would recommend doing both Sequoia NP and Yosemite but I can see the argument for skipping Sequoia... but you can still kinda like drive through it if nothing else, it isn't a huge detour from Yosemite.

I personally would choose ""west"" or ""east"" of Vegas - if you choose ""west"", do stuff in SoCal for all the rest of your time. If ""east"", then go to Grand Canyon, Zion, and whatever other parks in the four corners states. You won't be able to do both unless you skip a lot of very beautiful places that will be near some of your stops.",2,2025-04-13 05:35:28,mtg_liebestod

travel,1jxmc62,mmrpldo,"California is an incredible place with so much to see. In my opinion, the best way to experience the state is by car as there’s such a wide variety of natural beauty that you can't really experience unless you drive (or take a bus tour). As the other poster mentioned, doing a trip with others would save on gas, rental car and accomodation. If you're outdoorsy, camping at the national parks would be cheaper than hotels.

Given the current geopolitical climate, many foreigners aren't travelling to the U.S., and there are growing concerns about increased border security and the possibility of tourists being detained. Whether those concerns are justified or not, it’s something worth keeping in mind as you plan your trip. Canadians have to start registering with the U.S. government if they'll be in the country longer than 30 days, not sure if it's the same for Europeans.",1,2025-04-12 18:02:18,jyeatbvg
travel,1jxmc62,mms8k1v,"Some general pieces of advice, beyond hitting up the major urban attractions:

- In terms of nature definitely check out Yosemite, Death Valley, Joshua Tree, Sequoia, and Coastal Redwoods NPs. My favorite ""hidden gem"" is Fern Canyon near Coastal Redwoods NPs. It's not California but consider adding Crater Lake as well if you're traveling far north. The other NPs are nice but missable (although the foxes at Channel Islands NP are adorable.) Some of these places will vary significantly though depending on season, I would try to hit them in Spring/Fall.

- If you plan on going east of the Sierras (Joshua Tree NP and Death Valley NP) consider adding Las Vegas to your itinerary. Although once you do that, you can also consider adding the Hoover Dam and Grand Canyon too.... gotta cut things somewhere I guess.

- I recommend doing as much of the PCH as you can. Consider doing a big road trip loop from say San Diego -> Las Vegas -> Death Valley -> Crater Lake -> Eureka -> PCH all the way down to San Diego, covering LA and SF too. Skip the central valley except insofar as you need to in order to visit Yosemite and Sequoia NP.

- I personally think Salvation Mountain / East Jesus is a really neat destination as well, near Joshua Tree.

- It definitely would be better to share the experience with others.",1,2025-04-12 19:46:41,mtg_liebestod
travel,1jxmc62,mn6oais,"I'm sure there's group trips available but renting a car is probably your best bet. You'll have maximum flexibility that way and be able to get around cities and to the National Parks and beaches. 

A good itinerary would be to fly into LA or San Diego, then head north to San Francisco checking out parks like Joshua Tree, Death Valley, Sequoia, and Yosemite along the way. Yosemite is spectacular and very popular - reserve campsites well in advance. Redwood NP is also beautiful but quite a bit further north. 

Big Sur has stunning coastline along iconic Highway 1. It's not a national park but you can visit state parks like Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park and Andrew Molera State Park. Pfeiffer beach has purple sand and you can see coastal redwoods in this area. 

Please take care to have your travel documents in order at the airport. America has sadly been going through unpredictable and disorganized immigration crackdowns. That said, there's been a notable drop in travel here so you may be able to find good deals on hotels and airfare. 

One of my favorite trips ever was a 12 day roadtrip through San Francisco, Yosemite, Sequoia, and Big Sur. There are so many outstandingly beautiful places to see in California, it's easy to get overwhelmed. Pick a few key cities and nature spots and then plan your trip around those.

Then down the coast to Tulum (or wherever you're staying, staying between Tulum and Coba sounds smart) and on to Bacalar and back to Merida. At that time Playa del Carmen was the most beautiful place on the coast, but now it's so overrun with tourists, I think you're wise to skip it.

Chichen Itza is stunning, large, and crowded. Get there early and ignore the souvenir guys with the jaguar whistles. I wouldn't count on visiting additional ruins, since you'll probably be tired.

We stayed in kasane around july 2008 and did a game drive and a river boat trip.  Both were good but the river boat was more fun.  The early game drive was absolutely freezing.

We then went to maun and organised a scenic flight, which was hot but could see hundreds of animals.  We then did a 3 day canoe camp trip from maun.  That was the most fun, camping in the delta - albeit only on the edges of it because the boat trips don’t go very far in.  Saw plenty of animals and the delta was rising.  It was great being just us, 2 guides and another couple on the island.  We did walking trips looking for game and poled around in the canoe.  We heard elephants chomping in the night nearby but didn’t actually see any - were weren’t bothered because we’d already seen heaps in other places. 

We were told by locals that the further into the delta you go the better it is, but all of those fly in/fly out camps were very expensive and we were travelling on a very tight budget.

One of the highlights was on the bus from kasane to maun - it stopped in the middle of the highway because a leopard was siting by the side of the road.

travel,1jv6gaf,mm93930,"No, that itinerary is not reasonable. Here is what I’d suggest: 

Allocate 3 nights to Porto, with one day trip to Aveiro. There’s a train from Porto that’ll get you there in 2 hours or less and Aveiro really doesn’t have that much to do that you need more than a day there. 

Spend the next 3 nights in Lisbon. But on the day that you go to Lisbon, take an early Flixbus to Obidos, explore as a day trip, then continue on to Lisbon. 

Once you’re in Lisbon, take a day trip that includes both Sintra and Cascais. Explore castles in Sintra during the day then head to Cascais in the later afternoon for a bit of exploring and have dinner there then go home. 

If you insist on still doing Evora, that only leaves you with one day in Lisbon and it deserves at least 2.",2,2025-04-09 18:08:43,busylilmissy
