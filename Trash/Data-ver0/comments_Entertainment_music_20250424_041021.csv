Comedian and musician Reggie Watts attended Coachella last weekend, and his experience was pretty dismal: too expensive, too much trash, too many brand activations and influencers, and not nearly enough soul, respect, and community spirit. He even likened the attendees to “walking credit cards.”

The festival just concluded its first weekend this past Sunday, and Watts has offered a review on social media. “I’ve been to Coachella a handful of times now, and while the scale is impressive, the soul feels increasingly absent,” Watts wrote on an Instagram post titled “Coachella Thoughts.” “The experience is confusing and impersonal — checkpoint after checkpoint, wristband logic puzzles, security everywhere. Most people on the grounds move like walking credit cards, pinging from one branded experience to the next,” he wrote.

He continued: “There’s no real sense of love coming from the festival toward the people. No care. No reverence. Just vibes curated for influencer culture. You’ll catch glimpses of something real — an artist pouring their heart out on stage, a sudden moment of connection — but those moments are fleeting. They’re easily lost in the chaos, buried beneath the logistics, the brand activations, the overpriced everything.”

Watts then turned to the amount of trash left behind at the festival, and why exiting Coachella can be particularly dismal. “And then there’s the waste — plastic, garbage, trash in the desert wind. Leaving is especially grim. You’re navigating dust storms, people hustling to buy your wristband, and a general sense that it was all a transaction, not a shared experience. If you’ve got asthma or care about your breathing, bring a mask. Seriously.”

He concluded his missive by championing independent festivals instead: “There are better ways to do this. There are independent festivals run by people who give a shit — about the music, the artists, the fans, the land. They treat performers with care and build environments where real community can take root. That’s where the magic is. That’s what’s wort supporting.” See Watts’ post below.

Watts raises some important questions about large, multi-genre festivals and their sense of community (or lack thereof), as well as their environmental impact. Last year, Consequence staffers discussed the changing festival landscape in a roundtable chat, and in 2023, we spoke with festival organizers large and small about what it would take to hypothetical build a carbon neutral festival.",905,2025-04-16 16:23:54,YoureASkyscraper

He tells WIRED he made the decision after seeing President Donald Trump’s executive orders targeting the trans community, including one proclaiming the US government will only recognize two sexes, male and female. He’s also been increasingly fearful after hearing stories of visitors, US visa-holders, and applicants being held at the border, including a Vancouver woman who told the Guardian she was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for two weeks.

Trump, I may be one of those returning to America who is barred or put in jail to sleep on a cement floor with an aluminum blanket,” Young wrote. “That is happening all the time now.

music,1k2w9gd,mo0rm2r,"Nobody will read this but… having worked backstage on the main stages two years running with six acts… here’s why Coachella gets more tech issues than ACL or Lollapalooza. Coachella’s simulcast on YouTube is now more important to acts and their teams than just about any other performance. As such pop/hiphop acts pull out all stops just for this festival. And I don’t mean a few more backing singers and a few more lights. I mean giant, complicated, Hollywood backlot-style sets. Not just the six headliners either, anyone playing after 4pm is bringing in four semitrailers and a 20 man rigging crew. These acts are totally comfortable blowing $800k on one performance while making a net loss cos in real terms it’s a justifiable marketing expense (see: Beyoncé’s $2m extravaganza). 

Backstage at Coachella was always hectic but now it’s a logistical nightmare, huge sets jampacked together, leaving very little space for pre-micing things like drum kits. It’s like the Pepsi halftime show and universal studios for 16hrs a day. Acts also frequently add surprise guest performers with their own mic/IEM systems so there’s another crucial tech element to incorporate. 

The end result is that most acts are rocking a much more complicated setup than they would anywhere else, with a million moving pieces that are difficult to get on/off stage, and mostly cannot be soundchecked in advance. Playback systems with live autotune. Dancers with RF packs, thousands of channels of wireless audio. Million dollar lighting rigs. LED screen content built into sets. Despite having the best tech crew in the world, fuckups are just about inevitable. 

And any audio person will tell you… headset mics are just a fucking nightmare. I thought gagas performance was a technical triumph. And yet one tiny moment that most people in the audience missed results in this headline.",293,2025-04-20 01:14:54,dale_dug_a_hole

Two months later, in February 2024, Merton says, Kanye requested to use her tune through BMG Rights Management, but she rejected it.

>1995, Yolanda Saldivar was convicted of Murder with a Deadly Weapon and sentenced to life in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice-Institutional Division. She was required to serve 30 years before becoming eligible for parole consideration. Her parole eligibility date is March 30, 2025, meaning that she could be released no earlier than that date.

>As with any other initial review of an offender for parole, approximately six months prior to her parole eligibility, she went into the parole review process. An Institutional Parole Officer prepared her file for submission to the parole panel responsible for rendering the discretionary decision. Within that confidential file there is a plethora of information including but not limited to: court documents, offense reports, support/protest information, criminal history, institutional adjustment and information/statements provided by the offender. The file was then sent to a parole panel of three. A simple majority was required to either grant or deny parole.

>After a thorough consideration of all available information, which included any confidential interviews conducted, it was the parole panels determination to deny parole to Yolanda Saldivar and set her next parole review for March 2030. The reason provided by the panel for denial was the Nature of the Offense: The record indicates that the instant offense has elements of brutality, violence, assaultive behavior or conscious selection of victim’s vulnerability indicating a conscious disregard for the lives, safety, or property of others, such that the offender poses a continuing threat to public safety.",98,2025-03-27 23:23:05,DemiFiendRSA

None of their employees liked her, nor did Selena's family. She basically acted like she owned everything, going over Selena's head to fire employees and controlling their finances. It was soon discovered that Saldívar had embezzled $30k from the businesses, and so Selena's dad fired her on the spot. However, she still had control of all of the financial documents. Selena tried to get them all back, but Saldívar dragged her feet the whole time to avoid giving them up. She even went as far as to *fake being raped* (yes I am fucking serious) to guilt trip Selena into dropping it. Eventually, Selena decided enough was enough and point blank demanded all the papers. And Saldívar responded by shooting Selena in the chest, calling her a ""bitch,"" and driving away in her truck.

music,1k4ano8,mo942og,"I think this trend is inevitable for a lot of things where someone is looking for ""good enough"". You see it in EVERYTHING from background animations, background images, to icons, to sprites for video games. You can just use AI and bypass both paying and having to deal with copyright issues. Human made is quickly becoming a premium luxury, like free range chicken and eggs, or organic fruit. 

I just don't see any escape. Everyone's incentives are just bad for human made stuff when AI will do. If you are a solo creator of some flavor, or even in a team with minimal exposure and money, AI is an irresistible and cheap shortcut. 

It won't be long before AI will be making the backing tracks for aspiring singers/rappers because it means they can create without hiring anyone. AI is going to make the images and sprites for indie game makers because it means drastically less time and money spent on art assets that normally would require going back and forth with an artist you need to pay. Writers will use it as an editor to get their first books out. Once AI video gets good, indie writers and director will use it for their actors because it means they can create without dealing with real human actors, sets, and all that jazz. Think of how many anime nerds are going to do their own anime by using AI because they can't draw but want to tell a story they normally would have no ability to make. 

The most hopeful interpretation is that this will enable individual creators to make things they normally couldn't because it that's skills that don't have; so the anime nerd that wants to tell a story but can't draw, or the writer that wants to do a movie but doesn't have the social and business skills to deal with a full production crew.

This is even worse when it's shown that it's easier for bands to perform in other countries that aren't the US. I agree that international bands performing in the US should be considered cultural exchange and that it should be cheaper and more efficient for them to be able to perform in the US. 

Also, it's not that surprising that international artists are choosing to not perform in the US due to our current international relations. When someone comes into the US, it's easy to tie them up with ""visa issues"" given how much red tape there is. Moreover, artists songs and personal opinions seem be playing a part in some artists losing their visas, like shown with Los Alegres Del Barranco's. Like, at what point is American market worth the amount of jumping through hoops only to be told, ""no"", detained for an uncertain amount of time, and then sent back home.

By the time VS came along, PJ had ditched the big reverbs and (most of) the stadium guitar tones.

To me, Vitology is where they had finally shaken off any vestiges of the rock era that preceded them.

music,1jl5erb,mk8f9xh,"There is no dispute that, at age 34, Michael Jackson slept more than 30 nights in a row in the same bed with 13-year-old Jordie Chandler at the boy’s house with Chandler’s mother present. He also slept in the same bed with Jordie Chandler at Chandler’s father’s house. The parents were divorced. So far, five boys Michael Jackson shared beds with have accused him of abuse: Jordie Chandler, Jason Francia, Gavin Arvizo, Wade Robson, and Jimmy Safechuck. Jackson had the same nickname for Chandler and Arvizo: “Rubba.” He called Robson “Little One” and Safechuck “Applehead.” Jackson paid $25 million to settle the Chandlers’ lawsuit, with $18 million going to Jordie, $2.5 million to each of the parents, and the rest to lawyers. Jackson said he paid that sum to avoid something “long and drawn out.” Francia also received $2.4 million from Jackson. Michael Jackson suffered from the skin discoloration disease vitiligo. Jordie Chandler drew a picture of the markings on the underside of Jackson’s penis. His drawings were sealed in an envelope. A few months later, investigators photographed Jackson’s genitalia. The photographs matched Chandler’s drawings. The hallway leading to Jackson’s bedroom was a serious security zone covered by video and wired for sound so that the steps of anyone approaching would make ding-dong sounds. Jackson had an extensive collection of adult erotic material he kept in a suitcase next to his bed, including S&M bondage photos and a study of naked boys. Forensic experts with experience in the Secret Service found the fingerprints of boys alongside Jackson’s on the same pages. Jackson also had bondage sculptures of women with ball gags in their mouths on his desk, in full view of the boys who slept there. According to the Neverland staff interviewed by the Santa Barbara authorities, no one ever saw or knew of a woman spending the night with Michael Jackson, including his two spouses, Debbie Rowe or Lisa Marie Presley. Rowe, the mother of two of Jackson’s children, made it clear to the Santa Barbara authorities that she never had sex with Jackson. The parents of boys Jackson shared beds with were courted assiduously and given myriad expensive gifts. Wade Robson’s mother testified in the 2005 trial that she funneled wages through Jackson’s company and was given a permanent resident visa. Jimmy Safechuck’s parents got a house. Jordie Chandler’s mother got a diamond bracelet. Two of the fathers of those who have accused Jackson, Jordie Chandler and Wade Robson, committed suicide. Both were estranged from their sons at the time. In a 2002 documentary, Living with Michael Jackson, Jackson told Martin Bashir there was nothing wrong with sharing his bed with boys.",3,2025-03-28 19:06:45,erotic_jesus

He plays it much straighter now than he did when he joined in the 90s. But he plays professional and clean, keeps good time to the click track that holds the score together and sounds fluid.

Armchair diagnosis is that Daltrey is losing his hearing more seriously than before and for years he blamed stage volume. Now they turned that down for in ear monitors and electric drums to tour with an orchestra. And then he blamed the monitor mix. His solo shows have the same thing, he's mad at the monitor mixer.

But I think the biggest difference is looking at the producers of their first two solo albums.

JT had a list of superstars, neptunes, timbaland.  JC not so much.   Don’t knock how much producers elevate music.  And timbaland is a magician",1087,2025-04-05 22:42:15,MrAmishJoe
music,1jsepab,mllvpfm,"JCs first album was all over the place. Justin also either through luck or smarts went into the exact kind of music that was getting hot then which was more hip hop themed. 


I also think JC is really more about wanting to control things. Where Justin much more, he'll do what's asked of him. Like his first record is a Timbaland allium basically and the second is a Pharell album. I think that makes him very easy for producers to work with. 


Obviously the Britney stuff also helped. 


JC is better vocalist but his voice sounds better  a capella than on a track imo. His tone really isn't great for highly produced stuff. Whereas Justin's lighter voice can really just float over heavy beats etc.  Again probably why producers like working with him. ",955,2025-04-05 22:07:35,Ill_Assumption_4414

The music, the documentary, his 20 hour 2016 audiobook that he reads himself. He spent seven years writing the book ‘Born to run.’ I suspect this is part of that process. I really can’t recommend his book enough, it is so thoughtful and introspective and you can tell that years of therapy have helped him understand what makes him tick. 

His need to create was the thing that really drove him, it was just tunnel vision. My favorite part is when he writes about the Super Bowl halftime show. I’m sure Patty’s cancer must be incredibly difficult too. He really doesn’t know what to do with himself if he’s not on stage and he readily admits that. It will be interesting to hear this music. He is not called the Boss because he’s a great musician, he’s known as the Boss because he makes every decision about the band. He mentioned that this is the opposite of how U2 work.

Touring with Devin Townsend was off to a hilarious start when we received a notice from his tour manager of bus and tour rules. If food is present backstage, Mr Townsend must be allowed to finish eating before anyone else can approach the table. If you are seated and Mr Townsend enters the room you must offer your seat to him. If Mr Townsend asks for water or a towel and you are in possession of either you will immediately relinquish that towel or water. Then he came on the tour bus and it turned out it was all a practical joke. We were expecting this absolute bastard and got the sweetest, warmest, most amazing guy ever.


Queensryche were a horrible band to open for. I had always loved them but they went out of their way to sabotage our set. Wouldn't let us set up our instruments on stage, but then wouldn't let us set them up backstage either and carry them up because we'd be making too much noise near their dressing room (we hadn't started yet). We didn't get to soundcheck because Queensryche didn't want any noise while they were preparing for their set. So...

* Speaking with [*TIME* in a cover story](https://time.com/7277722/ed-sheeran-interview-time100-2025/) for its TIME100 List on Wednesday, April 16, Ed Sheeran reflected on the years-long saga — prompted by his song's similarities to the 1973 Marvin Gaye classic ""Let's Get It On"" — and the ways in which it affected him.
* For a while, Sheeran, 34, felt like other songwriters were treating him like a “piggy bank, where people can just shake it,” he said. Once they legal proceedings were over, “everyone's left me the f--- alone — and the freedom really just lifted a weight.”
* In November 2024, Sheeran persuaded the court to uphold their decision in a copyright appeal case, arguing that he did not infringe the copyright of Gaye‘s sensual hit. Per [*Billboard*](https://www.billboard.com/pro/ed-sheeran-beats-lets-get-it-on-copyright-case-appeals-court/), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said that the pair of songs share only “fundamental musical building blocks” that cannot be owned by any individual songwriter.",87,2025-04-17 15:52:09,peoplemagazine

You are not God, judge, jury or executioner.
If you don't like it, cool. But, no one cares about your opinion, or what you find irredeemable.
So stay away from Brand New. And the shows, and the music.

>In a new interview with The Bitter Southerner, Shannon opened up about his love for R.E.M. and performing their songs — even if he’s not a fan of actors moonlighting as musicians.



>“I kind of walked away from \[songwriting\]. Because, if nothing else, it just seems kind of greedy,” said Shannon, who previously fronted the indie rock trio Corporal. “It’s like, how much good fortune can one person expect to have in their life? I’m not a fan of actors having rock and roll bands.”



>Still, he described his performances of R.E.M.’s music as “glorified karaoke.” 



>“Karaoke is, you know, on the one hand kind of an embarrassing ridiculous thing. But on the other hand, it’s an extraordinarily beautiful, moving thing that allows anybody, literally anybody, to go up on stage and sing a song that they love and sing it with as much passion or however the hell they want to sing it,” he explained.",143,2025-03-26 22:26:42,cmaia1503

>We Finally Buried the Hatchet!!!

>I went to see @eltonjohn perform on SNL this weekend!! WOW.
I remembered when I was in high school- I snuck out of the house one night to see Elton perform live in Detroit! It was an unforgettable performance that helped me understand the transformative power of music.

>Seeing him perform when I was in high school changed the course of my life. I had always felt like an outsider growing up and watching him on stage helped me to understand that it was OK to be different-to stand out- to take the road, less traveled by. In fact, it was essential.
>Over the decades it hurt me to know that someone I admired so much shared his dislike of me publicly as an artist. I didn’t understand it. I was told Elton John was the musical guest on SNL and I decided to go.

>I needed to go backstage and confront him . When I met him, the first thing out of his mouth was, “Forgive Me” and the wall between us fell down.

>Forgiveness is a powerful tool. Within minutes. We were hugging.
Then he told me had written a song for me and he wanted to collaborate. It was like everything came full circle!!

music,1jwst8t,mmkxfd8,"> There was no alcohol in the studio at any time because we didn’t want to put pressure on Warren. So believe it or not, we were sober when we did that. We drank around him once because I was reading a detective novel set in Miami and the characters went to a place called Harry’s Stone Crab Legs. I was talking to Warren and said, “I don’t even know what a stone-crab leg is. I want to get some stone-crab legs.” He goes, “I know this place out in the Valley.” So we went up to the Valley, and three of us R.E.M.-ers had a couple of drinks. Nothing untoward — we all kept an eye on Warren.

> Warren was driving, and honestly, I shouldn’t have had the drinks. There was a belly dancer there too. It was that kind of night, meaning it ended at about 7:30 p.m. and Warren got in his car and left to do whatever he did at night — fight crime or who knows. He passed away so you don’t have to worry about this, but don’t ever get in the car with that fucker. The worst driver I’ve ever been with sober. I can’t imagine what it was like when he was drunk.

music,1jipw3z,mjhmky9,"In my younger days I was exclusively a metal head with no appreciation for music outside of that genre. One day I was on a long drive and my now-wife didn't care for the CDs I had so we compromised on a rock radio station. It was late at night, traffic was light on the road and she was asleep in the passenger seat. The quiet darkness and monotonous gentle rumble of the car had me lost in thought as I was driving along, but then the song that was playing softly on the radio caught my ear. This gravelly voice over a sad piano that felt like it needed to be heard. As the second verse of Tom Traubert's Blues started I felt instantly transported to the world of the song, I'd never known a song to paint such a vivid picture and I was just lost in it and as I got sucked in I found myself tearing up for no apparent reason, I was just so engrossed in the song and it lit something in my soul. The song ended and the journey continued but I couldn't get it out of my head. 

&nbsp;

It was almost like a religious awakening, I had found this song and songwriter and I needed more. I went to the local music shop and bought the Small Change album and that was the start of my new musical journey. I needed more of this music - songs that told stories of the human condition, of life and loss. Here in Ireland we have an annual music festival of sorts called 'Other Voices'. It's a series of small intimate concerts (mainly performed in a church in a town called Dingle), and the acts vary from the very famous such as Amy Winehouse to the smallest Irish acts getting a platform. It gets broadcast on TV and I'd highly recommend watching some performances on YouTube. Anyway, one night not long after this car journey I was watching Other Voices on TV and this Irish songwriter called Mick Flannery came on and he was introduced as having won a songwriting competition judged by Tom Waits, so that instantly caught my attention and he went on to perform his song and again I was sucked into the story of the song, the gentle piano and the distinct voice. I had to hear more so I looked him up and found he was playing in a local theatre a few weeks later so I bought tickets. During that show he introduced his song that had been judged by Tom Waits, it was called 'In the Gutter' and I thought it was utterly brilliant, and then following that he said he had a tribute for Tom and went on to perform 'Martha' immediately after. I actually broke down during that song, it was just sadness and heartbreak that I'd never heard in a song before.

&nbsp;

That was back in 2010 and since then I've discovered so many brilliant songwriters, I write music myself now inspired by that kind of style, I've been to countless live shows of songwriters, and I own most of Tom's discography on vinyl that remain in heavy rotation. I owe Mr. Waits a massive thank you for opening my eyes and ears to the incredible songwriting that exists in the world. That one song on that quiet night drive completely changed my life musically, and I wouldn't have it any other way.",12,2025-03-24 15:10:58,lumpymonkey

From the literal first note, the place went dead quiet. By the time she got to the first chorus, people literally stopped on the street to watch her sing.  It felt like actual magic, like she was a siren or one of those spirits that draws you into the woods. And then she went back to the corner of the bar, had a good night with her friends, did a few more songs throughout the night, and it was awesome.

I love that she got to have a normal night out and the everybody else had a night they'll never forget. It's like that M Bison line in street fighter.",513,2025-04-05 16:52:52,itspeterj

Yeah, they have managers and lawyers and such but, they can move on after the flop. What music artists have always needed was a reliable union. Many have been attempted, but none gained any traction. If there was a union demanding that artists get paid more, have health insurance, have time off instead of touring relentlessly to pay the label back, etc than labels would have to meet a minimum standard for the artist. 

Unless things change, in many respects, the industry will remain the wild, wild west. Those who have the power will continue to have that power unless they are forced to relinquish it to meet a set standard.

music,1jq5iiw,ml588ep,"Former major label artist here. 

The advantages of being able to take out that loan and get into that environment are many. In our case, we got to make our albums to a pretty high standard, work with good people in expensive facilities. 

This is not just a luxury like the food there is better. To really have the budget to not cheap out and rush through everything was a great advantage compared to indie label budgets. We made those albums sound like we wanted and did not get interference. If we were having a moment of success in some part of the country we could go do gigs there. We got booked on some good tours through that association. 

We got dropped after the second album and it was a bummer to realize they weren't going to promote what I thought was our best work. But when we left, we could have signed to another label if we had the gumption to stick it out.

Doing everything yourself, as I do now, is another thing entirely. I don't get to hire great designers, I do flyers in PowerPoint cuz it's loaded on my work computer. Our latest release, we produced a whopping 100 copies. But, we've nearly sold them out and the future looks.... Doable. I miss the PR staff I could call and harangue for not doing enough to make us famous. But we carry on. 

I think you could look at a lot of bands and say the industry did them dirty, way worse than what happened to us. You could also look at Metallica, Nirvana, GNR and see examples where the bands really became who they were with a little bit of funding and development, and got some rewards in the end. Listen to Bleach and ponder... What if that band was stuck with those production standards for their whole career? They might not have been able to get Dave Grohl to fly out from DC to audition if they were gonna be on Sub Pop their whole lives, couldn't have afforded it. 

I'm an unlikely apologist for big labels, that was a four year blip in a near forty year career and it was surreal to live through. But what I'm saying is, it was both blessing and curse. Just like the indie labels I work with. A mixed bag of opportunity and limitations. Maybe the fact we never made a lot of money meant we got off easy.

music,1jq5iiw,ml4t12d,"It’s exploitative, but it’s not a scam. The labels tend to be greedy and take more than what seems fair, though.

In the vinyl era through the CD era, you couldn’t become a famous recording artist without signing with a label. Without a label, you wouldn’t have gotten on the radio, you wouldn’t have gotten into the record stores, and you wouldn’t have a career selling out stadiums. The idea is that the band makes money playing live, and the label gets almost all the rest of the money.

Nowadays it’s possible to build a following on YouTube and streaming services, but you’d also have to create your own music videos and record and produce everything yourself.

As for why successful band members run out of money, that’s easy. A lot of them are bad with money, and/or they treat their band’s income as if it’s a steady job that they will have until their 70s or 80s. A lot of bands that start off very successfully end up only having 1 - 3 good albums and fall off. Those with more financial savvy invest their money and live modestly in the early years so that they’ll be financially secure no matter what, but many prefer to buy expensive cars, jewelry, fly in private jets, etc. If their success slows down or stops, they wind up with no savings and they’re broke.",17,2025-04-03 02:06:07,TheLegendTwoSeven

* Five years after revealing her [harrowing abduction experience](https://people.com/music/duffy-rape-stripped-me-of-my-human-rights-kidnapping/), the Grammy-winning singer has [popped up on TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@emotion.hq/video/7485816448837897494) to help promote an upcoming remix of her hit song “Mercy.”
* In what appears to be her first public appearance in 10 years, Duffy, 40, lip-syncs along to a line from her 2008 breakthrough single before winking at the camera as the beat, remixed by e.motion, kicks in.
* The singer released her debut album *Rockferry* in 2008, and won the Grammy Award for best pop vocal album. Her second album, *Endlessly*, came in out 2010, though she left the public eye shortly after. In February 2020, Duffy revealed the reason for her lengthy absence from the spotlight: [a devastating ordeal](https://people.com/music/singer-duffy-raped-drugged-held-captive-days/) some years earlier in which she was raped, drugged and held captive.",66,2025-03-28 15:34:06,peoplemagazine
