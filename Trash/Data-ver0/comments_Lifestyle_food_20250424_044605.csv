food,1k3rpgc,mo4dhng,"A family favorite, easy to make & grill. Highly recommended. I've been able to get galbi / kalbi beef on sale from the local grocer fairly regularly. And while I prefer thin cut kalbi / galbi, I like discount prices even more. With the thick cut, these were marinated overnight in a favorite kalbi / galbi sauce before cooking on the grill.

Enjoy & have a great weekend.

food,1k4mu7w,mobm25l,"I quickly wrote down a recipe as well. I hope some of you end up trying it!

**Ingredients**

* 200 g ground beef
* 1 small white onion, diced
* 3 garlic cloves, minced
* 2–3 peppers (red/yellow/green), chopped
* 2 medium potatoes (≈300 g), peeled & cubed
* 200 g diced tomatoes 
* 2 Tbsp oil + 1 Tbsp butter
* 2 eggs
* Salt, pepper, 1 tsp paprika, ½ tsp cumin

**How I do it**

1. Heat 2 Tbsp oil in a skillet over medium‑high. When it shimmers, add beef in one layer.
2. Let it brown untouched 1–2 min, sprinkle salt/pepper/paprika/cumin, stir 30 sec, then scoop into a bowl.
3. In the same pan, melt 1 Tbsp butter. Add potatoes, onion, garlic, peppers, season lightly, and cook 5–7 min until potatoes get golden bits.
4. Stir beef back in with 200 g diced tomatoes. Bring to a boil, lower to medium‑low, cover, and cook 12–15 min until potatoes are fork‑tender.
5. Crack 2 eggs on top, cover, turn off the heat, and let sit 5 min so the eggs steam‑cook. Season the eggs with smoked salt, pepper and smoked paprika once cooked.",2,2025-04-21 21:08:59,mrcookswell

food,1jtqizr,mlw789w,"So, not really a meal, but I thought I'd share:

\- Had 8lbs or so of spare onion - I have a bad habit of loving a good onion deal, what can I say!

\- Prep was easy. Chop the head, split, skin, chop the root end, roughly slice them (""against the grain"" of course)

\- I decided to salt them a little. For the 8lbs, I think I added about 2-3 tbsp of pink salt. I also added a good dose of liquid smoke (wanted to see the effect, it's very subtle; have to revisit the strategy).

\- Started my dehydrator at 155F, but about 6h in or so (honestly can't recall), I knocked it down to 120F. They were actually starting to roast a bit lol. Which is fine! It made them turn out a bit better than expected. The whole process took about 40h total.

Uses: they're awesome for tons of different stuff. I like blitzing them in my spice grinder for a nice, sweet onion kick in my seasonings. I've used them in rice. I rehydrated them to make onions for burgers. And actually, they eat a lot like a chip - they're really tasty just on their own lol. But ya, it's just a great way to avoid waste and use product you would otherwise throw away. The same can be done across a LOT of different veg. I've done it with peppers (awesome for making chili!), tomatoes (flavour bombs!!!), even pickles (good for a pickle flavour in a dressing or a seasoning). I wanna try zucchini and parboiled carrots to make homemade dry soup mix.

Recipe.

2 can red kidney beans

1 turkey breakfast sausage tube

1 turkey sausage ribbon

2 bay leaf

Onion

Garlic

Salt

Pepper

Paprika

Garlic and onion powder

Rice

Oil

Dice garlic and onion and add to pan with some oil and sautee. Once colorized add turkey sausage and brown.

I grilled the sausage ribbon and then cut into slices and added to the pan with the turkey sausage. Cook together and add two cans of beans. Simmer with bay leaf until liquid thickens a little. Season with salt and pepper paprika garlic and onion powder to taste.

Server over rice.
—————————————————————————————

The orange stuff is my habanero sauce recipe 


Lacto fermented habanero sauce/salsa



1 lb habanero peppers (any peppers)(destemmed you can deseed if needed I don’t.)

1 large white onion (sliced to fit through mason jar opening)

1 whole garlic bulb 

1 large red bell pepper (or any color but green bell)

24 grams Canning salt 

1 quart cool Filtered water 

1 - half gallon wide mouth ball jar

Dark room temp location for 10 days



To do:

Wash all peppers. 

Peel garlic and add to jar

Slice bell pepper into slices that will fit into jar I usually cut into 8ths. 

Slice onion same way to fit through mouth of jar

Add habanero to jar 

Top with glass puck and press if needed to acquire more space. You want to leave about a half inch to inch in the top. 

Mix salt and water together until salt dissolves. Pour brine into jar until it covers the glass puck. 

Seal with ferment lids and use pump to remove excess air from jar. Place in a dark, room temp location undisturbed for 10 days. You can peek at the jar and see if there are bubbles forming and floating to the top. This means it’s working! Just don’t open it! 

After 10 days remove lid and assess. If done properly there may be some white film residue or what appears to be sea foam on the sides. This is a byproduct of some fermentations and is called Kahm yeast, perfectly harmless and naturally occurring. As long as there is no color (green, black) the mold can be wiped away. 

Strain the fermented pepper mix to over a large bowl and collect the fermented brine. Add the pepper mix to a blender. (Watch the fumes they’ll gas you) blend and slowly add more brine to reach the desired consistency. You can save any left over brine and add cucumbers to make some spicy pickles or what ever you want.  


Refrigerate after bottling. Serve chilled. Do not cook the salsa as it will lose any probiotic value. Chilled shelf life at least 6 months. But I have never had it last that long. Shits good yo.",2,2025-04-01 01:27:27,t-o-m-u-s-a

food,1k0sjwd,mngldzz,"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.

Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Beat brown sugar, 1/2 butter, with an electric mixer in a separate large bowl until smooth. Stir in eggs and mashed bananas until well blended. Stir banana mixture into flour mixture until just combined. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.

Use 1/4 cup butter, brown sugar, splash of vanilla, chopped pecans and mix together making a crumble.

Bake in the preheated oven for 50 min, pull bread out, put crumble in the center of your loaf, spread maple syrup around top of loaf. Bake another 10 min until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 60 minutes total.

Let bread cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.

Slice, add a small dab of sweet cream butter, smear and enjoy 🤤",3,2025-04-16 19:23:09,nessa_s

food,1jo8s22,mkpzbj8,"Key aspect of Hong Kong French Toast:

1) Utilize the soft sliced bread (similar to the soft bread slice from Japan)

2) Use them to form Jam sandwich. Traditional dictated the use of Kaya (Coconut) Jam, but some use peanut butter, and one hotel in Hong Kong use marmalade. Personally I prefer Kaya

3) Deep fried

The only thing where I am 50/50 is whether to slather it with Golden Syrup or Condense milk. I prefer Golden Syrup.",4,2025-03-31 17:49:16,Jestersage
