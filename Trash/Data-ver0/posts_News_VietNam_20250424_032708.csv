VietNam,1k4v14u,Looking for a tattoo artist in HCMC (or Hanoi) who specializes in Japanese-style black & grey work,"I’ll be in Vietnam for a month and I’m hoping to find a tattoo artist in Ho Chi Minh City (open to Hanoi too) who specializes in traditional Japanese-style sleeves—particularly black and grey work with waves, clouds, and lotus/peony flowers. Similar to the works in the photo. 

This would be my first tattoo, and I’m planning to get a sleeve. I’m female with fairly small arms, so if that affects how long the process might take or how many sessions I’d need, I’d love to hear your thoughts.

If anyone has artist recommendations (IG handles/facebook page preferred) and a rough idea of what something like this might cost or how many sessions it could take, I’d really appreciate it.

Thanks so much!

My trip is pretty loose but right now its fly into Hanoi fly out of HCMC a month later, with plans to see Sapa/Ha Giang (doing the moto loop), camp in Khe Sang, stay with family friends in Hue, and see a silk factory in Hoi An. I am thinking there will hopefully be something in those towns or in between that call to me, but just wondering if anybody has any specific ideas for a wedding present from Vietnam that would be fitting. For context if it helps:

* Both are mid twenties
* She is a yoga instructor who is interested in holistic medicine

""Phan Hiển Đạo (1829 - 1883), người làng Vĩnh Kim Đông, tỉnh Định Tường, nay là thành phố Mỹ Tho. Ông đỗ tiến sĩ năm 1858 đời vua Tự Đức, là người tài hoa, giỏi âm nhạc.""

**Direct English Translation:**  
""Phan Hien Dao (1829–1883), from Vinh Kim Dong village, Dinh Tuong province (now My Tho city), passed his doctorate examination in 1858 under the reign of Emperor Tu Duc. He was a talented person, especially skilled in music.""

Phan Hien Dao (1829–1883) was an important historical figure in the Nguyen dynasty, known for his talents and extensive knowledge. He was born in Vinh Kim Dong village, Dinh Tuong province (now My Tho city). In 1858, during the reign of Emperor Tu Duc, he earned the title of Doctor, affirming his position in the country's academic and intellectual circles.

Phan Hien Dao was not only skilled in literature but also a talented musician. His works contributed to Vietnam’s cultural heritage during a time of great social and political change. Although the country faced challenges under French colonial pressure, his artistic and academic achievements reflect the resilience and creativity of Vietnamese intellectuals of that era.

Phan Hien Dao’s life and career left a lasting legacy in Vietnamese history. His cultural contributions continue to be remembered as a testament to the vibrant intellectual and artistic traditions of the Nguyen dynasty.

VietNam,1k2v7r3,Lost Passport in International Mail – Any Advice or Similar Experiences?,"Hi everyone,

I'm hoping someone here might have experienced something similar or can offer some guidance.

About a month ago, I had a newly issued European passport shipped to me while I was traveling in Vietnam. The passport was sent from Portugal with a tracking number. On the last tracking update, the letter passed through the UK on its way to Vietnam—but since then, there have been no further updates. Vietnam Post doesn't have the tracking number in their system.



So far, I've taken the following steps:

Contacted UK Border Force, in case the letter was intercepted at a postal import hub there.

Contacted Vietnam Customs, asking whether the item may be held or delayed on their end.

Contacted Portuguese Customs, in case the passport was never properly dispatched or got held up before leaving the country.


Filed an official complaint with CTT (Portugal's postal service) using the Livro Vermelho (their official complaint system).


The passport contains no visa or sensitive insert—just a standard new document—but I’m now in limbo with no clear idea where it is or who might have it. I’ve provided all relevant details, including the passport number, to the authorities mentioned above, and I'm currently waiting to hear back.

Has anyone else experienced a similar situation with an international passport shipment getting lost or stuck in transit between countries? Any tips or ideas on what to do next would be hugely appreciated.

VietNam,1k2syc2,Digital Nomad Couple  - coming to VT for 40 days - Last week of May / All June. Where should we base ourselves?,"**Looking for Advice: Nha Trang vs. Da Nang (or maybe near Hoi An?) for Remote Working Couple in Our 40s**

Hey everyone,

I've gone down the Reddit rabbit hole and read pretty much everything I can find about Nha Trang and Da Nang, but I still have a few final questions I'd love some input on from the hive mind! 😊

We’re an Australian couple in our 40s, currently slow-traveling and working remotely (posting this from Sri Lanka!). We’re not on holiday in the traditional sense—we’re still working full-time while trying to build a healthy, sustainable lifestyle as we move around.

We’ll be leaving Sri Lanka soon (visa limits), and I’m looking at Vietnam as our next base—ideally for at least a month or two.

# What we’re looking for:

* A **quiet**, comfortable place to live and work
* A **solid daily routine** with a good gym, healthy food, and a bit of exploring
* Definitely **not into the party scene**—we’re 90% sober, so nightlife isn’t a priority
* Walkable area preferred, with access to cafes, gyms, and decent groceries

# Weather:

According to ChatGPT (and other sources), it sounds like **Nha Trang has better weather** this time of year, while **Da Nang can be hit or miss with rain**. That’s nudging me toward Nha Trang, but I’m open to being convinced otherwise.

# About Nha Trang / Da Nang:

* I keep reading about the ""Russian invasion"" in Nha Trang—kind of like the Dubai Marina or Bali vibes? If it’s just a lot of tourists and a few tired buildings, we can manage that.
* We’re *not* looking for beachfront luxury—just a **quality apartment in a quiet area**, near food and gyms.
* Any thoughts on avoiding buildings like Gold Coast or Panorama in Nha Trang? I’ve seen complaints about overcrowding, elevators, and disrepair—reminds me of some high-rise issues in Dubai.

# Also considering: somewhere just outside Hoi An?

Is this a viable option for remote work and daily gym access, or would it be too quiet / inconvenient?

**So my main question: Based on all this, where would you base yourself—Nha Trang, Da Nang, or near Hoi An? And which specific neighborhoods or buildings would you recommend for a quiet, health-focused lifestyle?**

\*\*Thanks to chatGPT for helping me clean up this post \*\*

I am trying decide what to do for stay June 28-July 1st. Deciding between booking two basic rooms at either Capella or Sofitel Opera Wing with FHR benefits. The Sofitel is cheaper, however, I am betting on hopefully getting upgraded to a basic Heritage room which on the website appears to be one category higher than the basic opera wing room.

The Capella is approximately 60 USD more per night. Worth it? Or Sofitel? Not sure what to do. Any advice would help.

Other stays prior to arriving in Hanoi are:

\- Six Senses Ninh Van bay

\- Amanoi

\- Intercontinental Danang Sun Peninsula

\- Anantara Hoi An vs Four Seasons Nam Hai

\- Azerai La Residences Hue

\- Deciding on staying overnight in the middle of our stay in Hanoi to stay at Tam Coc Garden (June 29-30 whilst Hanoi stay is 6/28-7/1) to visit Ninh Binh rather than an exhausting day trip \*this is why Stay 3 Pay 2 at Capella is a bit more enticing, yet still cheaper than paying the nightly rate at Sofitel.

VietNam,1k22ma9,"I Regretted Signing Up, but the Gym Is Keeping My Deposit for 90 Days","
I recently went to California Fitness for what they advertised as a free 30-day trial.

But when I arrived, I didn’t get to try anything. Instead, I was sat down and sold to for the entire session by a staff member. They told me to come back the next day for a “free personal training” session to try things out properly.

On the second day, I went for what I thought was just a trial PT session. The trainer reassured me there would be no sales. But after the session, a staff member sat me down and tried to sell me a 24-month membership installment plan. I refused, clearly said I wasn’t ready — then they brought out another staff member to pressure me again.

After intense pressure, I caved and gave a 6 million VND deposit, thinking I’d just go home and cancel if I felt unsure.

But when I tried to cancel (the same evening), they said I needed to do it in person. When I returned, they told me no refunds, and offered to convert the deposit into 8 PT sessions instead. They also claimed they had already opened a loan for me with Sacombank before 7PM — even though I hadn’t signed anything for that.

Eventually, after more pushing, they said they’d refund my money — but it would take 90 days.

I’ve received zero services, signed nothing with the bank, and now my money is being held hostage for 3 months. I feel tricked.

Is this legal in Vietnam? Has anyone experienced something similar? What can I do to get my money back sooner?",2,1.0,2,2025-04-18 11:27:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1k22ma9/i_regretted_signing_up_but_the_gym_is_keeping_my/,Tab_brickyPh

VietNam,1k1jwfq,Poland vs Russia on Facebook: Who’s rewriting WWII history?,"

I came across a Facebook post where the Polish Embassy and Russian Embassy are going at it over WWII history. 

Link here if you’re curious:https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1Chzgz4obU/?mibextid=wwXIfr


(*) Poland claims the USSR helped Nazi Germany secretly rebuild its military after WWI—citing joint training centers for tanks and aircraft in Soviet cities like Kazan and Lipetsk, all starting with the 1922 Treaty of Rapallo. They say Russia now uses ""fighting Nazism"" to justify the war in Ukraine.


(*) Russia fired back, saying those programs ended in 1933, and that Poland actually signed a pact with Hitler in 1934—implying Poland was no less cooperative with Nazi Germany.


I’m no history expert, but a few things stood out:

- Poland’s post feels like they could do better in listing the facts and examples. From the museums and research I've read, there are more solid facts for them to prove their points. The one from this post seems a little bit weak.


- Most Vietnamese commenters sided with Russia and called Poland the traitor.


- A lot of arguments of Vietnamese people in comment section came from school textbooks, which feels a bit one-sided. History, especially war history, needs more than just one narrative.
-> That's is the reason for this question.


- I’ve talked to some European friends into history, and they said Russia’s been playing the aggressor card in the region for a long time—even pre-WWII.

-> It suggests that Russia has never been a reliable ally, and that’s why neighboring countries have always felt the need to band together—like joining NATO today—to protect themselves from its influence

=> So here’s my question to people who study history or just know their stuff:
- What’s your take on Russia and Poland’s roles before WWII?
- How were you taught this part of history—especially if you grew up in Vietnam or outside the West?

Genuinely curious how the narrative shifts depending on where you’re from. Again, I am not a history savvy, enlighten me with your knowledge.",2,0.55,37,2025-04-17 18:24:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1k1jwfq/poland_vs_russia_on_facebook_whos_rewriting_wwii/,Significant-Pick4526

VietNam,1jwp1lq,Cost of Notarisation,"I plan to leave for Vietnam from the UK in August, and to spend a few months in Vietnam / other SEA places, using proper visas etc. I then plan to get a teaching job in HCMC with my CELTA (I'm from the UK, which means notarisation can't be done in Vietnam). 

My question about the costs of notarisation is to see if I should pre notarise the original documents in the UK, send the originals back from Vietnam myself via DHL courier or something similar, or keep the originals at home and have a parent sort the notarisation for me and send them to me in Vietnam.

  
I would hesitate to do it before I leave, as I may end up not getting a job before the 6 months validity is expired. This could be my own doing as I want to continue the travelling, or maybe I just flunk some interviews. And then the other two is a matter of cost I imagine.

I'm not intent on doing the process the cheapest way possible, just the easiest (if budget options are also available that's great).

I like cities, and the food, and generally, just walking around and seeing amazing Vietnam doing its thing.

I’m trying to figure out if this trip will be doable weather-wise or if it’ll just be exhausting due to heat and humidity. I’m okay with warm weather, but I don’t want it to ruin the experience.

VietNam,1jsijzr,HCMC Apartment Hunt: District 9 vs. Thu Duc for Our Young Family - Need Your Wisdom!,"Hi everyone,

My wife (Vietnamese), our 7-month-old son, and I (English) are looking to buy an apartment in Ho Chi Minh City with a budget of around 4 Billion VND. We've narrowed down our search to a few areas and would really appreciate some advice from those familiar with them.

We've looked at apartments in The Origami and Beverley Solari in District 9 (Grand Park), as well as Opal Garden and Opal Riverside in Thu Duc.

One of the main attractions of District 9 for us is the potential for more space and slightly cleaner air, which we think would be great for our young son as he grows up. However, the distance from the city center is a definite consideration.

In Thu Duc, we liked some of the Opal developments. A significant point is that the apartments in Opal Garden come with a ""pink book"" (sổ hồng), which as a foreigner, gives me a greater sense of security alongside the sales contract. However, we found that Opal Riverside does not currently have pink books.

We're trying to weigh the benefits of more space and potentially better air quality in District 9 against the closer proximity to the city center and the peace of mind of having a pink book in Thu Duc (Opal Garden).
Our main questions are:

 * For families with young children, which district (District 9 or Thu Duc) do you think would be more suitable and why?

 * Does anyone have experience with the Vinhomes Grand Park (The Origami/Beverley Solari) or the Opal developments (Garden/Riverside)? What are your thoughts on these projects and the surrounding areas?

 * Specifically regarding the ""pink book"" situation with Opal Riverside, does anyone have insights into why some new developments might not have them immediately and what the potential risks or timelines could be? Is it something we should be significantly concerned about?

 * Considering our budget of 4 Billion VND, are there any other areas or specific apartment complexes we should be considering that might offer a good balance of space, convenience, and legal security (like having a pink book)?

Any advice or personal experiences you can share would be hugely appreciated as we make this important decision for our family.

Thanks in advance!",2,0.75,9,2025-04-06 01:07:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1jsijzr/hcmc_apartment_hunt_district_9_vs_thu_duc_for_our/,Maximum_Procedure310

30 yr old female living in the US and am looking for any and all advice you have for someone traveling to vietnam for the first time.

Should I start from north or south Vietnam?
How many days to spend in each town? 
Popular or not so popular things to do?
Any scams I need to be aware of to avoid?
Airlines to stay away from? 
Overnight bus recommendations?
Can I use credit card only or cash? 
Backpack or suitcase? 
Do I need vaccinations/shots/medicine for travel? 
Are there a lot of laundromats? 
Can I wear jewelry and purse on the streets? 
Spa recommendations


Lastly, I want to give back and donate during my trip. Are there any orphanages or schools I can go to donate?

First, [have a look at our old sticky threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ASticky). A lot of useful information there. A lot of questions have been answered.

VietNam,1jog3uc,"Northern Vietnam - Sapa vs Ha Giang, Mai Chau vs Cat Ba","Hi all,

I'm travelling around Vietnam for 1 month in April/May and could really use advice. I'll be flying to Hanoi with my boyfriend and travelling Northern Vietnam with him for 2 weeks, before he flies home from Hanoi Airport. Then I'll be joined by a friend in Hanoi. My friend and I plan to do the 3 day Lan Ha Bay cruise together, before heading to central Vietnam for a week, then flying out of Ho Chi Minh Airport. I'm struggling to decide how to fill the 2 weeks with my boyfriend.

The provisional plan I've drafted is:

* Day 1-3: Hanoi
* Day 3-8: Ha Giang Loop (and travel to Ha Giang)
* Day 8-11: Ninh Binh
* Day 11-14: Mai Chau/Pu Luong OR Cat Ba Island

I'm hesitant to spend more time on Cat Ba Island because I'll be doing the 3 day Lan Ha Bay cruise later that week. However I haven't seen much on Mai Chau/Pu Luong online so I'm not 100% committed to it.  
  
I'm also interested in Sapa and the Phong Nha caves but both seem like they'd involve a lot of additional travel. I think we'd like to keep to 1 major bus journey (6 hour+) as our flight over will be very long.

Lastly - does anyone have any recommendations for decent Vietnam travel guides? Generally everything I've seen so far has been from people who did the classic '2 weeks North to South Vietnam' trip, which doesn't really suit my slightly slower, more Northern focused trip.",2,1.0,2,2025-03-31 22:27:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1jog3uc/northern_vietnam_sapa_vs_ha_giang_mai_chau_vs_cat/,arthur-russell
VietNam,1joc2o9,Migrants From Pondicherry (French India) to  L'Indochine and Saigon,"Hello, I am tracing my ancestry of my relatives in history. I believe I may have one relative from the early 1900s that made their way from Pondicherry (French India) to L'Indochine (French Indochina) by ship. They were brought by the French government to work in an administrative role. Logic would probably put the person in what is modern day District 3 of Ho Chi Minh City, as this is where Saigon's India Town was located. 

Is their any archive that I could research to better understand the genealogy of something like this?  I have a person's name, when the left Pondicherry, and perhaps when they landed in a coastal are near Saigon... guessing they landed at Cap St Jacques in L'Indochine...modern day Vung Tau, Vietnam. 

If there is anyone that maybe has an idea what archive I could look at, please advise... Either Vietnam or France.

We live in Hoa Binh city now, which is great, but we are getting air pollution from Ha Noi. 

I've visited Hoi An before (not the super touristy bits, mostly An Bang homestays etc). We love the slower pace there compared to the pretty intense Ha Noi outskirts. 

But, to the point: is it pleasant to drive from Da Lat to Nha Trang for a short holiday?  And from there on, upwards to Hoi An? I'd obviously want to break the drive up to five times, but don't have unlimited time off. So I've been wondering which the best parts are to bike, and which would be better off bussing?

VietNam,1jmfofp,Question about where to find burial of French soldier in Can Tho?,"Hello, I am not sure if this is the right subreddit to ask this but it seems there isn't really any other major Vietnam  related subreddit that I could find with someone that might help. Let alone one having to do with the Indochina War. 

So one of my relatives (Raymond Traumann) was a French soldier in the French Army in the 6e RIC of the 9e DIC. Him and his unit landed in Cochinchine in December 1945 to fight against the rebels (as they called) them and take back Indochina. In January 1946 he was killed in an ambush (it seems in the general Can Tho area) along with an adjutant next to him Luttenhaner, and they were brought back to Can Tho where he was buried in a cemetery next to his comrades where they had a funeral service. This information comes from a [letter typed up](https://wwii-archives.org/index.php/File:144_-_Lettre_du_Commandant_du_Crest_en_Indochine_de_l%27arm%C3%A9e_fran%C3%A7aise_concernant_la_morte_de_Raymond_Traumann_le_23_Janvier_1946.pdf) by his commanding officer commandant du Crest. 

As far as I am aware Raymond's body was never sent back to France and stayed buried in Vietnam. Unfortunately doing while some research I can't find any info about French military personnel buried in Can Tho (maybe the Military Cemetery in Can Tho but it seems that is mainly VC). 

So I was curious if anyone had any information about whether he could still be buried there, moved to somewhere else, or be pointed to somewhere/someone who would know.

Sorry to put it under travel but I couldn't find skincare.

I’m helping my mom look into some non-surgical facial treatments and we came across *Phòng Khám Quốc Tế Mega Gangnam* in Vietnam. Has anyone here heard of them or been there?

She’s particularly interested in:

* Face massage treatments that lift and tighten the skin
* Eyebag reduction without surgery

Just wondering how legit the clinic is — like, what’s their reputation? Are the treatments effective? And is it worth the price?

I’m traveling to Vietnam from the end of April until May 13th, and I’m looking for some itinerary advice.

So far, I’ve booked a hotel in Ho Chi Minh City for the first 3 nights, then I’ll be flying to Da Nang on April 28th. From there, I haven’t planned anything yet—open to suggestions!

I’m especially curious about where to be for the April 30th (Reunification Day) and May 1st (Labour Day) holidays. I know these are big national holidays, and I’d love to be somewhere with either unique local celebrations or just a good vibe—whether that’s fireworks, festivals, or even somewhere more chill to avoid the big crowds.

Would it make sense to stay around Da Nang/Hoi An for the holidays, or should I try to be somewhere else (Hue? Hanoi? Somewhere more off-the-beaten-path)? After that, I’ll have around 2 weeks to explore more of the country—north or south, I’m open!

For context, I’m into nature, culture, food, a bit of history, and scenic spots. Not really into clubbing or party scenes, but open to cool local events or experiences.

VietNam,1k5b829,"Vegetarian/Vegan Translation Help Beyond ""tôi ăn chay""","Hi! I'm about to travel to Vietnam and have been looking up the best ways to get around as a vegetarian. I found so many helpful tips on this subreddit that I'm super grateful for. 

For situations where I can't find a vegetarian restaurant, I wanted to have a bit more robust way to explain what I can/cannot eat. 

**I was wondering if anyone could help me translate the following:** 

* Was this made with fish sauce, shrimp paste, animal fat, or a broth made with meat or seafood? 

* I cannot eat anything cooked with a fat, stock, or sauce made from fish, shellfish, chicken, beef, pork, lamb, goat, or anything with eyes 😬 

*(bonus for vegans who find this thread: it may be helpful to add honey, dairy, and eggs to the lists above)*

* Does this have shellfish in it? I am allergic to shellfish. *(for my husband, who does eat meat)*. 

Maybe it's a bit much, but as a lifelong vegetarian, I can definitely see being in a situation where I say ""tôi ăn chay"" and they think picking chicken out of the soup will be enough for me to eat it. 

I've struggled to communicate this even without a language barrier, so I feel like it would be super helpful to have these translations.

Thank you SOO much! <3 

  


**I'm positive Google translate is wrong, but this is what I got there:** 

* Món này được làm bằng nước mắm, mắm tôm, mỡ động vật hay nước dùng nấu từ thịt hoặc hải sản?

* Tôi không thể ăn bất cứ thứ gì được nấu bằng mỡ, nước dùng hoặc nước sốt làm từ cá, động vật có vỏ, gà, bò, lợn, cừu, dê hoặc bất cứ thứ gì có mắt.

VietNam,1k4vlat,Friendly discussion about Vietjet delay,"So you guys have all seen a lot of posts recently complaining about Vietjet delay.

When T3 in Tan Son Nhat Airport is open and it only serves VJ and VNA customers. Do you guys think that the delay will end? Or will the problem persist regardless?",1,1.0,7,2025-04-22 02:29:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1k4vlat/friendly_discussion_about_vietjet_delay/,kicktaker

My wife is Vietnamese and usually when something upsets her, she tends to do this silent treatment. Not complete silence but, almost ignores you.

VietNam,1k48gsl,Going to Sapa on November,"For starters my mom and I are from the Philippines, she wants to experience a colder weather being tropical girlies but we are tight on the budget.

We will be going on the last week of November, trip will be 7-8 days, starting on the 22nd. 

Will Sapa be worth it? This will be my mom’s 3rd out of country so I think she won’t mind touristy places because she doesn’t get to travel a lot, she is turning 54 btw. 

Priority is for her to relax and feel cold. 

Trip will be Manila - Hanoi - Sa Pa - Hanoi - Manila
