fitness,1jmgxy4,mkdhua4,"TL;DR: I am *shook* by the immediate action my local LA Fitness took after word vomiting at the Personal Training Manager on how disappointed I am about this location. Moral of the story: Don't be afraid to speak up about broken equipment - even little annoyances that aren't that big of a deal.



Apparently my membership was randomly ""upgraded"" and I was eligible for a free assessment (aka sales tactic to get me to sign up for PT). I turned it down, and the PT Manager responded with something to the effect of, ""Okay, we just want to make sure you're getting the most out of your workouts and are happy with the gym."" I responded, ""Oh I'm definitely not happy with this gym."" I proceeded to share how I feel like this location is run down and not being kept up very well (there are ""Scheduled for Service"" signs on damn near everything for weeks at a time, sometimes longer) and that I've been considering going to the LAF 5 miles away.  

I asked if the staff make a point to periodically check all the machines to ensure they're in working order. He said they only fix machines when a member reports it. This makes sense because the damn 5 lb. add-on at the lat pulldown machine has needed lubricant for several months and causes major drag if you use it. Nobody's going to take the time to say anything when they can just go grab a 5 lb. plate and carry on with their workout.

After sharing specific examples of broken things at the gym, I apologized for ranting as that was not my intention. He thanked me for the feedback and said he'd share it with the Ops Mgr. I didn't believe him given this gym's track record and shitty online reviews, but it felt good to get that stuff of my chest.

**Literally the very next day,** I noticed three non-LAF people with notepads inspecting every single piece of equipment. Within 72 hours, all the broken paper towel dispensers were fixed. By the end of the week, I saw actual maintenance folks working on the machines 🤯 

I kinda want to make some protein cookies or something for the PT Manager lol. That was some really amazing follow-through!",126,2025-03-29 16:12:55,squogg
fitness,1jmgxy4,mkcxzmk,"Went to grab a towel and sanitizing spray at the same time as an elderly man; made eye contact, smiled, gave a polite hello as one does. I go to grab one of the spray bottles and he gives me a stern look and says:

“That’ll be 25 cents.”

Playing along with his game, i tell him forlornly, “Shoot, I don’t have any change. Do you take Venmo?”

He raises an eyebrow and says, “I take credit card!” Then immediately starts cracking up like it’s the joke of the century. I start laughing too and tell him he’s got a great business model, then he gives me a big smile and tells me to have a wonderful day.

fitness,1jmgxy4,mkdl2zr,"A couple of months ago, I posted here about doing box jumps at the gym. At the time, I was doing 30 inch jumps, and stacked the boxes for a 36 inch jump. Although it was only a six inch difference, the 36 inch box height looked shockingly high and intimidating compared to the 30 inch box height, and I promptly restacked the boxes to 30 inches.

A redditor here, u/[Icy-Emu-2003](https://www.reddit.com/user/Icy-Emu-2003/), challenged me to try it, just one jump at 36 inches. I promised that I would work on it.

Two months later, I am happy to report that I did it! This week, I was feeling particularly good after doing my box jump sets and decided to go for it. To my surprise, I did it. I felt as if a mental barrier was lifted and I did it two more times.

A couple of days later in the week, I was back in the gym for leg day, and tried it again. The mental barrier now lifted, I did it again five times. Some guy who was working out in the same area, gave me a thumbs up.",46,2025-03-29 16:30:37,cyclingthroughlife

Always within personal space, but I continue to be polite and hold doors for him till exiting the building.


On the last door he says ""you'll have to start charging me for all this!""  ... immediately disarmed me with the dad joke and I wished him a goodnight with a laugh.

Still confused, I’m like “sure you can do a deadlift with it, but it’s on a fixed path so it could be somewhat restrictive.” As we walk to the machine, she stops and said, “no not that machine, that one over there!” She’s pointing to the squat rack with the deadlift platform.

fitness,1jrxsxn,mliwlce,"I usually work out at 4:30 AM, but the other day, I came in around 9 PM. The gym was pretty dead except for a handful of people and a few regulars I recognized from the morning crew.

I'm at the cable row station when this guy comes up to me and goes, ""Hey, you want something to drink?"" I shake my head and say no thanks, I just wanna work on my set. Then the guy goes, ""I can tilt that vending machine over real quick and get us some free drinks."" I kinda laugh it off and say thanks, but I have a water bottle, I'm good.

So I get back to my set, thinking maybe this guy was just hitting on me or something, when the guy turns to the other guy doing pushdowns at the cable station next to me and goes, ""Hey bro, wanna drink? I can flip over that vending machine and get us something for free.""

Pushdown guy was like, ""Nah man, I'm good,"" and the guy fistbumps him and leaves.

I watch this guy from the corner of my eye. Bro is jittery af, he's like bouncing around really manic, and he goes up to everyone in the gym asking if they want a drink and then saying he can tip over the vending machine. Finally, one of the gym staff goes to talk to him, and he's like, ""I can tip that vending machine over in the parking lot and we can get lots of drinks for free!"" and the gym staff guy is like, ""Really? Bro what you lift?"" and he gets jittery guy in an animated conversation. By the time I'm finished with my accessories, the police have come, and they're escorting that guy out, while that guy is cheerfully chatting and offering them tipped-over vending machine drinks.

Edit: lol I forgot to include the best part. So the gym staff member is distracting him by asking him what he lifts, and the guy goes, ""I got one plate, then two plates, then three plates, then BOOM!"" and he thumps his chest and bros out, marching back and forth by him.

So I, weighing in at around 1/3 of what they were lifting for reps, fuelled by the white-hot rage of a woman scorned by her own reproductive system, stalked after them and asked them if they intended to clean up their disaster zone. I reminded them what basic gym etiquette is. They were stammering and hanging their heads by the end of it like chastised toddlers. FFS. Big enough to lift a small car but not a single brain cell.

fitness,1jzn7a6,mnfqvy6,"Few things I think could use emphasis, more important for oly lifting but apply pretty broadly

* I think people can over-emphasize stretching/mobility, but a good general warmup including dynamic stretches is excellent for performance and injury prevention, and it's something a lot of people neglect. If your shit is hurting, you may not need to do anything more than a bit of activation work in your warmups to get everything firing.

* Address your injuries proactively - you shouldn't be feeling sharp pain while you're training, if you are something is going wrong and you got to fix it. Fixing it doesn't mean taking time off (although that may be part of it), but it does mean figuring out why your knees/shoulders/etc. are being over-stressed and addressing the root cause. This doesn't mean you have to freak out about every little ache/twinge but it does mean you need to stop popping ibuprofen like tic-tacs instead of seeing a physio that works with lifters/athletes

* Consistency is really all that matters for strength training, both in recovery and in training, so quit fucking around with your programming/exercise selection/micronutrients if you're missing gym sessions or not getting your protein in every day. Any mental energy spent determining the perfect bicep curl variation to use is far better spent finding ways to ensure that you get all your programmed work done.

* Related to the above - I think the best high-level approach to training is to make things as easy as you can on yourself so that you can stay consistent. Find ways to make training as fun as it can be so you show up and get your work done, and avoid trying to implement habits that are difficult to maintain and have marginal positive impact. The former for me was just making training more social/finding a good training group so that I have that accountability structure/have more fun in the gym hanging out with folks, and the latter for me was just not over-committing to excessive volume/not being too draconian with nutrition.

A couple years ago, I started with nSuns' 5/3/1 4-day spreadsheet and modified it to 5 sets instead of 9 because the bench volume wrecked my elbows. 

I also added a section below to track accessory lifts and have packed the spreadsheet with a ridiculous number of features, formatting, formulae, and data validation, as well as a separate sheet to track your weight over time. It automatically calculates BMI, normalized FFMI, body fat % using various measurements, push:pull ratio, how many reps to do at a higher weight to ensure you're lifting at least the same total weight, etc.

* Dips: hit 4x80 lbs added PR (BW ~191 lbs)
* Chin/pull ups: 135/125 lbs added 1RMs
* Squat: 325 lb 1RM pr followed by 225x16 rep PR (probably could have done at least 2 more but felt like I'd pass out)
* Some random exercises: glute ham raise with 40 lbs x 8 reps, 45 degree back extension with 175 lbs x 8 reps,
* Maxed out the gym's dumbbells (120 lbs) for DB rows and had to start adding kettlebells to it
* Maxed out a few machines like leg extension, plate row, for a lot of reps

Home-Made Sour Pickled Cabbage/Leafy Greens

Ingredients:

- Cabbage (or whatever other leaves you want)
- Water
- Salt (2% of the combined weight of water + cabbage)
- A food-safe container large enough that the cabbage doesn't fill more than 3/4 of the volume
- A plate, which also fits in that container

Recipe:

1. Wash your hands. Wash your utensils. Wash the cabbage. Do not wash the salt.

2. Peel a few whole leaves off the cabbage and save them. Chop the cabbage into small pieces (your choice, I tend to go for double bite-sized)

3. Weigh the chopped cabbage. Measure out 2% of that weight in salt and add that in. If you can't weigh your salt refer to the notes at the bottom.

4. Mix the salt and the chopped cabbage thoroughly in the container. Your grandmother would use her hands for this don't be scared.

5. Put the plate (which you cleaned, remember?) on top of the salted cabbage. Stack enough other objects on top of the plate to press the cabbage down.

6. After a few hours the cabbage should have wilted a little and there should be salty leaf water in your container. Add enough water to cover the cabbage, making sure you track how much was added. Add 2% of the extra water's weight in salt. If there's enough cabbage sweat that it's already fully swimming just skip this step.

7. Use the cabbage leaves saved at the beginning of the recipe to cover the chopped cabbage. Press everything down into the salt water. The goal is for all the vegetables to be fully submerged.

8. Let the container sit covered and unrefrigerated for 3-9 days in a dark place. Check every day, push the leaves back under the water and taste the water for sourness. It will be ready to eat faster in a warmer climate. Store in refrigerator when you are satisfied with the taste.

Notes:

- The water should be like a too salty soup; drinkable but not good enough to serve to your family

- Fermentation is a live process. You will know it's working after 2-3 days when the leaves regularly drift above the water's surface and bubbles appear when you press them back down

- You can add other vegetables. Other kinds of greens, cucumbers, peppers, onions, garlic, etc.

- If you notice new colors, new objects, or bad smells in your cabbage it has spoiled or grown mold. The exception is garlic, which will turn blue or green when fermented. If the color spreads to the other vegetables then the garlic is also bad

- The longer you wait the more sour it gets. Keeps in the fridge for a few months, I wouldn't store it outside for longer than 2 weeks at a time",1,2025-04-01 22:28:46,qpqwo

So far, I’ve been finding whey protein recipes, and it looks like whey protein binds much much better than pea protein.

I can trade a cashew cream recipe that helps with any rice or potato dish, even steamed potato and kale.

200g cashews

Couple of tablespoons of yogurt of your choice (I can’t do cow, so I do goat, it works fine, soy works fine too)

Juice of half a small lemon (just over a tblspoon)

Just over a tblspoon of apple cider vinegar

Salt to taste (a pinch works fine, 2 tastes better but isn’t necessary)

Soak the cashews overnight. If you are in a hurry, just bring water to a boil, stop the fire, dump the cashews in the water and wait 20min.

Blend everything.

You can add chives and parsley for taste.

I do these things in bulk, so I don’t add fresh garlic as it becomes very pungent after a couple of days, but if you have a few mouths to feed, garlic certainly adds taste and micros.

I do this over packaged cream cheese because can’t do cow and can control salt. Macros are dominated by cashews, so above 70% fat, and then roughly 15% prot and carbs, so go easy on it, but it can really help if you are trying to bulk and looking with despair at your rice and greens dish at the end of your day.",1,2025-04-01 20:12:35,Tom_Barre

fitness,1jysqut,mn29c9t,"Hey guys,


since it's Monday, I got two questions that might be moronic:


1) how much does cutting affect your lifting weights and performance? So far, I've been able to keep my weights and reps, some I could raise slightly, but moving them becomes harder and harder, and I need more rest between sets.


2) how important is clean eating for losing fat and getting to see them abs? I've been cutting before, so I know CICO works, but I'm not the cleanest eater and fear it might affect my goal. E.g. I haven't eaten today yet, and was thinking of treating myself to Asian buffet or even Burger King (love that whopper) after my workout today. Alternative is hitting a store and buying some stuff for cold dinner (cheese, meat, bread), as I'm staying in a hotel all week (no water heater or stove available)

I am not looking to get any stronger. A secondary goal would be maybe losing a little fat as a result of the addition of cardio, but I'm not seriously trying to cut weight.

Few questions -

If I start doing cardio can I keep eating the same I've been eating (4k calories, around 170g of protein daily) or will I have no choice but to eat even more to maintain my strength/lifts and muscle mass if I'm burning more calories?

Joined a new gym recently where they made me do this test. Upon seeing the result the trainer told that you dont eat enough and dont drink water enough but on the contrary I have a good decent appetite and eat more than average (taking the average of people around me). 

My gym journey : 
- Was super skinny at 176-177 cm height and weight was around 51-52 kg when I started in December
- Now height is same and weight is around 58kg. Do not look as skinny as I started before but still long way to go. 
- Supplements taken - Protein and Creatine

Does my BIA test result normal or are they in any form concerning. If so then any sort of help or advice is welcomed.

My bf tries to go to the gym 6-7 days a week. He‘ll often be there between 2-3 hours, sometimes longer. He will do functional strength exercises like Turkish get ups, and lifts with 40kg+ kettlebells, plus pull ups and deadlifts/squats. He also does about 30 minute warm up, 20 minutes of HIIT and then 30 minute treadmill walk at 15 incline. He currently also has mobility and strengthening exercises for a back injury. 

He doesn’t enjoy rest days, and thinks of any time off as him losing progress… so say a week on holiday, he will come back and step on the scale and either complain about losing weight, or if he’s the same weight as before, about gaining fat. 

He doesn’t track calories and quite honestly doesn’t eat amazingly, he says he’s either too busy to make things and doesn’t eat enough, refuses to meal prep for convenience and also won’t take protein supplements because they’re not exactly nice. And then we’ll get doughnuts, and he’ll eat 3 in one sitting. Whereas I go out of my way to eat protein bars or mix protein into my Greek yoghurt as a snack, and will eat a couple bites of a sweet treat. 

He has been complaining a lot about getting „fat“, although in my opinion his composition hasn’t changed much at all. He weighs himself multiple times a da, with clothes on, then naked, then after a meal, then when he’s dehydrated and gets upset any time there’s significant change. And I don’t know how to combat this anymore. He wants to be „big“ and not lose weight, but also wants to lose fat. I’ve explained so many times that growth and fat loss are pretty much opposite Actions. He also wants to be aesthetic but doesn’t train for this at all.

My trainer has added them to my routine. I've watched videos on how to do it but I find them really hard. When I set the pins to parallel I can't get under the bar and I have no idea why. My body just won't 'fit'? I can squat to below parallel so I don't get it.

I set the pins higher than parallel but as soon as I put any weight on the bar the 'squat' instantly transforms into the top half of a good morning. It's frustrating! I just can't get my body to do what I want it to do and what I know it can do (with regular squats)

Long story short, life came at me fast in 2025. My training has been intermittent and I've not trained back-squat since December. Holy gee-fuck are the DOMS way more severe than I've ever experienced before. 

I'm trying to work out - as much for my own interest as anything else - why DOMS feel so much more severe now compared to previous times I've taken long breaks from a lift. Basically: Is there something I could've done to cause/avoid more severe DOMS than usual. 

I'm aware that DOMS: varies from person to person; will probably be worse if nutrition is worse; will be worse if the session was more intense; will be worse if you're sedentary in the days following... but as far as I can tell all of these things are roughly the same as they were last time I took a long break from squatting (hip injury)... But DOMs feels so much more severe... Any other factors I'm not thinking of? (Obviously not leaving a ~3 month gap in my training would have made the DOMS a lot less severe lol )

For context: for the first session back I gradually eased up to very sub-maximal weights (2pl for 4 sets of 5-6). Lifts felt very easy, bar a little stiffness as i started warming up, it felt to me in the moment like I took it very slow and didn't push myself too hard. Bar moved fine. 

Context if it's relevant: M/34/5'2''/73kg; forever intermediate; 2024 5rms OHP/DL/SQ: 80/150/145kg ; program in 2024 was modified 448 run 3-4x/week. Some hip issues meant this is not the first time I've re-started squat, but never felt doms like this.",1,2025-03-27 13:58:59,whatThisOldThrowAway

fitness,1jtfbm7,mltz39l,"Stupid question alert (I guess here is the place for it)...!

Currently doing starting Keto and doing light exercise with the intention of weight loss and general health/fitness. Not fussed about getting ripped or anything or hyper athleticism.

Using a Garmin watch to track activity, and Chronometer to track food.

Baseline maintenance calories on Garmin and checked with other sources comes out as ballpark 2200 kcal, daily activity comes out at around 1700-2500 kcal (walking couple of KM to work n back, exercise bike), giving a TDEE of around 3900-4700 kcal.

Using various Keto calculators for my size/weight it's putting my macros at around;

140g protein

30g carbs

105g fat

However when I input these into Chronometer it gives me a 1600 kcal total energy target, and then says 'totals don't match' against a 2200 kcal energy target (i.e. around my baseline, with my exercise being the deficit for weight loss).

Should be some scope for some calories there that aren't macros (? is that a thing beyond like, alcohol and the like?) and that it's suggesting a daily deficit of around 2000 kcal - which seems very extremely - possibly dangerously so?

Previously when on MFP a few years ago when I managed to lose an equivalent amount of weight (before having a kid and putting it all back on...) it wasn't like this, and would let me set (I assume broadly similar) macros like the above and a daily target of ballpark 2200.

My question is;

\- Am I doing something wrong in my macro calcs/setting up Cronometer/inputting them wrong.

\- Am I using calculators for fit people when I'm a fat fuck?

\- Is Cronometer fundamentally doing something different to MFP?

\- Is my watch way overestimating my exercise levels? Am I over exercising? Under eating/setting wrong goals?

Something isn't quite adding up somewhere and I'm not sure what...",3,2025-04-07 08:22:22,MassiveManTitties

I thought that I’d be able to handle an aggressive cut at the end of the cut, but it seems I am just mentally burnt out.

Im doing 30 minutes of cardio after every lifting day, keeping my heartrate above 130 BPM, doing incline walking on the treadmill.  I average about 11K steps a day.  Saturday is my active rest day, I do yoga.  Sunday is full rest day, then repeat my week.

My goal here is to retain as much muscle as possible, while loosing at much body fat as I can.  Ive seen some slight strength decrease so far on my lifts (bench went from 195 to 185).  I plan to cut until May 1st, so its a 2 month cut in total.  My only questions would be is a deficit of 700 too aggressive? and is doing my 30 mins of cardio 5 days a week too much?  I feel fantastic, workouts feel good, I have ample energy and my diet is really clean.  Drinking tons of water.

Thanks for reading!",3,2025-04-01 14:54:49,SpiralBlind

fitness,1jxd34q,mn04f2j,"Hi! I have a question I hope someone can help me with. I currently work from 8 AM to 6 PM, and after that, I go to the gym. Before working out, I usually eat a small portion of Greek yogurt with some granola. The thing is, I get home pretty late (around 8:30–9:00 PM), and I’ve heard that metabolism slows down at night.
Since I’m trying to lose weight, I usually eat dinner focused on protein. My question is: Should I still eat dinner after working out, or would it be better to have it before the workout? I'm concerned that eating too late might lead to storing fat instead of using the nutrients to recover muscle.

Note: I currently am on a calorie deficit diet, so I'm not sure if my body will be active enough to process the whole dinner instead of saving it as fat",2,2025-04-14 03:03:38,ExRije

I did a lower 1 day and noticed that after lunges my legs are destroyed, but with the leg press I got a nice glute stimulus perhaps because my quads were tired? This will be even more exaggerated in lower 2 day with 3 exercises.  
Is this too much volume for quad based exercises? Can this be bad for knees? I am training for about 6 months with 2 lunges and extensions only and recently tried some hack squats but I haven't seen much improvement in them and was thinking maybe the leg volume was low, that's why I am thinking to change up.",1,2025-04-12 10:04:53,njellinas

7,6,4,
8,8,6
8,8,8
9,7,6
10,6,5
10,8,7

Relatively new to fitness. I’ve been going to the gym 5 days per week for about 6 months. I’m about to start a cut and pick up cardio where I haven’t really been doing any so far. 

For time reasons, I’m leaning towards running in the morning and going to the gym for lifting in the evenings after work (which I do already). Is there any reason this isn’t as good as running right after you lift? Would it be better to lift in the evenings and then run on the treadmill right afterwards? If it’s no difference then I’ll stick to my plan but I don’t want to do myself a disservice if it will hurt my muscle gains or fat burning at all.

* Pushups (pausing at the bottom of rep) + dips + triceps bench dips + stretched lunges, a bit of ab wheel (just started that, can't go into a full ROM, knees on the ground)
* Pull ups (3x5-6), after an increase in the volume I could do, my form has improved to be pretty clean (full dead-hang and chin above bar), but I've been plateauing for a while: can't get more volume, can't get chest-to-bar. My PR is barely 10rep, butchering the end a bit

**Day-2 Gym - Back workout :**

* Lat pull downs (43kg)  |  Shoulder press (41kg)  | One-arm rowing (16kg)  |  Rear delt fly (39kg)  | seated rows (39kg)  |  Roman chair back extension (with 10kg)

**Day-3 - Climbing gym**

I will spend about 1h30 there, climbing around a 6A level

**Day-4 Gym - Legs and whatever I feel like doing :**

* Squats (80kg)  |  Hip abduction (39kg)  | Calves raises (18kg)  |  Leg press (90kg) or Prone leg curl (30kg)  |  Bulgarian squats (the nightmare... 14kg)
* I then add 2-3 exercises of what I feel like doing on that day, usually a mix of pecs and biceps/triceps
   * Dumbell press (16kg)   |   Pec fly (love the stretch, 52kg)  | Triceps pull (18kg) or machine (54kg)  | Hammer curl (9kg)

But halfway up the climb it appears I ""acclimated"" and got used to it. I still took breaks but as opposed to the beginning of the climb I was not panting as hard.

What happened? Did my body ""wake up"" or something?

Started with the bar on all lifts except deadlift, I think I started at 85 on DL

My current lifts are  
Bench: 115  
Bent over row: 100  
DL: 165  
Squat: 120 (had some knee pain last few weeks so i've just been practicing my form on squats)  
OHP: 70 (super slow progression here due to form issues)

These are all 3x5+

Is this bad progression? Last two weeks I've been stalling on the lifts but I reckon it's because of some stress at work messing with my sleep and diet. 

The wiki recommends switching to a different program after 3 months so I thought about doing 531 next. Should I do that or maybe stick with this one for few more weeks.",1,2025-04-22 09:59:59,cow_clowns

fitness,1jwld90,mmt6bxz,"Hello everyone, I've recently started going to the gym and I need help setting some kind of a casual routine (Going 3 times a week). My goal is to improve my overall health and not feel constantly tired and sleepy. I spend a lot of time sitting at work and then just sleeping at home, skipping meals a lot of time because I just don't have any appetite or am tired to cook or even just eat precooked meals.  

What I do so far -> threadmill since it was the easiest equipment to use at first, some exercises on a mat (which I take from youtube videos), back extension, lat pulldown, hip adductor/abductor machine, squats with dumbbells, elliptic trainer. (I know I'm all over the place, hence the need for the routine). 

Results so far -> 
1: I like doing cardio a lot, allows me to just de-stress after work without the need to count or think about things (reps, which exercise after which, sets). 
2: I feel like I'm gaining appetite and drinking more water. 

Fear -> I don't want to lose fat or weight as I'm already skinny and weak as it is, I don't mind gaining muscle. (26F, 47kg on a bloated day).

I eat quite a bit, especially at night, but ive never really gotten „fat“, just a bit bulkier.

SQ: 40x5 > 140x5  
DL: 100x5 > 155x5 (always sucked at it)

My current stamina isn't the best, and I'd say I'm below average or just around average as of now. So a question arose on my mind, what is more effective/better? Running 20 minutes over an interval of 1x20 minutes (meaning running 20 minutes non-stop) or 2x10 minutes, (running 10 minutes twice with a break of 5-10 minutes in between) Or even, 15-5 or 5-15. Is there a difference between each of these routines? I personally find it hard to run 20 minutes non stop and get very exhausted, but I can run 10-10 fairly well, and the 10 minute break really helps me. Just for reference, I'm a Male in my 20's, and I run on 8km/h.

Also just a small question, how important is stretching before running? I've been stretching for around 5 minutes before each workout. Is it very helpful, or just negligible?

Today was day 3 of week 2, so squat & bench + accessories day. My barbell bench press AMRAP was 5 x 80kg(176lbs). My squat AMRAP was 6 x 85kg (187lbs). (For completeness my deadlift AMRAP is 6 x 122kg(268lbs) & my OHP AMRAP is 6 x 45kg (99lbs)).


Any idea why my squat is so weak compared to my other lifts? What additional exercises can I do to help strengthen it?


When I'm doing the squat AMRAP set I know my legs have more in them, but after rep 6 today I started seeing black spots and my body felt incredibly fatigued - but i think i had a few more reps in my legs... once I racked the bat and took a few breaths i felt fine again like i could go and do another 4 or 5 (but followed the program dropping the weight down and doing the 5x5).

When cutting, I have been doing 1500 calories a day.
Maintenance for me has been around 2000 calories. I took a month off for maintenance and intend to start back up next week in hopes of reducing body fat. 
Exercise Routine: Mon - upper, Tues- lower, wed - upper, Thurs - Peloton, Fri - lower, Saturday - Peloton, Sun - Rest
I also try to hit 8-10k steps a day. But on most days I end up doing an incline walk or a weighted vest walk so it’s a bit more intense.
Peloton days are intense, HIIT style 

Any tips or recommendations to lose the last 5%? Am I doing too much cardio? Should I not be doing an incline walk but instead just flat steps (less intense)?",1,2025-04-19 13:49:56,technoguy06

I bought a rack so I could start benching, and I am not going too heavy at the start as I am trying to work my way up due to bad shoulders. But I've been doing dumbell pressing for a year now and never once got sore in my lats. Also, I've never once been able to get DOMS in my lats by doing strict back exercises (rows and pulldowns of all types of angles and variations, pullups, and pullover variations).

fitness,1jzn7g9,mn9wy6w,"Hi, I have a problem with pull-ups — I can’t seem to do more of them, and it feels like nothing is changing. I’ve been going to the gym for over 3 years now. I started with 3 pull-ups, gradually got stronger, and eventually could do 7–10 in the first set, then fewer in the next sets. But once I hit that rep range, everything just stalled.  Some days I can only do 6 max, sometimes I hit 10, then the next week I might only manage 5 again. I always train to failure in every set. I’ve tried all sorts of methods — adding weights, doing more sets — literally everything, but my numbers don’t go up. Once I hit a max of 11 reps, that’s where it’s stayed for the past year or two.  I go to the gym 3–6 times a week (the frequency has changed over time). All my other lifts have been progressing well — I’ve gotten stronger across the board. What’s strange is that my back actually looks really good — probably the best-looking part of my physique — but my pull-up strength just won’t improve.  Has anyone dealt with something similar and can help out? I’m really fed up. Pull-ups are super hard for me, but I keep doing them because I really want to break through.",2,2025-04-15 18:21:19,Savings-Connection73

The routine: (A few years ago, I joined a program at the gym that was more strength training based vs hypertrophy I'd say). We'd do first 15 minutes of a couple exercises like box jumps and kettlebell swings. And then the next 45 minutes would be lifting (full body), like 2 leg exercises (we'd rotate between squat variation, deadlift, RDL's), 1-2 exercises for back (pull-ups and single arm dumbbell rows, maybe something with a cable sometimes), bench press for chest, and single arm dumbbell press for shoulders. The rep scheme would typically be around 3x8. My plan is to do this 3x a week. 

When I first started this, I only did this twice a week and I lost 20 pounds in 10 months with no changes in diet and I maintained that for 8-9 months easy. Then after that, I moved and didn't know what to do and I gained weight. I'm 6 pounds heavier now and thinking of following that routine with the same exercises (cuz I loved them and need a routine that incorporates these, especially bulgarian split squats!).

Rest day

Cardio is one of following: 4x4 intervalls, 2x2 intervalls, 30 min slow jog

I do supersets of two and two exercises, followed by a back exercise and stretch.
Minimum 2 minutes between supersets.

Back exercises and stretches focus on lower back/anterior pelvic tilt.  
Exercises: 90 degree wall sit, plank, glute bridge, glute bridge one leg, cow cat, 
quadruped leg raise, prone press ups, kneeling hip flexor stretch, ""superman w pull"", other minor stretches

Fitness goal is staying reasonably fit at a healthy weight and pain free. Had issues with back pain, but gotten better after implementing exercises fixing anterior pelvic tilt.
Worked out consistently for last couple of years. Current program around 4 months.

Anything I could add/remove, or move to different days to complement each other?  I try to do ABCD, so one rest day per week. But if work is busy, I try to at least do the bigger compound lifts and back exercises.

I have a home gym. Equipment is threadmill, stationary bike, barbells, dumbbells, kettlebells, resistance bands, simple rack and bench.",1,2025-04-05 09:18:57,snilsberg

I have been using MacroFactor and successfully be losing weight, I would assume I am around 20% body fat currently. My goal is to lose my stubborn love handles. I decided to do some online coaching that involves a diet plan, and the plan they’ve given me consists of pretty much identical meals every day, only Whole Foods with protein pan fried with a bit of oil etc. it’s day 3, and I feel horrible eating the same things every day. Plus, it’s extremely inconvenient with my working pattern, having to eat a proper lunch. 

My question is, do you have to go to such extreme(in my opinion) lengths for a goal like this? I have been consistently losing weight following macro factor with less torturing eating habits than to begin with.",2,2025-04-13 09:56:20,capt_avocado

fitness,1jr7fa6,mldg9au,"Question: For someone who has exercised regularly for many years (both weights and cardio in a wide variety/frequency/intensity), is lifting weights more effective for weight loss than cardio? (assuming calorie deficit)

I ask because I’ve heard people say that cardio burns calories while doing it, whereas strength training builds muscle which improves your metabolism which helps you burn more calories throughout the day. I would assume that for someone new to fitness, more focus on weight lifting would definitely be a great way to kick off weight loss. 

However I’m thinking that since I already have a solid foundation, any gains to metabolism would probably be small and therefore more focus on cardio is probably the better way to go? I also am not looking to gain any more muscle and would even be fine losing some during this time",1,2025-04-04 13:45:38,sassytexas

I typically do all chest first then all back exercises and then alternate on the next upper day because I find I can hit a lower RPE faster with less weight this way.

I’m 37M, 5’11” 275 lbs. I’ve been running stating strength since Jan and my lifts are now: 190 squat, 185 bench, 260 dead, 110 OHP. Still increasing but much more slowly.

I eat roughly 190 g of protein a day and around 2,300-2,400 kcals. Am slowly and steadily losing weight. Also 16 days sober from booze — was an extremely heavy daily drinker — so I suppose that’s a MAJOR datapoint lol. I also don’t sleep enough but am trying.

Anyway, trying to figure out what to do now. I was swimming or spinning on my non-lifting days but now my body feels a little too tired to do those things and prefers just getting in 15,000 steps walking.

Should I stay the course? Should I try forcing the cardio? Etc? My goals, which are kind of at ends with each other, are weight loss and strength gain.
