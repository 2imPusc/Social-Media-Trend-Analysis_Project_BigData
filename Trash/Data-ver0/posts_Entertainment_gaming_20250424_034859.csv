gaming,1jvh26x,My 75 year old father has almost finished Red Dead Redemption 1: Still can't believe it,"**A quick recap of how this came to be:** My brother and I separately finished both Red Dead Redemption games. (I finished the second one as recently as last year, and belong to the perhaps 10% of people that believe the 1st is the best. But that both belong together as being, in unison, one of the top 10 of all time, certainly of my lifetime. The first one alone is 'perfect' which I find so rare a label to give a game personally)

My father, as you may guess from his age, grew up when the wild west, westerns were all the rage. He took us to Arizona, to Tucson, to Tombstone, to see heartland of Wyatt Earp, Doc Holiday, Wildbill Hickock and recounted all the stories he knew about them. Long before many people had heard 'Big Iron' through New Vegas, he had it playing in the car on that trip as part of a CD playlist.

Flash forward to last year: I bought the game when it came out on PC (finally), my brother got him his first controller, (I stopped him from attempting to play with keyboard and mouse).

Off he went. As of today, it seems this was the right decision. I knew when I first played it that this was the game for him, and now it's proven 100%.

Not a given: Although I did get him to previously play the Mass Effect Trilogy, which he loved, I was not successful with some others: XCOM, Imperator, Mafia 2, Crusader Kings 2, DA: Origins, all unsuccessfully. They never stuck. He tried them, then just gave up and did something else.

This one however, I wanted to make damn sure he tried, even if he had to struggle with the controller. Set up whatsapp and Steam Broadcast to help when necessary.

Next thing I knew he started doing the next mission, then bounty missions... I saw him in a few combat encounters which he got through....

I had to prod him to use dead eye more often, and use the movement and camera sticks in unison for more fluid play, but it hardly matters. He got on fine and went from mission to mission with great interest (a lot of this stuff I think is obvious for those who grew up with GTA and other similar 3rd person action titles)

**His experience starting up:**

Some initial issues: I set auto-aim to normal which helped, he still had to explore getting used to the twin sticks, and the multitude of buttons. I had to explain to him via a videocall where the triggers where and how they work with aiming and firing.  Biggest issues he had was understanding how cover-based shooting works, initially he'd constantly use the crouch button which was wrong.

But eventually, I could just see him play on his own... past New Austin, past Mexico .... and now he's past the final gang member (>!Dutch!<) nearing the end of the game (though of course he has no idea).

**Some questions on what he thought:**

\-I checked whether he was following the story, and he definitely could recount all the names, the Van der Linde gang, Javier Escuela and Bill Williamson, Bonnie, Seth... everything.

\-Got more or less the impressions I got of the characters.

\-I think he was impressed as anyone else about the Mexico part of the game.

\-He asked what the undead nightmare mode is: I told him to play it once the main game is over. I still have no clue how to explain to him what it is. 'How will I know when the main story is finished' 'You'll know'.

\-Spoiler (leave uncovered if you have not played RDR1) I think that >!once the main story concludes and the shock comes, I'll tell him that the last part could have gone differently if he had used dead eye properly!<... or not

\-At this point I think it's all but certain that he loves the game, more than I could have hoped for, but I knew he would. Now sort of wondering, if, as I expect, he wants to play RDR2, how to best do that. His computer was good enough for RDR1, but the sequel is a whole different ballgame.

Best of all, I've refused to tell him anything about RDR2, except that most people disagree with me and think it's not only better than the first, but among the greatest of all time.

Whatever happens, I am happy I got him to play this. It was an intention I had for years and knew immediately when the PC version dropped.

I think however, apart from the personal story I've shared above, it definitely is a case in point that it really isn't ever too late to learn how to play a relatively modern game even with a controller one has never used. There is a certain amount of logic and intuition that can include most people with little prior experience.",1200,0.92,155,2025-04-09 21:17:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1jvh26x/my_75_year_old_father_has_almost_finished_red/,SlightWerewolf4428

gaming,1jngqz9,What games have you played that had overly aggressive rubber banding or anti-winning mechanics?,"Do you have any personal examples of games that actively prevented you from winning too hard, and you felt that it negatively impacted the overall experience? Racing games and kart racers are notorious for doing this, but I've heard that Oblivion had enemies very obviously leveling up as you progressed through the game (edit: I've read the comments, this wasn't an issue apparently), and Fifa games had boosted odds of scoring when someone was losing.

For me, Mario Kart SC's 2nd place CPU had an extreme speed boost when you got too far ahead, and this was very obvious because the game had powerful shortcuts that allowed you to gain a lot of distance quickly, and right after you did that, the 2nd place CPU instantly doubled their speed and you saw him zooming in the minimap.

I don't think that these kinds of mechanics are objectively bad, but they can become problematic if they are used too obviously and excessively.",1142,0.93,466,2025-03-30 16:51:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1jngqz9/what_games_have_you_played_that_had_overly/,MixaLv

gaming,1jqgf7e,All these price hikes are not ever going to reach the developers. Development is already being actively outsourced to lower cost regions and 3rd party outfits.,"I just thought it was worth reminding everyone of this. I know there is a lot of discussion right now about GTA6, the Nintendo Switch 2, the prices of skins in games like League of Legends, etc. There's a whole lot of discussion about how these prices are absurd, are going to alienate the playerbase, etc.

Something that really isn't being given proper attention is that **the justification for why these price hikes need to happen are directly in contrast to the reality of the gaming industry**.

Just in the past week, I've seen memes pointing out how ""*games haven't kept their pricing in line with inflation""*, while failing to account that many games now include a base price, microtransactions, season passes, DLC packs, etc. We recently had the head of *Saber Interactive* go on the record, bragging about how their strategy is to ""*cut costs*"" and outsource development to emergent regions as a means of bolstering profits. You can read more about it here:( [https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-reboot-developer-didnt-know-what-they-were-building-saber-ceo-says-criticising-shuttered-team](https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-reboot-developer-didnt-know-what-they-were-building-saber-ceo-says-criticising-shuttered-team) )We've certainly heard the trope of Phillipe Tremblay of Ubisoft and the whole ""*Gamers need to get used to not owning games.*"" and whatnot. And even though he is no longer there, I think everyone recalls when John Riccitiello of Unity had once suggested charging gamers for the ability to reload their weapons. We're now even hearing about how ""*GTA6 is going to kill a lot of studios and publishers""* making the rounds

What seems to be slipping under the radar is that, despite posting record profits, developers have been getting laid off for nearly 2 years now. It was attributed to the ""*COVID hangover*"" at first, then it came down to ""*inflated development costs*"", now we're circling back to ""*games haven't kept up with inflation""*, and I expect (undoubtedly) that we'll soon see the newly-minted tariffs as a reason why the business needs to raise prices. There doesn't seem to be **any** discussion about the job losses that *already* took place. There doesn't seem to be any discussion about how the very same companies crying foul about development costs ***have already moved their operations overseas*** as a means of cutting costs.

These price hikes have nothing to do with the business being unsustainable, and everything to do with corporate greed. Companies don't get to outsource their operations to Poland, Brasil, China, Vietnam, Turkey, the Phillipines, and outsource providers **and also** complain that they aren't making enough money. These same companies are actively trying to cut headcounts and incorporate tools that replace even more humans, such as Activision starting to include generative AI to build assets, or using deceptive contract language to replace voice actors with AI generated lines. Whole divisions of game development have been outsourced to 3rd party providers, who pocket anywhere between 20-60% of the contract's value while underpaying contractors who don't have any benefits or protections; companies like *Keywords* and *Pole to Win* now, almost assuredly, do the majority of testing for your games. They charge the biggest players in the field full price salaries, while subcontracting the work to people for $10/hr. When developers tried to unionize, they were already being let go. Unionization efforts are effectively failing across the industry.

If these proposed price hikes went to ensuring development teams were being maintained, staying together, promoting longevity and sequels and the opportunity to create more new titles, I think gamers would consider it more tolerable; but that isn't happening. Studios are cutting costs, firing staff, and paying out even bigger bonuses to a handful of C-suite members. **C-Suite staff do not make video games**. People like Matt Karch, a person wealthy enough to own a private jet, are doing press tours telling everyone how expensive game development is while his company pays people a fraction of what they would have earned 5 years ago. These price hikes aren't going to ensure that developers and studios can build new titles freely; they're going to ensure that the financial class which has actively been ruining this industry for a decade gets to reap even bigger rewards off the backs of consumers. All while they whimper and whine about how difficult, how expensive, how unsustainable game development has become.

EDIT:I thought I would add this, after commenting it in response to another user's reply.

Keep in mind that many developers **are already:**

* using a pre-existing Engine to expedite game development
* using AI to generate assets (art, audio, V/O, missions/narrative design)
* using outsourced shops to control quality and handle player support issues
* using volunteers to moderate social media/manage communities
* using content creators for marketing/pushing product sales
* in a specific instance, using players to create free content for the game, as noted in the case of *Minecraft, Roblox, and Fortnite Creative/UEFN* where modders work for free and the parent company takes a share of any profits generated",1061,0.9,223,2025-04-03 11:54:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1jqgf7e/all_these_price_hikes_are_not_ever_going_to_reach/,CyberSmith31337

Shaders are Iteration for those who are curious. I also use RTX as well, some of the additional packs I have on this world I have been developing for quite some time. Most of these shots are done after the landscape are rendered. Because actually playing in them is quite demanding on the PC rn.

The second time I won, I got this plaque, some stickers, and other swag that I don't longer have, along with one year of free rentals at Blockbuster, which is only 12 rentals a year because you only get one a month. 

Anyway, I was never called back or flown to Florida (?) to participate in the competition for all the store winners, which sucks because that would have been a cool experience and story to have to share with people.

Warhammer Total War III: Deep strategy game with a huge range of available factions and units, great design, but the real-time battles just felt too chaotic for me and like I didn't have enough control over my units - being ultimately unsatisfying.

gaming,1jzsyhe,What games would you recommend for a grandpa who can't move for 8 months?,"My 72 year old father hurt his foot and he's in for a long recovery, about 8 months. He lives with my mother and while I try to get over there as much as I can to bring some positivity, it's usually only once or twice a week and means long stretches of time where he can't escape the most negative, patronizing person I've ever met (I love and respect my mother, but you gotta call a spade a spade). I have an Xbox Series X that I hardly use because I mostly PC game (and the kids are too young for it) so I wanted to set it up for him to hopefully give him that escape and let him interact with the outside world and engage the problem solving portion of his brain so he's not just withering away. 

What I'm looking for is a good game or couple games that will be good for someone who  
1) hasn't played a video game since the Pac-Man arcade box  
2) can occasionally get easily frustrated  
3) would really benefit from a positive online community

I have Xbox Game Pass so that whole library is available, but I have no problem buying something that fits the bill for what I'm looking for.

gaming,1jlugs6,I wish the open world in AC games felt less like an open air museum,"So after having played Shadows for a week now, I have to say that my initial excitement has died down a fair bit and I already start feeling a bit burned out. As with Origins and Odyssey, they once again crafted an absolutely stunning open world with a ton of detail. But just as with these games, it feels more like am walking around a theme park without actually interacting with it. 
The function to get some historical context every now and then is great in theory but doesn't help the feeling like I am in a museum. When discovering a new town, I can talk to maybe 3 people and one or two merchants. Oh, and pet dogs. 

A big issue for me is also how very little unique some important places work as part of the level design. Osaka castle should historically speaking be a super important landmark in the game. Yet I can just walk in there within the first couple of hours and kill everyone without having to worry too much about the layout of the castle etc. And the process of infiltrating castles stays the exact same for every single one of them. Except for nice vistas, the rewards for exploration are also quite negligible since equipment gets outscaled so quickly.

I just wish they would include at least a little bit more immersion. I don't expect KC2, but just some elements to make the world feel alive. At least that would help me not feeling burned out by the game after such a short while.",671,0.79,317,2025-03-28 12:58:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1jlugs6/i_wish_the_open_world_in_ac_games_felt_less_like/,SapporoBiru

The site (dev.gameinformer.com) is completely broken at the moment, but what excellent news. I felt like there was a giant hole in the gaming industry since they went down. From the looks of it, the original staff is back, they have all of their archive, and they have a ton of articles that were done during the hiatus. 

I always loved GI, even after I began shilling them for 12 years, and I'm pumped to see what they can do without some shitty corporation hamstringing them.

Edit: here's the official link to their YouTube channel with their ""We're Back"" video.

TL:DR - they talk about who's back (everyone), how they came back (Gunzilla Games bought them, they spun off into Game Informer Inc., and will operate independently and without interference), backdated content is on the site now (GotY 2024), as well as content/reviews from the last couple of months, magazine subscriptions will be coming back (more info later), stay tuned, and they're happy they're back.

gaming,1jkel49,The first time I ever cried because of a video game was last night — and I’m not even embarrassed about it.,"I grew up playing games for fun, for challenge, for competition. I’ve broken controllers in rage, laughed with friends on voice chat, and stayed up way too late grinding levels. But I never really *felt* anything deeper than that… until last night.

I finished *Spiritfarer*. I won’t spoil anything, but there’s this moment — if you’ve played it, you know the one — where the game doesn’t just *end*, it *lets go* of you. And something about how it handled loss, love, and closure completely hit me in a way no game ever has.

I sat there staring at the credits and just cried. Not like sobbing, but the kind of quiet tears you get when something reaches way further into your chest than you expected. It was beautiful.

Gaming used to be just an escape for me. But last night it reminded me that games can also be a place to *process*. A space where you sit with things. And I’m kind of grateful for that.

Has a game ever hit you like that emotionally? Curious if I’m just late to the party or if others have had similar experiences.",492,0.8,473,2025-03-26 15:33:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1jkel49/the_first_time_i_ever_cried_because_of_a_video/,itswickedbby

gaming,1jo93iv,Hot Take: I personally love knowledge checks in videos games,"I’ve noticed that between a lot of gaming community and friends that knowledge checks are something that most people do not enjoy. 

However, I personally have always loved knowledge checks in a lot of video games I’ve played, such as many Soulborne games, LoL, various fighting games. Pokemon, heck.. even Clash Royale.

To me, there is just something so fun about experiencing a crazy interaction and learning about it for future matches or playthrough. I understand that a lot of people don’t like mechanics that are not mentioned explicitly and consider it unfair, but I do personally find it skillful to be able to lose to a specific interaction or knowledge check and to be able to learn and be aware of it for future gameplay. 

I am not saying that games be riddled with knowledge checks, but I do think there is a bit of magic and depth added to a game when there are just niche interactions and mechanics that aren’t explained to you and something you have to learn on your own.",353,0.71,163,2025-03-31 17:39:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1jo93iv/hot_take_i_personally_love_knowledge_checks_in/,0verlimit
gaming,1jyq76v,All I want is a modern Star Trek or Star Wars MMORPG that isn't stuck in 2012. Is that too much to ask?,"I've been rewatching Star Trek: Picard after binging Lower Decks and Strange New Worlds, and revisiting bits of TNG, DS9, Voyager, you name it. Like a lot of fans, I ended up back in Star Trek Online (yes, I even bought the lifetime subscription way back when), and while it scratches a nostalgic itch, it's honestly so outdated and overwhelming now. It feels like trying to patch a Holodeck program on Windows XP.

And here's the thing. How has no one truly capitalized on this universe?

Star Trek has infinite content potential. Exploration, diplomacy, ethics, politics, war, weird science, personal growth, interspecies dynamics. Yet in gaming, we mostly get clunky MMOs and mobile cash grabs.

The same goes for Star Wars: The Old Republic. Massive lore, beloved characters, a hungry fanbase. And still no truly groundbreaking modern MMORPG or single-player RPG?

Imagine a Star Trek MMORPG that starts you at Starfleet Academy. You choose your path. Command, Science, Engineering. The game evolves with you. You make moral decisions, negotiate with Klingons, explore anomalies that defy the laws of physics, or dive deep into espionage with the Romulan Free State. It could be built on a sleek modern engine, with real world-building and character depth. 

Give us Mass Effect in the Federation, and I would never touch grass again.

So why has no one built this? Is it licensing? Fear of the scale? Or do they just not understand how many of us would throw money at our screens for something this immersive?

Anyone else out there feel the same? Or already dreaming up the perfect Star Trek or Star Wars MMORPG?

gaming,1jphpku,Atomfall feels like a half baked game.,"I've enjoyed my time playing Atomfall, but it never pulled me in like say, Fallout does. There's a lot of reasons why I think this is, some are personal to me I'm sure, but some I think are more general critiques of the game.

First, I find the lack of fast travel a huge negative. I know none of the maps are that large. But having to take the same route from Interchange to Wyndham, past the same 6 Outlaws for fifth time isn't fun. It doesn't help that killing them is just a waste of ammo since an encounter with them always net negative. This feels intentional to discourage combat, but when my options are combat and get to where I'm going or spend three to five minutes avoiding combat every time, it's not longer fun avoiding combat all the game.

On the subject of combat... Stealth absolutely sucks. It's so hit and miss I don't really bother with it. The number of times there's no indicator someone can see me but they're already aggressive is too much. I always favor stealth in games, but in Atomfall I've completely given up on using it. Even when you do get a stealth takedown. It seems to broadcast a signal five rooms over to let all the other enemies know you're there. (I know a skill reduces this noise, but still.)

Finally, let's talk about melee. It sucks. It's just a spammy, terrible system. There's no blocking, so I guess you're supposed to use your kick to make distance, but then you have to close distance to do damage. All in all, it feels like using the crowbar in Half Life. Spam hits and hope it works. This becomes even worse when you're fighting the infected who are boring to fight with melee but also sponge bullets like no tomorrow.

Probably my other biggest complaint is the fact basically everyone is aggressive everywhere. Outside of Wyndham, anywhere you go is enemies only. Plot is given for some of this, but most of it just feels like an excuse to keep you on your toes or to make you take exaggerated and long routes to get anywhere. This isn't helped by the fact you slide off any slightly angled surface which really feels like it punishes exploration.

All in all, a 6 out 10 game for me. It feels like a game that needs another 30% added to it to really feel like a full game. Many reviewers point out that it feels like an old game, and perhaps that's true. But there's many older games that are more engaging and more fun. Heck, compare it to Fallout 3 even. I think there's a lot of potential in Atomfall. But it doesn't feel realized.

gaming,1jw1anr,What’s your weapon of choice when playing a game?,"FUCKING DAGGERS, idc if it’s a shitty tool, idc if it’s absolutely broken I will always go the way of stealth and daggers are usually the way for it. I played the first half of Elden Ring just going behind people for a 50% health check or kill and that was with a dagger once I was able to get it. 

Dual wielding is another, doesn’t matter if it’s a sword or a damn pistol I am always going to pick up two of the same weapon type to get that sweet satisfying kill with two instead of one. 

Also, I don’t care if it makes the game easier or I lose an attachment slot for it. The silencer is my go to for anything. Sniper and handcanons are a close second, it’s the damn thrill of it. You telling me when you’re shooting a pistol like 007 you aren’t a fucking gangster? Absolutely hands down more fun but less viable depending on how you use it / if the game rewards it.

I had played Final Fantasy games before, so I knew I liked the series. When my mom took me for our weekly Friday Blockbuster outing, I saw Tactics for the first time and picked it up. I had never played a game like it and I was enamored. I barely made a dent in the story by the time I had to return it, so I asked my mom if we could buy it. We couldn’t find it anywhere. So for something like 2 months, every Friday I’d return FFT and immediately re-rent it, before we finally found a copy. It’s my favorite game of all time and I’ve beaten it several times since then. 

Was there a game you re-rented over and over?

Tell me about the games you know were total dog shit, everyone rated poorly, including YOU but for some reason, you still somehow, someway enjoyed them.

I'll confess first.

My gaming sin is Redfall.

That game is buggy, framerate drops galore and normally I don't give a shit so if I give a shit, its REAL REAL bad. The AI for that game is more A than I and crashes. Oh god the Crashes.

But man... playing as a cryptid hunter as Devinder and using the Stake launcher, killing things, just hit all the right buttons in my brain.

Heavy weapons go brrrrr.

I still wrote a scathing review about that game on the Steam page. I stated that I liked playing the game but I couldn't in good conscience EVER recommend the game to another person because of above issues. I believe I rated it 4-5/10. ASS. 

I actually got a Bethesda support staff to respond asking if there was anything they could do to fix it and I told em, its not your problem to solve, its managements and there's no way in hell they can salvage this game. And I was right.
