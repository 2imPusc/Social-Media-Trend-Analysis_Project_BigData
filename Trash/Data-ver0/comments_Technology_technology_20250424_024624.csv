technology,1jo69dm,mkpe6jf,"I've been dealing with a similar flood of bot traffic causing resource consumption issues on a shared hosting server I manage. My sites are all staticly cached and therefore load up instant, since they are also fronted by Cloudflare. However, in the last few months I have seen a massive uptick in obvious bot traffic. A lot of it lacks user agent strings, and is originating from Microsoft Azure. It doesn't check the robots.txt file, and much of it appears to be scanning for vulnerable scripts and files on the site. I have seen some OpenAI and Huawei crawlers visit, and they do check the robots.txt file.


The last week or so about 92% of my personal site requests has been blocked by Cloudflare due to WAF rules and bot Challenges from obvious BS hosted in data centers. Some of these requests came in batches of 80-120 requests a second and go on for minutes. If they weren't being stopped, and assuming they were all valid, dynamic pages, my web server would be really unhappy about that.



Years ago when I hosted the same site out of my home, I did it on 128Kbps of uplink (and it was fast), on a server with a Pentium 3 Processor, and with 128MB or less of RAM.


I'm planning to generate similar nonsense data for these bots in the form of a 404 page.

technology,1jo69dm,mkuekzx,"It's a very relevant concern, as AI is increasingly used to gather and manipulate information on social media. Here's a breakdown of how to protect yourself from AI-driven information-gathering attempts:
Understanding the Threat:
 * AI's Data-Gathering Capabilities:
   * AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of social media data to build detailed profiles of individuals.
   * This includes your interests, habits, relationships, and even your emotional state.
   * AI can also be used to create very convincing fake profiles, and messages.
 * AI-Powered Social Engineering:
   * AI can craft personalized messages and scams that are more likely to trick you.
   * Deepfakes and AI-generated content can be used to spread misinformation and manipulate your opinions.
Strategies for Protection:
 * Minimize Your Digital Footprint:
   * Be mindful of what you share on social media.
   * Limit the amount of personal information you post, such as your address, phone number, and date of birth.
   * Adjust your privacy settings to restrict who can see your posts.
 * Be Skeptical of Unsolicited Contact:
   * Be wary of messages from strangers or suspicious accounts.
   * Don't click on links or open attachments from unknown sources.
   * Verify the identity of anyone who asks you for personal information.
 * Recognize AI-Generated Content:
   * Be aware that AI can create realistic-looking fake profiles, images, and videos.
   * Look for inconsistencies or oddities in the content.
   * If something seems too good to be true, it probably is.
 * Use Strong Privacy Settings:
   * Take advantage of the privacy settings offered by social media platforms.
   * Limit the amount of information that is publicly available.
   * Regularly review and update your privacy settings.
 * Stay Informed:
   * Keep up to date on the latest AI-powered scams and social engineering tactics.
   * Educate yourself about how AI is being used to gather and manipulate information.
 * Be Cautious of Quizzes and Online ""Tests"":
   * Many of these are designed to gather specific information about you.
   * This information can then be used to create targeted adds, or to aid in social engineering.
Key Considerations:
 * The fight against AI-driven information gathering is ongoing.
 * Social media platforms are constantly evolving their security measures.
 * Your vigilance and awareness are your best defenses.
By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce your risk of falling victim to AI-powered information-gathering attempts on social media.",2,2025-04-01 12:18:55,trancepx

technology,1jw6hdk,mmixgc1,"For the doubters: this is a sort of middle ground, short-term solution. It somewhat protects domestic manufacturers while they get their act together, simultaneously allows Chinese vehicles in the market but at higher prices (that go to the manufacturer rather than as tax), it also has the effect of putting pressure on domestic manufacturers to innovate and compete.

It is a short-term solution where the idea is that, after a while, European manufacturers have caught up at least to sustainable levels, and the green transition has continued thanks to the influx of Chinese vehicles in the interim.

Can it backfire? Yes. But I think European manufacturers are very well aware of the threat and are working their asses of to try to get up to speed. The most threatened manufacturers are not Audi, Porsche, Volvo, BMW and Mercedes, but Fiat, VW, Skoda, Opel, Renault, Citroen and so on. People will continue to buy luxury vehicles, both because of the brand and quality, and because they are really not that far behind in EV tech. Porsche are doing well with their EV tech for instance. But the lower end is threatened. That is also why we see countries like Germany and Sweden voted against or abstained from voting on the tariffs, citing that competition is healthy and they are largely going to be okay. But countries like Italy and France voted for the tariffs, countries that mainly produce lower end vehicles and are much more threatened by Chinese EV’s at low prices.

Outright banning the sale of foreign EV’s through super high tariffs, like those in the US, has the opposite mindset. It only works as to protect the domestic manufacturers in the short-term. In the long-term, it leads to a lack of innovation since these companies do not need to compete. The result of this can be seen in for example the semi-truck industry in the US, that is severely behind the world and lacking competition.

>According to financial data company PitchBook, investors funnelled nearly $155bn globally into defence tech startups between 2021 and 2024, up from $58bn over the previous four years. The US has more than 1,000 venture capital-backed companies working on “smarter, faster and cheaper” defence, says Dale Swartz from consultancy McKinsey, adding that Europe has seen an uptick in defence tech startups too. While most of the funding has gone to US-based companies, some, such as German startup Helsing, have seen significant amounts. Yet a sector set on reinventing defence with Silicon Valley values also raises concerns, including whether it could bring us closer to war – and Donald Trump looms large.
>
>As the upstart defence industry sees it, the current system is not set up to meet the needs of the modern war fighter. We are entering a new era where machines go to war, albeit working with humans, and there is a huge need for autonomy and AI that the “defence primes” – the massive companies the defence department has traditionally partnered with to build ships, planes, tanks and strategic deterrence weaponry such as Lockheed Martin, RTX and Boeing – do not have the right muscles to deliver. As a result, the US risks losing its edge in its ability to respond, which is something the startups say they can help fix.
>
>And the potential rewards are enormous. The US spends about $850bn annually on its military, approximately half of which goes on procuring new items or maintaining old equipment, while the total military spending globally is more than $2.4tn – an amount set to rise significantly as Europe assumes an increased burden for its own security.
>
>Not, says the defence startup sector, that it is just about money. Imbuing it is a zeal to help the US and its allies retain a military advantage over their adversaries in an increasingly dangerous world. “The engineering elite of Silicon Valley has an affirmative obligation to participate in the defence of the nation,” states the preface of The Technological Republic, a new book by Alex Karp, which can be viewed as a manifesto for the fast-rising industry. Karp is the chief executive and co-founder, along with billionaire Peter Thiel, of AI-driven software company Palantir Technologies, which, with Elon Musk’s SpaceX, is seen as a trailblazer for the upstart industry.
>
>...
>
>Yet the lion’s share of the funding is still going to the primes, the startups complain. The industry is “emerging fast in the outside world, but not so fast in terms of budgetary reassignment”, notes Andy Lowery, chief executive of Epirus, another high-valuation startup that is focused on disabling swarms of many thousands of attack drones using high-energy microwave forcefields, and is working with the British military’s Army Futures directorate on how the technology may be useful to the UK.
>
>The problem – and what needs to be disrupted, many in the emerging sector argue – is the US defence department’s antiquated system of military acquisition and procurement, which has long budget planning cycles and is oriented towards buying large, expensive, static hardware systems that can take many years to come to fruition and leave little space for innovation because the contracts are so overly prescriptive.
>
>...
>
>Yet the push to remake defence has left some worried. Elke Schwarz, a professor of political theory at Queen Mary University of London, has analysed the effect of venture capital dynamics on military norms. It is not, she argues, that the defence sector may not benefit from an overhaul – a shift towards new technologies and greater agility. But the high risk/reward venture capital funding model comes with such huge expectations of rapid growth – the company must scale up fast to try to reach a high valuation – it can lead to products being oversold.
>
>“The hyperbolic AI discourse that we know from the domestic sector also happens in the military environment,” she says. The risk is that the products fielded, which often rely on hastily produced prototypes being quickly tested and improved, do not work as advertised and are flawed and unreliable in their capabilities. (Though, to be sure, such potential problems are not just limited to startups, as demonstrated by the issues that have dogged the Lockheed-manufactured F-35 fighter jet). Schwarz is particularly concerned that the acquisition of all these relatively low-cost tech products pushes the US and its allies closer to wanting to use them in war.
>
>The startups counter that an agile, iterative approach does not mean they are delivering inferior products, and checks and balances at the defence department ensure the technologies that are adopted are up to snuff. Broader acquisitions are not made until the technology has been put into the hands of operators to test, said a DIU spokesperson: “They provide the unvarnished opinion on whether [it] works as promised, addresses defence problem sets and would be useful in key scenarios.”

It remains questionable as to whether VC goals and expectations are compatible with public procurement processes, and whether features and reliability will be sufficiently addressed in this process. The claimed checks and balances at the DOD that are claimed by the startup are also part of the ""outdated"" model they're trying to disrupt and so it's likely that some of those checks might be lost with a revamping of the process. Further, with the profit-seeking by VCs, is this going to yield any savings to the public purse, or will this just funnel as much if not more public money to investors?",6,2025-03-30 16:00:47,Hrmbee

Layoff's suck, but it seems that the majority of the layoffs are focused on middle management that has plagued the tech industry, especially Intel. As an engineer in tech, it feels like nothing gets done efficiently when you have to deal with multiple layers of middle management, who's main focus, at least in my company's case, is making sure an unrealistic schedule and budget with little engineering input gets done. The MBAs with very little to no engineering background have proven to be a plague in some of the major tech companies in the US by providing or boosting unethical methods that devalue a product just to boost shareholder prices. When a company is focused on shareholder prices and pushes back on good, engineering practices, their product suffers and the valuable engineers that provide the necessary knowledge tend to leave the company (look at Boeing).

A report by the energy thinktank Ember said the milestone was powered by a boom in solar power capacity, which has doubled in the last three years.

The report found that solar farms had been the world’s fastest-growing source of energy for the last 20 consecutive years.

Phil MacDonald, Ember’s managing director, said: “Solar power has become the engine of the global energy transition. Paired with battery storage, solar is set to be an unstoppable force. As the fastest-growing and largest source of new electricity, it is critical in meeting the world’s ever-increasing demand for electricity.”

Overall, solar power remains a relatively small part of the global energy system. It made up almost 7% of the world’s electricity last year, according to Ember, while wind power made up just over 8% of the global power system.

“The largest use case for DTC genetic data was not biomedical research or research in big pharma,” Bastian Greshake Tzovaras, the founder of OpenSNP, wrote in a blog post. “Instead, the transformative impact of the data came to fruition among law enforcement agencies, who have put the genealogical properties of genetic data to use.”

OpenSNP has collected roughly 7,500 genomes over the last 14 years, primarily by allowing people to voluntarily submit their own genetic information they have downloaded from 23andMe. With the bankruptcy of 23andMe, increased interest in genetic data by law enforcement, and the return of Donald Trump and rise of authoritarian governments worldwide, Greshake Tzovaras told 404 Media he no longer believes it is ethical to run the database. 

“I’ve been thinking about it since 23andMe was on the verge of bankruptcy and been really considering it since the U.S. election. It definitely is really bad over there [in the United States],” Greshake Tzovaras told 404 Media. “I am quite relieved to have made the decision and come to a conclusion. It’s been weighing on my mind for a long time.”",20,2025-03-31 18:07:41,chrisdh79

Whenever you start typing more seriously, the laptop cpu fan goes full blash while the editor starts lagging, your typed characters do not appear for few seconds, you even get the feel the program is about to crash.
Initially there was pcs with 1 cpu core, a misbehaving program would freeze it to a halt, you had to be very patient to be able to open Task Manager to kill it.
Then hyperthreading appeared, it was more stable due to an additional virtual cpu was available and bad programs woulduse 50% of the cpu.
Then dual core and HT, giving you 4 threads, a misbehaving program would not even be noticeable, 25%cpu usage.
As core count increased, devs started making use of multiple threads, so now even a simple editor can use 4 or 8 threads and again freeze the entire system.

Windows lacks a resource governor, that would enforce per process policies, such as Outlook limited to 4 cores, ssd usage up to 50MB/sec, network use up to 2MB/sec etc.
A single program can monopolize your ssd, writing at 2GB/sec doing strange things like db compression or email archiving. This slows down your pc to a halt.

I had a misbehaving program freeze while writing an sql database and it was writing 40GBs in just a few minutes and never finishing, it would exhaust your ssd life if you would not kill it.",10,2025-04-16 06:53:12,DonutConfident7733

>
>The CVE Program is governed by a board that sets an agenda and priorities for MITRE to carry out using CISA's funding. A CISA spokesperson said on Wednesday that the contract with MITRE is being extended for 11 months. “The CVE Program is invaluable to the cyber community and a priority of CISA,” they said in a statement. “Last night, CISA executed the option period on the contract to ensure there will be no lapse in critical CVE services. We appreciate our partners’ and stakeholders’ patience.”
>
>...
>
>With the clock ticking down before this decision came out, though, some members of the CVE Program's board announced a plan to transition the project into a new nonprofit entity called the CVE Foundation.
>
>“Since its inception, the CVE Program has operated as a US government-funded initiative, with oversight and management provided under contract. While this structure has supported the program’s growth, it has also raised long-standing concerns among members of the CVE Board about the sustainability and neutrality of a globally relied-upon resource being tied to a single government sponsor,” the Foundation wrote in a statement. “This concern has become urgent following an April 15, 2025, letter from MITRE notifying the CVE Board that the US government does not intend to renew its contract for managing the program. While we had hoped this day would not come, we have been preparing for this possibility.”

>It is unclear who from the current CVE board is affiliated with the new initiative other than Kent Landfield, a longtime cybersecurity industry member who was quoted in the CVE Foundation statement. The CVE Foundation did not immediately return a request for comment.

It’s consumed globally. So it's really, really important that it continues to be a community-provided service, and we need to figure out what to do about this, because losing it would be a risk to everyone.”

> Vint Cerf, vice president and chief Internet evangelist for Google, a pioneering co-inventor of the Internet protocol and longtime leader with ICANN and the Internet Society, wrote, “On the positive side, these tools may prove very beneficial to research that needs to operate at scale ... the discovery of hazardous asteroids from large amounts of observational data, the control of plasmas using trained machine-learning models and near term, high-accuracy weather prediction. The real question is whether we will have mastered and understood the mechanisms that produce model outputs sufficiently to limit excursions into harmful behavior. It is easy to imagine that ease of use of AI may lead to unwarranted and uncritical reliance on applications. ... AI agents will become increasingly capable general-purpose assistants. We will need them to keep audit trails so we can find out what, if anything, has gone wrong and how and also to understand more fully how they work when they produce useful results. It would not surprise me to find that the use of AI-based products will induce liabilities, liability insurance and regulations regarding safety by 2035 or sooner.”

This makes no sense. These are just normal notifications coming from an app that a user has to manually install.

So let’s just walk through it.

1. A user has to download the Apple Store app
2. A user is shown a literal full screen page asking whether they want to allow notifications for their order status and also notifications for new products and offers
3. That user has to press allow notifications (twice)
4. Now a user might get marketing notifications from the Apple Store app
5. Which they can by the way fine tune in the app itself…

The regulator alleged the company’s Uber One service failed to deliver promised savings and proved difficult to “cancel anytime” as promised, according to a complaint filed in a California court on Monday.

“Americans are tired of getting signed up for unwanted subscriptions that seem impossible to cancel,” said FTC chair Andrew Ferguson. “Uber not only deceived consumers about their subscriptions, but also made it unreasonably difficult for customers to cancel.”

The FTC’s action adds to a series of lawsuits brought by successive US administrations against large technology companies. The case signals that the Trump administration will continue to clamp down on these groups despite recent overtures made by tech executives.

Uber denied the FTC’s claims and said its sign-up and cancellation processes were “clear, simple, and follow the letter and spirit of the law.”

Serbian scientists sell autoimmune disease and cancer treatment for USD 1.9 billion – Sanofi buys biopharma company Dren Bio


Pharma-major Sanofi has acquired Serbian-founded biopharmaceutical company Dren Bio for up to USD 1.9 billion.

Dren Bio is headquartered in San Francisco and it was founded by Serbian scientists.

As said in a joint statement by the companies, this acquisition is a major milestone for the Serbian biotech sector and highlights the growing international recognition of innovations emerging from the region, reports bne IntelliNews.

The agreement sees Sanofi acquire Dren Bio’s autoimmune disease treatment, DR-0201, a targeted bispecific myeloid cell activator. The drug, which has shown strong B-cell depletion in early clinical studies, is being investigated for a variety of autoimmune diseases and malignancies.

Sanofi will pay USD 600 million upfront, with the remaining amount contingent on the drug’s clinical success, reaching up to USD 1.9 billion in total.

– Deep B-cell depletion is at the frontier of treating autoimmune diseases and using the myeloid cell engager DR-0201 has the potential to elevate the treatment effect for patients, in particular patients refractory to existing treatments – said Houman Ashrafian, head of research and development at Sanofi.

Founded in 2019 by Serbian scientists Nenad Tomasevic and Ivan Trifunovic, Dren Bio is a private, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company. The name Dren reflects the company’s Serbian roots, referencing the dogwood tree, known locally for its health benefits.



Tomasevic, a graduate of the Faculty of Chemistry, is recognized as one of Serbia’s most successful entrepreneurs in biotechnology.

– It has been a privilege to advance our lead platform program, DR-0201, into clinical development. Sanofi, as a leader in immune depletion and immunology, is ideally positioned to realize the full potential of deep B-cell depletion and immune resetting for autoimmune patients – Tomasevic said.

Dren Bio has raised several rounds of venture capital. In 2022, it announced the completion of a USD 65 million Series B financing, raised its total capital received to over USD 156 million. The Series B financing was co-led by Aisling Capital and HBM Healthcare Investments alongside several new and existing investors.",5,2025-03-27 06:26:02,-43andharsh

Even when they create a weird creature, we know exactly who made it. It’s like seeing a Muppet or something from Carl Bark. In anime/manga, the Ghibli look is very different than CLAMP. I can spot a Junto Ito property from a mile away. With American comics, you can say Jim Lee and Marc Silvestri are similar but still can tell them apart. When someone bites off of Mike Mignola it’s super obvious. Jet Li didn’t want to motion capture his kung-fu because he didn’t want it stolen. His motions are uniquely his, honed and mastered over years of work. With practically everyone I listed, when you look at their early works, you can see who they’re learning from.

*“Isar Aerospace has shown that it is capable of developing a complex microlauncher in just six years. This is only possible through many parallel developments and courageous decisions. Today's maiden flight has not be launched nominally. But that doesn't mean it wasn't a success. Days like today are important to detect mistakes early on and to react quickly - which is exactly what we expect from agile companies. We are convinced that Isar Aerospace will carefully analyze the data collected from this launch attempt and gather valuable insights to improve the Spectrum rocket towards a microlauncher that will be successful on the market. As the German Space Agency, we will continue to support Isar Aerospace in this process.”*

— Dr. Walther Pelzer, DLR Executive Board Member and Director General of the German Space Agency at DLR

*“This test launch provides valuable data and is a crucial first step toward future milestones – to analyze, learn, and improve. I am sure Isar Aerospace will return stronger with another launch soon.”*

— Toni-Tolker Nielsen, ESA’s Director for Space Transportation

*“A test-flight is exactly that: a test to gather data, learn and improve. Everything Isar Aerospace achieved today is remarkable and they will have lots of data to analyse. I applaud the teams for getting this far and I am confident that we will see the next Spectrum on the launch pad ready for test-flight 2 liftoff soon.”*

Ransomware gangs, email scammers, state-sponsored spies: hacking groups come in all shapes and sizes. There are some we write about quite a bit here at WIRED, who through some combination of audacity, incompetence, or geopolitical importance—or some combination of all three—grab the spotlight in the wake of a major heist or intrusion. Then there are the groups that largely manage to stay in the shadows.

A North Korean group that specializes in crypto thefts. Industrial sabotage specialists out of Iran. Scammers from China that have probably sent you a phony text or two. Ransomware extremists that just went underground. And spies. So many spies. These stories shine a spotlight on the hacking groups you don’t hear about as often—because they’re often the ones you need to worry about the most.

Canada passed the Online News Act in 2023, requiring tech platforms to compensate Canadian publishers when they host or link to news content. In response, Meta pulled all news from Facebook and Instagram in Canada.

Disinformation risks are rising, especially with fewer fact-checks and less trusted news content

This seems like a real case study in tech policy backfiring. Instead of empowering journalism, the law may have inadvertently weakened it in the digital spaces where many Canadians get their news.

Curious to hear others’ thoughts:

Is this a regulatory failure — or just an inevitable response from tech giants protecting their models?

Can policy like this work if platforms can just opt out entirely?

What would a better solution look like — one that actually strengthens public access to trustworthy information online?",11,2025-04-12 17:04:49,erg99
