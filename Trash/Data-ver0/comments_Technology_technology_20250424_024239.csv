technology,1jlby1h,mk2e4mc,"On a recent cold afternoon, Rotem Spiegler and Gidon Ben Rivka took photos and videos of protesters at a pro-Palestinian protest at Harvard University.

The two counterdemonstrators told GBH News they were there to document what they see as pro-Hamas activists. Spiegler said she planned to turn over her photographs to Harvard officials.

“Our purpose of taking pictures is to report to the administration how those people violate the safety and the well-being of Jewish students here on campus,” Spiegler said, wearing an Israeli flag wrapped around her shoulders.

  
Harvard officials could not be reached for comment. But Spiegler and Ben Rivka’s presence is a sign of a growing effort in Massachusetts and across the country to identify and punish pro-Palestinian protesters through surveillance.

Among them, a far-right pro-Zionist organization called Betar USA has claimed credit for the arrest of Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil earlier this month. Khalil is accused of supporting Hamas and is facing deportation although he is a legal US resident. His lawyers deny the allegations, and his case is pending. He’s currently being held in a Louisiana detention center.

  
Targeting pro-Palestinian activists using cameras and AI
Betar spokesman Daniel Levy told GBH News that the organization is receiving daily reports from “Zionists” who believe they are in danger on college campuses, including those in Massachusetts.

“Yes, we are using AI technology and yes, it, we believe, led to deportations,’’ he wrote. “We continue to counter Hamas supporters and work to get them deported.”

He said they are targeting activists in the Boston area, soliciting photographic “evidence” from defenders of Israel

  
The Jew-haters are inside the building at places like Harvard University,” he wrote. “These are schools which are beyond being saved which simply aren’t safe for Jews. Massachusetts is a place where we see schools like MIT and UMass Amherst with regular Pro-Hamas events and seminars.”

technology,1jlc37o,mk2lbc4,"This is the sentence removed from the Artemis (moon) program: “NASA will land the first woman, first person of color, and first international partner astronaut on the Moon using innovative technologies to explore more of the lunar surface than ever before.”

(1) This is a program launched (with this initiative) in 2019 under Trump himself, and (2) the article title omits part of the initiative was also to get an international astronaut up there as well.  

It’s frustrating that the supporters who cheer things like this always suggest that the presence of a woman or person of color means that a more qualified white man was passed over, and that if it was truly merit-based it would mostly be white men. They would never see any bias if it was all or mostly all white men. They act like a “true merit based” decision is (1) possible (without ANY conscious or unconscious bias by the selection committees, no matter in which direction), and (2) would never result in a woman or person of color being selected over a white man. 

Each of the 42 currently active astronauts to choose from are qualified for these Artemis missions. To become an astronaut they not only meet all the academic, physical, psychological, and experience requirements - they’re the cream of the crop and highly successful people. NASA has the privilege of choosing from an incredibly qualified pool since so many apply each 4 years when they select a new batch. Whoever they pick is qualified, there’s hardly a criteria for “most-qualified” when they all have great qualifications and their own particular expertise. The four named astronauts for the first manned Artemis mission are the following:  
  
- Reid Wiseman (white man) (commander) - MS Systems Engineering, 165 days in space, Captain in the US Navy, Chief of the astronaut office    
- Christina Koch (white woman) - MS Electrical Engineering, 328 days in space    
- Victor Glover (black man) - MS Flight Test Engineering, MS Systems Engineering, Máster of Military Operational Art and Science, 167 days in space, in the Navy as a test pilot  
- Jeremy Hansen (white man, Canadian) - MS Physics, 0 days in space, “cavenaut” and “aquanaut”, royal canadian Air Force.  

 

Why would any of those people not be perfectly qualified for the mission? All the astronauts have high achieving and relevant backgrounds. It seems for this mission NASA favored military background, and in fact they often choose astronauts with military backgrounds. The only non military in this group is Christina, who has spent the most time in space of the four of them (and fun fact, she spent years doing long stints in the Arctic AND Antarctic regions, even “wintering over” in Antarctica when there’s no daylight and the bases are kept running by smaller skeleton crews with limited contact to the rest of the world. She’s got quite an interesting and accomplished background, she was on of my favorites in the past when I’ve gone down rabbit holes checking out the new astronaut classes. I was happy to see her picked!).",9,2025-03-27 20:57:54,lunadenavajas

>Google is hosting dozens of extensions in its Chrome Web Store that perform suspicious actions on the more than 4 million devices that have installed them and that their developers have taken pains to carefully conceal.
>
>The extensions, which so far number at least 35, use the same code patterns, connect to some of the same servers, and require the same list of sensitive systems permissions, including the ability to interact with web traffic on all URLs visited, access cookies, manage browser tabs, and execute scripts.
>
>...
>
>“At this point, this information should be enough for any organization to reasonably kick this out of their environment as it presents unnecessary risk,” John Tuckner, founder of browser extension analysis firm Secure Annex and the researcher who stumbled on the cluster of extensions, wrote in a post published Thursday. In an email, he said the only permission any of the 35 apps requires is management.
>
>The extensions share other dubious or suspicious similarities. Much of the code in each one is highly obfuscated, a design choice that provides no benefit other than complicating the process for analyzing and understanding how it behaves.
>
>All but one of them are unlisted in the Chrome Web Store. This designation makes an extension visible only to users with the long pseudorandom string in the extension URL, and thus, they don’t appear in the Web Store or search engine search results. It’s unclear how these 35 unlisted extensions could have fetched 4 million installs collectively, or on average roughly 114,000 installs per extension, when they were so hard to find.
>
>Additionally, 10 of them are stamped with the “Featured” designation, which Google reserves for developers whose identities have been verified and “follow our technical best practices and meet a high standard of user experience and design.”
>
>...
>
>Extension IDs and other indicators of compromise appear in Thursday's post and this spreadsheet compiled by Tuckner. Anyone who has one of these extensions installed should remove it immediately. Google didn’t immediately respond to questions asking if the company is investigating and what vetting it performed in awarding the Featured designation to some of these apps. Questions sent to some of the email addresses listed in the extension policies also didn't receive responses.

The reminder in the article is an evergreen one: ""there are real-world consequences to installing extensions for Chrome, Firefox, or any other browser, just as there are consequences for installing phone apps ... Extensions and apps should be installed only when they provide a benefit that can’t be obtained otherwise. Even then, they should be installed only after reading recent reviews to see what kind of experiences others have had and looking into the developer"". Taking a more minimalist and skeptical approach to extensions and apps can result in a more secure and ultimately more pleasant user experience overall.",28,2025-04-11 14:14:49,Hrmbee

technology,1k0hxae,mne427h,"**A hot potato:** A new study from UC San Francisco is raising alarms about the widespread use of computed tomography (CT) scans in the United States, warning that the technology may be responsible for as much as 5 percent of all cancers diagnosed each year. The research, published in JAMA Internal Medicine and funded by the National Institutes of Health, suggests that the risks associated with CT scans – particularly the exposure to ionizing radiation – are far greater than previously believed.

""CT can save lives, but its potential harms are often overlooked,"" [said](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/04/429791/popular-ct-scans-could-account-5-all-cancer-cases-year) Dr. Rebecca Smith-Bindman, the study's lead author and a UCSF radiologist. Smith-Bindman, who also serves as a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics, said there is an urgent need to reconsider current practices. ""Given the large volume of CT use in the United States, many cancers could occur in the future if current practices don't change,"" she said. ""Our estimates put CT on par with other significant risk factors, such as alcohol consumption and excess body weight. Reducing the number of scans and reducing doses per scan would save lives.""

CT scans, also known as CAT scans, have become a mainstay in modern medicine, used to detect tumors and diagnose a wide range of illnesses. Since 2007, the number of annual CT exams in the US has jumped by 30 percent. In 2023 alone, Americans underwent 93 million CT scans, a figure that researchers say could result in nearly 103,000 new cancer cases – three to four times higher than previous estimates.",31,2025-04-16 11:33:29,Smithy2232

GPT3.5's hallucination rate was ~1.9%


Gpt4's hallucination rate was ~1.8% 


Gpt4.5's hallucination rate is 1.2%


[source](https://huggingface.co/spaces/vectara/Hallucination-evaluation-leaderboard)


Larger models reduce hallucination


When you add in COT, due to the shear amount of tokens being produced you get more hallucinations but overall the end final answer is more likely to be correct, unless it's a simple Q&A trivia question in which case the hallucination doesn't have time to get ""washed out"" by more COT.


So the solution for reasoning models, simply, is to finetune the model to be  *better* at determining how long it needs to ""think"" about things.


If I ask you who was the main character in Independence Day, you'll say ""Will Smith"" in a heartbeat. If I ask Gpt4o it'll say ""Will Smith"" 99% of the time. If I ask o3, it'll think for 10-15 seconds, which introduces more room for hallucinations, and it'll say ""Will Smith"" 94% of the time. The models need to be better tuned to think 0 seconds for things that don't require thought. That's what Gemini 2.5 Pro is attempting to do and that's what GPT5 will be attempting to do.

This adds to the increasingly troubling trend of attributing false information to established media brands, illustrating how the news medium is being actively hijacked to advance Ukraine-related disinformation.

Earlier this month, Clear Story News falsely reported that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was using US taxpayer dollars to pay Western media journalists to target Trump.

Anyone who knows the math know that yes the 'reasoning' is complex and difficult to work backwards to validate. That's just the nature of these models.


Any articles referring to AI as if it has thoughts or motives should immediately be dismissed akin to DnD being a Satan worship or Harry Potter being witchcraft.",211,2025-04-11 04:17:00,tristanjones
technology,1jwh011,mmin0oa,"Before all the 'funny' redditors show up with pithy and completely useless remarks, here's what's going on.

'Reasoning' models are typically LLMs that are tuned on text that basically emulates how a person would reason through a problem in excruciating detail. Like, instead of giving the model a question-answer pair in the data, they'll give it a question-step\_1-step\_2-step\_3-alternate\_method-step\_1-step\_2-step\_2.1-step\_2.2-step\_2.3-step\_3-answer.

If you ask a reasoning model a question, the 'reasoning steps' it'll give will be *very similar* to how a normal person would work through the sane problem. And before you go off about how LLMs don't think, yeah, yeah. ""Reasoning"" is just the technical term they've been using for this particular technique.

That brings us to the article at hand. Generally reasoning models are more accurate because it generates a lot of additional 'tokens', and each token allows it to 'zero-in' on the right answer. Basically the more words it puts out the more likely it is to reach the target answer. There's no ""guessing"" here because at this point we can literally go into the neurons of an LLM and pick out the individual concepts and words its putting together for its final output.

Now, consider two inputs. Both inputs are the same question, but in one input there is a hint to the correct answer. It turns out the LLM outputs the same 'reasoning' text for both inputs, but changes the final answer based on the presence of the hint. Ignoring the bullshit Ars Technica's writing, it means the *actual problem* is that when the model is outputting 'reasoning' tokens, it's focusing on the question as a whole, but when it goes to give the final answer it suddenly laser-focuses on the 'hint'.

Why is this happening? If I had the right answer I'd be making 600k a year at some frontier lab. Most LLMs are trained in two steps - pre-training which gives it most of its abilities and post-training where it's trained to be able to interact like a person. My basic theory's that it's most likely because the model's pre-training data has a lot of direct question-answer pairs while the reasoning part was only given to it post-training (tuning), so when it sees a hint its pre-training overrides the post-training.",43,2025-04-11 05:32:06,NamerNotLiteral
technology,1jwh011,mmizcvl,"“Conceal” implies intention. There is no intention here. It is a technical implementation limitation that restricts LLM from explaining why it did something.

Here are screenshots in my original report.  [https://www.vpnmentor.com/news/report-gennomis-breach/](https://www.vpnmentor.com/news/report-gennomis-breach/) 

Cheers fellow tech peeps!",39,2025-04-01 12:47:10,OldPlastic2766
technology,1joayki,mkqde2m,"A number of the details:

>The exposed database, which was discovered by security researcher Jeremiah Fowler, who shared details of the leak with WIRED, is linked to South Korea–based website GenNomis. The website and its parent company, AI-Nomis, hosted a number of image generation and chatbot tools for people to use. More than 45 GB of data, mostly made up of AI images, was left in the open.
>
>The exposed data provides a glimpse at how AI image-generation tools can be weaponized to create deeply harmful and likely nonconsensual sexual content of adults and child sexual abuse material (CSAM). In recent years, dozens of “deepfake” and “nudify” websites, bots, and apps have mushroomed and caused thousands of women and girls to be targeted with damaging imagery and videos. This has come alongside a spike in AI-generated CSAM.
>
>“The big thing is just how dangerous this is,” Fowler says of the data exposure. “Looking at it as a security researcher, looking at it as a parent, it’s terrifying. And it's terrifying how easy it is to create that content.”
>
>Fowler discovered the open cache of files—the database was not password protected or encrypted—in early March and quickly reported it to GenNomis and AI-Nomis, pointing out that it contained AI CSAM. GenNomis quickly closed off the database, Fowler says, but it did not respond or contact him about the findings.
>
>Neither GenNomis nor AI-Nomis responded to multiple requests for comment from WIRED. However, hours after WIRED contacted the organizations, websites for both companies appeared to be shut down, with the GenNomis website now returning a 404 error page.
>
>“This example also shows—yet again—the disturbing extent to which there is a market for AI that enables such abusive images to be generated,” says Clare McGlynn, a law professor at Durham University in the UK who specializes in online- and image-based abuse. “This should remind us that the creation, possession, and distribution of CSAM is not rare, and attributable to warped individuals.”
>
>...
>
>Fowler says the database also exposed files that appeared to include AI prompts. No user data, such as logins or usernames, were included in exposed data, the researcher says. Screenshots of prompts show the use of words such as “tiny,” “girl,” and references to sexual acts between family members. The prompts also contained sexual acts between celebrities.
>
>“It seems to me that the technology has raced ahead of any of the guidelines or controls,” Fowler says. “From a legal standpoint, we all know that child explicit images are illegal, but that didn’t stop the technology from being able to generate those images.”

Once again there is a challenge with these technologies that ethics, legislation, and other potential guardrails are lagging far behind the deployment of these tools to the public. The race to be first and for public influence appears to be overruling any sense of moderation when deploying these tools, and should be fundamentally rethought for these and other technologies.",38,2025-03-31 18:59:10,Hrmbee

Be boyfriend in toxic alcoholic relationship
Get in big fight with GF. Much yelling. Neighbors call cops. 
Cops take forever to arrive, drive to store to get a handle of booze
Drive back home, drink booze out of bottle while driving. 
Park car and continue drinking. Chill out. Go back inside house. Make up with girlfriend. 

See cops pull up. GF tells them it was an argument, everything fine now , go away. 

Cops interview neighbors , who check their ring camera footage , see him on recorded video literally taking swig from a whiskey bottle as he parks the car. 

Much confusion ensues.  When police arrived, they did not observe anyone driving at all, however they were shown video of this guy drinking and driving. Much time passes as everyone calls their lawyers, supervisors, etc. no one is clear on if ring cam footage constitutes grounds for DUI arrest. 

Eventually cops decide to arrest him for dui.

PHEV sales increased by 75.7 per cent to 569,710 units. The bottom line is that 42.2 per cent of NEV passenger vehicles sold were fully electric, while 57.8 per cent were PHEVs.",9,2025-04-02 19:48:24,Wagamaga

Making creative arts accessible to everyone. Letting creatives focus on creation. They all sound great but the end of the day someone had a passion for art, animation, videography, photography etc and wanted to follow that passion only for a bunch of coders to destroy any chance of even realising it. I doubt I’ll have a job in a decades time as I will be replaced with a marketing manager with an image generator and everything will just be ai generated pigswill but no one will know because all the genuine creators will just be lost in the noise.

I saw an app that can take the signature style of the great masters Van Gogh, constable, Monet and picasso etc and at a click create anything in that style. I often wonder if the implementation of these ai advances discourages the pursuit of the craft. I used to do a lot of photo manipulation art but now my frame of mind is what’s the point.

I worry about company managements accepting ai swill as good enough for the price and genuine creatives get pushed aside or the creative opportunities dry up.

technology,1jm2g9c,mkdgqt2,"Anyone who thinks that this erodes ghibli's brand has never understood what makes their movies unique. 

Their art style certainly was unique, but what made them special was their plots and characters. No real villains, everyone with a human motive, and exploring what it means to be human or to grow up in a world filled with complex characters. 

Consider any Ghibli movie that has a "" bad guy"" and compare it with a Disney movie's bad guy. All the Disney villains are pretty one-dimensional; they exist to be evil, and there doesn't need to be very much logic behind it. The stepmother is jealous: that encompasses who she is. 

When you look at a Ghibli villain like Lady Eboshi from Princess Mononoke, you find a complex character who is motivated by protecting her people. She cares for the lepers, and those under her charge; and yet she's pushing for an ecological disaster. You can't say that the world would necessarily be better off without her, but you can say that some of her motives are flawed. 

Or consider Nausicaa; The leader of the Tolmekians is not an evil person, she just has a somewhat nihilistic outlook. But she is a good leader, she's practical, and she doesn't necessarily wish anyone ill. She's just faced with an intractable enemy and trying to find a solution which leads her to a fairly horrific plan. Even the background evil that they're all facing-- the toxic jungle, and the Great warrior-- exist for a reason that can't be called  evil.

In all of his movies, you find a love of nature, which is reflected in the artwork. People are less detailed than the world around them, and that lends to a fairly unique art style. But just replicating the art style does not create studio Ghibli work, and I think we're a very, very long way away from worrying about AI replicating what makes Ghibli special.",10,2025-03-29 16:06:55,Coffee_Ops

Drug pumps, anesthesia machines, CT & Xray machines, respirators…. They could be compromised with viruses or remote control that kill people outright.

technology,1jjkcyr,mjnoexs,"From the article: The UK’s Consumer Markets Authority (CMA) has provided an update into its investigation of Ticketmaster after the sale of Oasis reunion tour tickets resulted in grossly inflated ticket prices and numerous consumer complaints. The CMA said that the results of the investigation warranted, “consulting with the ticketing platform on changes to ensure fans receive the right information, at the right time.”

Of concern to the CMA was Ticketmaster’s labeling and information practices. In its update, the CMA stated that Ticketmaster designated certain tickets as “platinum,” selling them at more than twice the standard price without adequately informing consumers that the increased price did not correspond to better seats or other perks. The CMA also took issue with Ticketmaster’s handling of standing room tickets. It explained that the company sold off a cheaper category of standing ticket first then surprised buyers waiting in extensive online queues with a more expensive ticket.

According to the CMA, it is working with Ticketmaster to ensure this doesn’t happen again. “We’re concerned that Oasis fans didn’t get the information they needed or may have been misled into buying tickets they thought were better than they were,” said Hayley Fletcher, interim senior director of consumer protection. “We now expect Ticketmaster to work with us to address these concerns so, in future, fans can make well-informed decisions when buying tickets.”",17,2025-03-25 14:15:30,chrisdh79

On the dev side, they were incompetent, and had no interest in learning. They spent all their time trying to get us to do their work. What they wrote was full of misspellings and senseless naming conventions. Good luck finding that function! What data does ""MyVar"" hold? 

On the support side, they were incompetent, and had no interest in learning. They spent all their time trying to get us to do their work. Because the dev teams were so shitty, the support tickets skyrocketed. They didn't understand the client's questions, the client couldn't understand the tech's response. The tickets were completely devoid of any information. Just ""The issue has been fixed"", sent back to the client, who sends it back the next day ""Not it's not"", and 2 days later, no notes, ""The issue has been fixed"". Guess what? Wasn't. Clients were screaming mad, losing hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars due to their inability to run the software. We started losing support contracts (generally custom work) worth millions of dollars. We lost our first client in 15 years in the first 6 months. Then started losing more.

Within 8 months, the rest of us left. all but 1 dev architect, all but 2 senior devs, and more than half of our support techs. The Product team, which worked very closely with clients, collapsed because the dev and support teams were making their job impossible. I'd say less than 20% of our entire company knowledge base remained by the end of the year. Even half of management, which had been there since 1999, left in droves.

I crossed paths with the company the next year, and it was a sad mess. A few familiars still there, but obviously on their way out. They lost so many clients.

technology,1jlsf5n,mk5xkuz,"SS: India is advocating for reduced compliance requirements for cross-border payments made through its Unified Payments Interface (UPI) to expand its international reach and compete with networks like Visa, Mastercard, and SWIFT. UPI, launched in 2016, has grown rapidly, handling 83% of India's digital payments in 2024, up from 34% in 2019. The government aims to make UPI usable for Indians traveling abroad and tap into the global payments market.

Currently, UPI faces stricter compliance under the Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) ""travel rule,"" which mandates financial institutions to collect and transmit sender and receiver details for cross-border payments. This rule is less stringent for established global card networks and SWIFT, creating a competitive disadvantage for UPI. India raised the issue at an FATF conference, seeking technology-neutral rules for cross-border payments.

India has already signed agreements with seven countries, including France and Singapore, enabling UPI-based payments abroad. A decision on easing FATF compliance will depend on consensus among member countries after the public consultation period ends on April 18, 2025.

This push aligns with India's strategy to strengthen its payments infrastructure globally and reduce reliance on foreign networks, potentially boosting the adoption of UPI internationally.",37,2025-03-28 11:03:15,BROWN-MUNDA_

A SNAKE NAMED NATE

||
||
|Once upon a time there was a snake named Nate who lived in the woods. There was a road which wound through the woods. Nate liked to lie because it caught the sun and warmed his bones. Very near this road in these woods there was a tree -- special tree. It was special because on the side of the tree there was a lever -- and if the lever were pushed, then the world would end. One day Granny was driving through the woods in her jalopy. Granny was a tendered-hearted soul who would never hurt a fly. As usual, Nate was lying on the road, sunning himself. As Granny came along, she didn't see Nate at first. Then, when she did see him, it was almost too late. She swerved to to avoid hitting him. When she swerved, she lost control of her jalopy and she crashed into a tree -- the special tree with the lever ... and the lever got pushed ... and the world ended. Moral to the story: Better Nate than lever.|",-45,2025-03-30 02:42:13,AppleTree98

technology,1k55ts0,mofh84o,"Thanks for sharing this! Here's a bit from the article: 

Nvidia’s GPU drivers have been a disaster over the past four months. It all started when Nvidia released its drivers for the RTX 50-series cards in January, and introduced black screen issues, game crashes, and general stability problems for new and existing graphics cards. Now, yet another new hotfix has emerged to fix even more issues introduced by Nvidia’s buggy drivers.

The 576.02 driver released last week, which included lots of bug and crash fixes, seemed like it would finally solve the issues that have plagued Nvidia’s driver releases over the past few months, but it has made things worse for some. Posters in the Nvidia forums have been reporting issues with GPU monitoring utilities not reporting the correct GPU temperatures since installing 576.02, so Nvidia was forced to release a hotfix driver yesterday to address this issue.

The latest 576.15 hotfix also includes fixes for lower idle GPU clock speeds for RTX 50-series owners, and some fixes for certain games flickering after updating to last week’s 576.02 driver. I would highly recommend installing this hotfix driver if you’re on an RTX 50-series GPU or you regularly set your PC to sleep mode and use GPU monitoring utilities like Afterburner to control a custom fan curve based on GPU temperatures.

technology,1jpckmw,mkz7w62,"But what is the reason we bought a PS5? Or why should we buy a PS6 in a few years? Already with the PS5 i feel I mostly play games that look only marginally better than what i was playing on a PS4. Most gamestudio’s already gave up on graphics. EA doesn’t really invest in their dated Frostbite game engine.

Instead of stop caring about ‘cutting-edge graphics’ I rather see studios stop making humongous games. That’s where the real big savings are. I don’t need 60-100 hour games that take years to make. Make way shorter games (that do look amazing!)  if we’re talking about single player adventures for example. If I played a game that takes around 12 hours to complete that’s fine. Make the games a bit cheaper as well for us consumers because 80 euro games I don’t buy as often anymore.

It’s weird if the entire industry collectively says this is were the evolution stops. ‘Sorry folks, this is it. Better graphics than this you shall never have.’ Besides we already have Nintendo for that.

I strongly oppose porn, but using the existence of porn sites as an excuse to track Internet users and access their government ID is a mistake.

There are companies out there, such as Running with the Sun (not putting their real name in case it violates rules) that ""lease"" you the solar panels.  They'll install it and put in the least amount of panels, despite what your monthly usage is. Charge you a monthly fee that doesn't even offset the savings by using solar.  They only recently started providing the option for a PowerWall from Tesla, but the average user ends up paying more in the end.

Over 25 years, you're paying for the panels and supposedly the maintenance, but check reviews. You'll see these people have been scammed and hard.  Ice and snow buildup on your panels? Should have upgraded the package to include that.  Some report having multiple panels that aren't even working after installation.  Then, to top it all off, if you ever want to sell but are stuck in the lease, you have to try to get the new homeowner to take over that lease.  Good luck.

If you can afford the initial cost of owning solar outright, then yes, solar will save you money, if and only if you also store that excess energy produced during the day. Otherwise, it's an investment that will not save you money, only offset your carbon footprint.

technology,1jqtr62,ml9l40e,"A number of key portions from this report:

>U.S. Customs and Border Protection is planning to modernize older video surveillance towers in Arizona that provide the agency an unblinking view of the border. A key part of the effort is adding machine-learning capabilities to CBP cameras, allowing the agency to automatically detect humans and vehicles as they approach the border without continuous monitoring by humans. CBP is purchasing computer vision powers from two vendors, IBM and Equitus. Google, the documents show, will play a critical role stitching those services together by operating a central repository for video surveillance data.
>
>...
>
>Tying together these machine learning surveillance tools is Google, which the document reveals is supplying CBP with a cloud computing platform known as MAGE: the ModulAr Google Cloud Platform Environment. Based on the document, Google is providing a hub for video surveillance data and will directly host the Equitus AI analysis tool. It appears every camera in CBP’s Tucson Sector will pipe data into Google servers: “This project will focus initially on 100 simultaneous video streams from the data source for processing,” the document reads, and “the resulting metadata and keyframes will be sent to CBP’s Google Cloud.”
>
>The diagram also notes that one of Google’s chief rivals, Amazon Web Services, provides CBP with unspecified cloud computing services.
>
>...
>
>In a statement provided to The Intercept, Google Public Sector executive Jim Kelly attempted to distance the company slightly from the border surveillance work. “CBP has been public about how it has a multicloud strategy and has used Google Cloud for work like translation,” Kelly wrote. “In this case, Google Cloud is not on the contract. That said, customers or partners can purchase Google Cloud’s off-the-shelf compute, storage, and networking products for their own use, much like they might use a mobile network or run their own computer hardware.”
>
>Kelly’s statement indicates the government is acquiring Google Cloud services through a reseller, as is common in federal procurement. But Kelly’s comparison of Google Cloud technology to buying off-the-shelf computer hardware is misleading. Even if it’s supplied through a subcontractor or reseller, CBP’s use of Google’s service still requires a constant and ongoing connection to the company’s cloud infrastructure. Were Google still serious about “not working on any projects associated with immigration enforcement at the southern border,” as Kurian claimed in 2020, it would be trivial to prevent CBP from using Google Cloud.
>
>...
>
>“On top of the wasted tax dollars, border communities end up paying the price with their privacy, as demonstrated by the recent findings by the Government Accountability Office that CBP had failed to implement six out of six key privacy policy requirements,” Dave Maass, director of investigations at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told The Intercept, referring to the tower program’s dismal privacy protections record. “For more than two decades, surveillance towers at the border have proven to be a boondoggle, and adding AI isn’t going to make it any less of a boondoggle — it will just be an AI-powered boondoggle.”

It's pretty clear that Google, like most other big tech companies, is more than happy to gorge on public money, regardless of how problematic the work might be. Their half-hearted attempts to distance themselves from the work are the thinnest veneer over what could cause some pushback by customers or employees.

technology,1jne0kv,mkixt22,">The section on “AI Perception vs. Reality”, chaired by MIT computer scientist Rodney Brooks, referenced the Gartner Hype Cycle characterization, a five-stage cycle common for technology hype. In November 2024, Gartner “estimated that hype for Generative AI had just passed its peak and was on the downswing,” the report noted. 79% of respondents in the community opinion section stated that current public perceptions of AI’s capabilities do not match the reality of AI research and development, with 90% saying that the mismatch is hindering AI research—74% of that number saying that “the directions of AI research are driven by the hype.”

“Overall, the responses indicate a cautious yet forward-moving approach: AI researchers prioritize safety, ethical governance, benefit-sharing, and gradual innovation, advocating for collaborative and responsible development rather than a race toward AGI,” the report wrote.

AI is not going anywhere; after all, the Gartner Hype Cycle doesn’t end with “fade into oblivion,” but instead the “plateau of productivity.” Different arenas of AI use cases have different levels of hype, but with all the clamor about AI—from the private sector, from government officials, heck, from our own families—the report is a refreshing reminder that AI researchers are thinking very critically about the state of their field. From the way AI systems are built to the ways they are deployed in the world, there is room for innovation and improvement.

GWB then proceeded to squander that surplus in the form of a tax cut that ate up the entire projected surplus and then some, and also started the war in Iraq without any valid justification, putting it all on the government's credit card and carrying the balance until Obama inherited the mess.

The rants about using other systems and DIY highlights how the market is changing for the consumer grade NAS boxes. You now have a lot more to select from than you did five years ago.",-4,2025-04-22 07:52:28,Bob_Spud
technology,1k4yogh,modvvij,"According to a different article, you could keep using other drives, you just wouldn't have access to certain features. Most of which were probably no big loss for consumer level devices. 

Guess we'll have to wait for things to shake out to find out if it's Synology branded drives or nothing, or just some bullshit about not being able to use certain features.",-25,2025-04-22 05:28:06,FreddyForshadowing
technology,1k4yogh,mogtaso,"This thread is a cesspool of the confidently ignorant - Synology has over 13m systems, which would imply over 25 million drives under management in its fleet. Doing this reliably and securely with untrusted hardware and zero control over the firmware is complex in a very expensive way. That cost is extracted from the consumer, eventually. 

Yes, it could possibly be a cash grab, but it’s probably not. If they’ve decided to take little to no profit from their drives, this will be a net win for both synology and consumers, allowing them to increase reliability of their platforms, and allow them to deliver features that can only be delivered in a trusted supply chain.",-4,2025-04-22 17:41:07,babwawawa

Maria desperately banged on the door as she pleaded through tears for her 15-year-old daughter Trinity to come out.

“Look what they've done to me,” Trinity said as she finally unlocked the door in their Red Deer, Alta., home, lifting her shirt to reveal the myriad of usernames and symbols, including a swastika, carved into her skin.

“I can't take this anymore.”

  
Just moments before, Trinity was livestreaming her attempt to kill herself on a private Discord server while dozens of predators goaded her on.

It was July 11, 2021, and the culmination of months of exploitation by members of a violent extremist group called 764 who prey on vulnerable minors and lure them into their dark and depraved online community.

Ubisoft is going to win here just as they did in the UK. If you’re dislike live service games you pay up front to play… don’t. You have that right as a consumer to spend your money elsewhere.
