An updated 1982 recording (from his album *The Change Has Come*) was retitled ""T-82"", and in the 1990s, he recorded a [country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music) version. In the late 1970s, he recorded a new version that, except for the sound mix and some minor arrangement changes, was identical to the 1960 original; as a result this later version is often misidentified on compilations as the original recording. In 1988, he joined [The Fat Boys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fat_Boys) on a rap version of the song, which hit number 2 in the UK, number 16 in the US, and number 1 in Germany and Switzerland. Checker also joined the group to perform the song that summer at [a London tribute concert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela_70th_Birthday_Tribute) for [Nelson Mandela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela).[^(\[17\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twist_(song)#cite_note-stars-17) In addition, he recorded variations on the theme, such as ""[Let's Twist Again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let%27s_Twist_Again)"" to keep the craze alive (""Let's Twist Again"" was and has remained more popular than ""The Twist"" itself in the United Kingdom).",21,2025-04-01 11:19:07,solinvicta

The songs are wonderfully short but powerful jaunts, with some eternally killer riffs. 

The solos imo are some of the best solos in all of metal. Theres not a pretty melody to be heard. Every second of soloing is completely blistering. It almost reminds me of free jazz.

And unless you’re willing to help get the lesser of two evils into power and then do your best to steer them in the right direction, you’re helping the worse of two evils come to power.

Like, throw some darts at a newspaper and tell me that even half the crises you land on would’ve been happening if the other side were in charge.

I’ve been on board since Emma, and I think it’s maybe just because I’m roughly the same age as him, but he has this knack for releasing albums that hit me right where I am in my life at that point. I still think *22, a Million* is his most striking album, and I love the widescreen, pastoral vibe of his s/t, but this one just feels cozy in the way that I need right now. On the first few listens, there aren’t any real show stoppers on the level Holocene or 33 “God” (or 666 upsidedowncross, or 8(circle) or pretty much any other song on that album or even a “Hey, Ma” or “Faith”), but it’s got a fantastic vibe.

In a way, it feels like Vampire Weekend’s Only God Was Above Us from last year. It’s deeply entrenched in his past albums, while being something completely new.

Non “Evanescence head” here. They’re great, but when I’m in the mood for hi gain guitars, I want something harder. Just me. 

I did listen to Metallica enough to have my favorite albums and my least fav era. Personally, Hardwired to Self Destruct is new Metallica that sounds enough like the eras I loved. It scratches the “Metallica itch.” This sounds to me, like it would do the same if I were an Evanescence fanboy. Plus there’s a lyrical thematic congruence to their big hit Back to Life but with a new perspective.

The Velvet Underground & Nico, didn't enjoy it before listening to their third album, now my favorite band ever

loveless - my bloody valentine, thought it was just bunch of random noise thrown in together, after developing an obsession with shoegaze, (Blue Rev - Alvvays and To See the Next Part of the Dream - Parannoul was all I was listening to) I finally realized it was genius and it's now in my top 10 albums ever

Unknown Pleasures - Joy Division, thought it was boring at first and only liked Disorder from it, I don't know what changed within me but I love it now, I hope the same thing happens with Closer

For the First Time - Black Country, New Road, absolutely loved Ants From Up There, and got disappointed that their debut album was very far from Ants, after a while, I learned to appreciate Sunglasses then the whole album

Hellfire - black midi, listened to it because of BCNR, and thought it was way too technical and complicated for me, then after getting into FTFT, this clicked with me simultaneously

While the song explores philosophical themes, the title sparks controversy, with the band facing accusations of racism that linger for decades. Frontman Robert Smith repeatedly clarifies that the lyrics are purely literary, but misinterpretations force the band to issue disclaimers and alter lyrics in later performances.

music,1jith30,mjhte99,"Avant-garde is the better word.  Late 70s art-rock, borrowed from the glam rock movement, took it to a theatrical approach in-concert, and they were a blast to see live.  I do think they tried to set that aside a bit and get into the mainstream, and this was around the same time as Devo was getting a bit more attention.  She's a Beauty (1983) was a MTV hit, but their first attempt at a breakthrough was the unfortunate choice to be in Xanadu, along with Gene Kelly, the guy from The Warriors, roller-skating and Olivia Newton-John.

The Tubes aren't for everyone, and while I do think they were best seen live, I sort of put them in a slot with Devo, J. Geils Band, and Utopia (bands I've seen live), where I can enjoy their work, even if it's a bit dated, but I do think the live concert is what drove both my enjoyment and their reputation.  Fee was quite the showman.

The song's lyrics reflect themes of insight and deception, as the narrator uses sunglasses as a metaphor for seeing through someone's dishonest actions.

music,1jts3wy,mlwk8jp,"Stop listening to it then!

Put it on a shelf and look for new things to make you feel like that again. 

It’s a weird feeling for sure - to have an album that you swear you could listen to forever and always love it, and one day…you don’t. 

I’ve “shelved” Dark Side, Random Access Memories, Alive 2007, Abbey Road, Magical Mystery Tour, Sgt. Pepper (actually probably all of The Beatles now that I think of it), My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, and Hyperdrama (just to name a few quick-to-mind albums). I thought they were all great and can recall them note-for-note when they’re on, but I don’t get that same feeling I used to like when I was younger. Sometimes the itch itches and I’ll throw one on and enjoy every moment, but the time has got to be right for me to get that same “feeling”. 

You can’t listen to it again for the first time, which is a crying shame. Let it fade away a bit in to your memories, and drag it back out when you forget it a bit more. 

The good news: you get to go find new songs, albums, and artists in a search for that “new thing”.

His appearances on the award shows had kids lining up for his sparkly glove and the red leather jacket was on everyone's wish list. Moonwalks for days at school and doing some of the dance moves from his shows. He was a true superstar where fans lost their minds trying to get a glimpse and people all over the world knew tunes from Thriller.

The closest comparison today would maybe be someone like Trump or Elon Musk that even if you do not have any interest in politics you still know who they are and you know a little bit about them. The difference though is MJ was famous but those guys are infamous.",28,2025-03-25 15:03:05,inkyblinkypinkysue
music,1jjlatz,mjo9e52,"I think there were several things.

First, everyone loved the music; it crossed every possible line from R&B (Human Nature) to Pop (PTY) to Rock.  Steve Luthacker (Toto Fame) and Eddie Van Halen were ""Beat It"".  6 or 7 songs were constantly on the radio/MTV/VH1 (remember, no streaming back then).

Second, MJ spent millions and created long version videos, like ""Thriller"", with Vincent Price.  He was fighting to get on MTV, so he had a legal and artistic point to make.  The MTV releases became epic, life-altering experiences.  It took the whole ""video"" production to a new level.  This included choreography (Beat It, Thriller, etc) and that changed how an actual concert was played & presented.  Every pop star from Shakira to Dupa Lupa to Tay-Tay Swifty have elements of MJ in their shows.  All of them...

Third, he didn't limit it to just video; he was constantly stretching the choreography and using it live.  His Moonwalk at the Motown 25th Anniversary was insane.  He was singing, dancing, clearly huffing & puffing like a basketball player running the floor, and out of nowhere comes the Moonwalk.  It was just mind-breaking if you saw it in person; you literally had to double-take and WTF that whole situation.

Then he was just everywhere all the time.  His fame took on such an epic proportion and his wealth hit insane levels that everyone wanted a piece of him...all the time.  He followed ""Thriller"" up with ""Bad"", which was a decent album in its own right, and was literally in the public eye every day for years...1983 to 1990, when I was in college tending bar and he was on VH1/MTV all-the-friggin'-time (eg. Black & White)...",8,2025-03-25 16:00:51,feder_online

music,1jjlatz,mjo0mmq,"I was in 7th grade when Thriller came out. Everyone had the album or cassette tape. Pretty much everyone was an MJ fan but this album was so incredibly different than his Off The Wall album several years before. Every. Single. Song hit. Most of that album were played at out Halloween and class dance/prom. PYT and Billie Jean were the singles most students danced to at our talent show that spring. It was really a superb album in every way! I got my album for Christmas, 1982 and I listened to it daily.",3,2025-03-25 15:17:56,TheVampireDuchess
music,1jjlatz,mjoe8xa,"This is a bit of apples to oranges, but it was kind of a perfect storm. Michael already had a bunch of hits and fame with the Jackson 5, then some solo success (Off The Wall). But it was very akin to the Justin Timberlake spike in popularity. He left the boy band and hooked up with Quincy Jones, so his sound changed considerably. A lot of the Thriller success was Quincy, because he really fused a lot of different genres together, which was entirely fresh for radio and the new MTV at the time. This also made his brand of music much more accessible to many different generations all at once. He was the hippest as far as being fresh, but also held public admiration for people like Fred Astaire and Elizabeth Taylor from previous generations. MJ was already known as a great dancer and live performer before Thriller. 


But because of songs like Beat It (which featured Eddie Van Halen), Billie Jean, and of course, Thriller - COMBINED with Michael's dancing and good looks, it was a ""stars aligning"" to create a zeitgeist. 


Not only was he a great singer, but he was in his prime 20's and became an elite dancer/performer. The visuals that went along with his music (choreography and fashion) and how unique the music was for the time - just sent him into the stratosphere. Arguably, creating a reputation as the best singer in the world, the best dancer in the world, the cutest guy in the world, the coolest music videos in the world, and the most popular music in the world. Other artists could stake a partial claim to one or two of those things, but prime Michael Jackson was all of them.

music,1jjlatz,mjo8lge,"Allmusic sums it up nicely...

>Off the Wall was a massive success, spawning four Top Ten hits (two of them number ones), but nothing could have prepared Michael Jackson for Thriller. Nobody could have prepared anybody for the success of Thriller, since the magnitude of its success was simply unimaginable -- an album that sold 40 million copies in its initial chart run, with seven of its nine tracks reaching the Top Ten (for the record, the terrific ""Baby Be Mine"" and the pretty good ballad ""The Lady in My Life"" are not like the others). This was a record that had something for everybody, building on the basic blueprint of Off the Wall by adding harder funk, hard rock, softer ballads, and smoother soul -- expanding the approach to have something for every audience. That alone would have given the album a good shot at a huge audience, but it also arrived precisely when MTV was reaching its ascendancy, and Jackson helped the network by being not just its first superstar, but first black star as much as the network helped him. This all would have made it a success (and its success, in turn, served as a new standard for success), but it stayed on the charts, turning out singles, for nearly two years because it was really, really good. True, it wasn't as tight as Off the Wall -- and the ridiculous, late-night house-of-horrors title track is the prime culprit, arriving in the middle of the record and sucking out its momentum -- but those one or two cuts don't detract from a phenomenal set of music. It's calculated, to be sure, but the chutzpah of those calculations (before this, nobody would even have thought to bring in metal virtuoso Eddie Van Halen to play on a disco cut) is outdone by their success.

Automatically takes me back to a dock somewhere on one of the islands in Parry Sound, Ontario. Was up there with a bunch of friends. We rented a cottage and ended up partying with the airBnB host and a bunch of their friends. Middle of August, calm water and not a single cloud in a candy blue sky. Every time I hear that tune I immediately think of that setting with life long friends.",13,2025-03-27 00:07:47,Yoskiee

My best mate and my sister used to wander around drinking when we were teens in the early 90s. 

He was a bit geeky and had a watch with an alarm that he'd set for 10:15 if we were out on a Saturday night and the three of us would sing it into the sky whilst marching down the road without a care in the world.

It a big song, starts out with a lot of intensity and builds all the way to the end.  It's like punching the gas, as the turbo builds you're at 145 MPH before I realize it. No way to escape that rush, you feel exhilarated no matter how down you felt.",3,2025-03-27 01:54:17,R-T-R

music,1jihkae,mlaryxu,"I think this newest album is a masterpiece and right up there with sunbather or OCHL. However, I think people’s perception of how incredible it is will unfortunately be tamped down by the fact that it’s following infinite granite so people instead will just label it a “return to form album”. 

I always compare this band to Godspeed You Black Emperor and while I love Godspeed earliest work, similar to how I love sunbather, I feel like deafheavens newest album is the start of a really amazing era of their music…similar to how Godspeed newest albums pushed them to new areas that their original albums couldn’t conceive of. 

It’s a 10/10 for me and so happy their back",1,2025-04-04 00:59:19,Sad_Championship1493
music,1jihkae,mjfhuva,"Really excited to hear this one. All of the teasers give me hope it will be their most cohesive album since Sunbather. New Bermuda was good. But it felt kind of pasted together, where the first two albums flow really well, even just on a single song level. Then they dropped Ordinary Corrupt Human Love, which most fans love but I thought was a mess. You Without End is the worst thing they've done and all of the clean vocal songs were forgettable. It just felt like another album of random ideas that don't really work together. They tried to strike a balance with their light and dark sides that didn't land. Infinite Granite on the other hand was very cohesive but it wasn't a very remarkable shoegaze/dream pop album. What I've heard of the new album seems to be doing a great job of mixing their light and dark sides. If they can pull it together, this will probably be one of my favorite albums from them.",1,2025-03-24 04:34:37,debtRiot
