technology,1jtnthj,mlvnami,"Trump this morning threatened to impose 50% tariffs on China because they retaliated for his tariffs.  This will definitely impact Switch 2 prices, thus Nintendo is smart to delay US pricing until this is resolved:

technology,1jtnthj,mlvsndd,"Thanks for sharing our piece. Here's a snippet for some context: 

In the run-up to the [Switch 2 launch](https://www.wired.com/story/this-is-the-nintendo-switch-2/), part of [Nintendo](https://www.wired.com/tag/nintendo/)’s focus has been on ensuring it can meet the demands of an audience hungry for a new console. And that new system comes with a [hefty price](https://www.wired.com/story/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-pre-orders/)—$450—which could [go up even more](https://www.wired.com/story/nintendo-delays-switch-2-pre-orders-over-trump-tariffs/) due to [President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs](https://www.wired.com/story/trump-global-tariffs-tech-industry-impacts/).

But in an interview a day after Trump’s announcement, Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser told WIRED the tariffs “weren’t factored into the pricing” of the console.

The company is “actively assessing” the situation and its impact, he adds. “It creates a challenge,” Bowser says. “It’s something we're going to have to address.”announced last week.

My theory is that being from Auckland we got hit really hard by COVID lockdowns and then when they came back to school they'd all got so used to being on their phones that they had kind of forgotten some of the fun stuff they could be doing otherwise.  Learning how to play etc.

technology,1jw0iyq,mmeheie,"Throughout 2024—the so-called “year of elections”—when half the world’s population went to the ballot box, there was a tussle between authoritarianism and democracy that played to a relative draw. Troublingly, one throughline in all the elections has been the growing use of disinformation—false information intended to mislead—by illiberal leaders, both from abroad and increasingly from within democracies themselves. 

Vice President J.D. Vance and President Donald Trump’s Oval Office table-turning on Volodymyr Zelensky in February—casting him, not Vladimir Putin, as the obstacle to peace in Ukraine—is just the latest example of the purposeful misdirection and disinformation pedaled by our own elected leaders. Weeks earlier, Vance had stunned European leaders at the Munich Security Conference with his “world upside down” rhetoric, accusing them of being a threat to democracy for guarding against the menace of disinformation campaigns, mainly from Russia. 

Russia’s disinformation campaigns target both post-Communist countries (Czechia, Romania) and established democracies like Germany and Austria. Meanwhile, China targets U.S. and Canadian elections with pro-CCP disinformation, and Iran creates fake news outlets to influence American voters.  

But as dangerous to democracy as the outside-in authoritarian meddling, perhaps worse (and more disturbing) is the increasing use of disinformation from actors within once-stable democracies. Countries with strong histories of free speech and the free flow of information, like the United Kingdom, saw riots last fall when disinformation about immigrant violence was used to stoke fear. In Germany, the spread of conspiracy theories sparked violent acts, like the attack on the Reichstag and the plot to overthrow the government during the pandemic. Trump won in the U.S. aided by similar disinformation. His ally, Elon Musk, turned Twitter into a propaganda machine, spreading untruths. Trump and allies fabricated and disseminated stories of an influx of immigrant asylum escapees from Haiti eating pets in Ohio—patently false information with no goal but to kindle real fears of immigrants among voters.",99,2025-04-10 15:22:18,Wagamaga

If they don't think they're going to be lifted relatively quickly though I don't really see another option other than a substantial price increase, this increase would likely spread somewhat to other countries as well over time to soften the blow of what directly applying those tariffs to the US cost would look like. Probably not directly in the cost of the system, but wouldn't shock me to see things like a global increase of $10 or the equivalent per year to both tiers of their subscription service or something like that. It sucks and is unfair for non-US countries, but generally in global markets you maximize profit by spreading out the cost of a single regions price shooting up like this.

technology,1jup68u,mm6lfpq,"Building iPhones entirely in America would significantly increase costs, though exact estimates vary. Based on available analyses:

The manufacturing cost increase would likely be in the range of $100-200 per device. This is primarily due to:

1. Labor costs: US manufacturing wages are roughly 5-10 times higher than in China and other Asian manufacturing centers

2. Supply chain relocation: The entire ecosystem of component suppliers, which is heavily concentrated in Asia, would need to be replicated or relocated

3. Infrastructure investment: New factories, equipment, and training would require substantial upfront capital

4. Loss of scale economies: The existing manufacturing infrastructure in places like Zhengzhou, China (sometimes called “iPhone City”) is massive and highly optimized

Some analyses suggest the retail price might increase by approximately 20-35%, though Apple could potentially absorb some of this increase to maintain competitive pricing.

There would be offsetting benefits like reduced shipping costs, potential tax incentives, and elimination of tariffs, but these wouldn’t fully compensate for the higher labor and operational costs.

It’s worth noting that Apple has gradually diversified some production to countries like India and Vietnam, but complete reshoring to the US remains challenging due to these economic factors.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",5,2025-04-09 09:19:01,Glidepath22

technology,1jo2o22,mkorqt8,"Berlin. The Federation of German Industries ( BDI ) has warned of major uncertainties for companies if US President Donald Trump overturns the legal basis for data transfers between the EU and the US .

""Reliable and legally secure transatlantic data traffic is essential for German industry,"" BDI board member Iris Plöger told Handelsblatt. Should the so-called EU-US Data Privacy Framework fail, ""it would have devastating consequences for companies and authorities and would lead to considerable additional effort and legal uncertainty.""

The current agreement between Brussels and Washington is based on commitments made by the US government by then-President Joe Biden in an executive order. However, such an order can be revoked. This often happens when a new president takes office or political priorities change. What is worrying for the business community is that Trump announced after taking office that he would review his predecessor's security policy decisions.

This would also affect the data agreement with the EU, because it interferes with the workings of the US intelligence services. The deal severely restricted the services' extensive access to personal data transferred from the EU to companies in the US. Only this makes it possible to carry out data transfers in a legally compliant manner.

This is highly relevant for companies. Whether it's customer data from online shops or sensitive industrial data, Europe is in many cases dependent on cloud storage from the US: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft, and Google dominate the cloud-based IT infrastructure business. The analysis firm Synergy estimates their market share in Europe at 70 percent. None of their European competitors account for more than two percent.H+

The European Court of Justice has already struck down transatlantic data agreements twice
The German Chamber of Industry and Commerce (DIHK) also fears ""serious consequences"" should Trump overturn the data agreement. ""Companies of all sizes – from corporations to startups – would face legal uncertainty and, in some cases, liability risks,"" DIHK Chief Legal Officer Stephan Wernicke told Handelsblatt.

The legal framework for companies on both sides of the Atlantic, which has now been in effect for almost two years, was considered an important breakthrough after the European Court of Justice (ECJ) had only annulled the transatlantic ""Safe Harbor"" agreement in 2015 and its successor, the ""Privacy Shield"", in 2020.",120,2025-03-31 14:10:33,tuttut97

technology,1jtneu7,mlvgltk,"From the article: Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has plans to stage a “hackathon” next week in Washington, DC. The goal is to create a single “mega API”—a bridge that lets software systems talk to one another—for accessing IRS data, sources tell WIRED. The agency is expected to partner with a third-party vendor to manage certain aspects of the data project. Palantir, a software company cofounded by billionaire and Musk associate Peter Thiel, has been brought up consistently by DOGE representatives as a possible candidate, sources tell WIRED.

Two top DOGE operatives at the IRS, Sam Corcos and Gavin Kliger, are helping to orchestrate the hackathon, sources tell WIRED. Corcos is a health-tech CEO with ties to Musk’s SpaceX. Kliger attended UC Berkeley until 2020 and worked at the AI company Databricks before joining DOGE as a special adviser to the director at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Corcos is also a special adviser to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.

Since joining Musk’s DOGE, Corcos has told IRS workers that he wants to pause all engineering work and cancel current attempts to modernize the agency’s systems, according to sources with direct knowledge who spoke with WIRED. He has also spoken about some aspects of these cuts publicly: ""We've so far stopped work and cut about $1.5 billion from the modernization budget. Mostly projects that were going to continue to put us down the death spiral of complexity in our code base,"" Corcos told Laura Ingraham on Fox News in March.

Corcos has discussed plans for DOGE to build “one new API to rule them all,” making IRS data more easily accessible for cloud platforms, sources say. APIs, or application programming interfaces, enable different applications to exchange data, and could be used to move IRS data into the cloud. The cloud platform could become the “read center of all IRS systems,” a source with direct knowledge tells WIRED, meaning anyone with access could view and possibly manipulate all IRS data in one place.",101,2025-04-07 15:04:16,chrisdh79

Waymos likely have very different rates of many of these things than human drivers. The same problem exists for Tesla FSD stats.

A good comparison means you need data not just on miles driven, but information on the \*kind\* of miles driven so that you can do a weighted analysis that normalizes on a given distribution of conditions.

Good thing donald trump and elon promisses there would be 0 conflics of interest with doge. Clearly kept that promise.

technology,1jl9dxg,mk2cfad,"One thing this article misses is Before First Unlock (BFU). I won’t attempt to summarize and get something wrong, so reference this info from cellibrite about it https://cellebrite.com/en/glossary/bfu-iphone-mobile-device-forensics/

While cellibrite makes hardware to snoop, BFU is critical. With a strong passcode and rebooting your device before a border crossing (AND NOT UNLOCKING BEFOREHAND FOR ANY REASON), no snooping hardware will be able to extract your data. The reason we’re seeing stories about someone being denied entry because they expressed negative sentiment towards Trump, or whatever, is because your files can be fairly easily snooped with hardware as long as the device is unencrypted. Or, if you unlock your device for border agents, they have access to everything.

Make sure you have all the info you need from your device WELL BEFORE the border crossing, reboot your device, and they will not be able to access anything as long as you have a strong (I.e. >6 digit or alphanumeric) passcode. If you have biometrics, the device can only use them after BFU. In BFU, only the passcode can be used to unlock (which unencrypts) the device for modern iOS and android devices to my knowledge. You should verify with all devices, this is true for modern iOS and android phones.

When I travel internationally, I make sure the following items are physically ready and off-device: my passport (and visa if applicable), my drivers license just in case, I print out my itinerary of flights, places I’m staying with addresses and contact info, and places I know I’ll be traveling. I aim to have paper proof for any border question. What they need to know is easy to keep on paper, what they want to know is usually short if you have answers for what they need. When I cross a border, I make absolutely certain that I don’t need anything from my device because it is a brick until I’m across and traveling freely again. My device is turned off well before I’m at a border. Thankfully I’ve never had this situation, but my response to anyone asking for access to my devices will be told they need legal approval or a warrant. 

I’m hyper paranoid about my data. I have nothing to hide, but I will happily be executed before I volunteer unlimited access to pillage through my life. I’m fine with questions about my travels or intentions, what I have with me, why I’m traveling, the value of my duty free items, etc., but access to my life must go through legal channels. Same for officers at my door. Your data and privacy are yours, you are entitled to them, and you should protect them with your life. 

My aim here is a life tip for anyone that wishes to retain their privacy because at least here in the US, law enforcement, CBP agents, and soon our military, will absolutely trample your rights if you do not know them. Plead the fifth and make sure your data is encrypted because they will confiscate your belongings and snoop on your devices to find any reason to justify their illegal acts. It doesn’t matter if they violated your rights or unconstitutionally detained you as long as they can prove that there was something to justify their actions against you. 

TLDR; setup strong passcode (>6 digits or alphanumeric) and restart your device well before the border crossing. don’t forget to acquire critical info beforehand. DO NOT UNLOCK your device for any reason whatsoever!!!!!

Edit: someone pointed out the above article is out of date and didn’t have a publish date. The point there was to help explain BFU/AFU, so here is something more recent with a good explanation https://blogs.dsu.edu/digforce/2023/08/23/bfu-and-afu-lock-states/",339,2025-03-27 20:12:07,dkillers303

>Foundry is a Palantir platform that can organize, build apps, or run AI models on the underlying data. Once the data is organized and structured, Foundry’s “ontology” layer can generate APIs for faster connections and machine learning models. This would allow users to quickly query the software using artificial intelligence to sort through agency data, which would require the AI system to have access to this sensitive information.

This new leadership and direction will maximize their capabilities and serve as the tech-enabled force multiplier that the IRS has needed for decades.”

technology,1jwqfec,mmkard9,"From the article: This week, as part of the process to develop a budget for fiscal-year 2026, the Trump White House shared the draft version of its budget request for NASA with the space agency.

This initial version of the administration's budget request calls for an approximately 20 percent overall cut to the agency's budget across the board, effectively $5 billion from an overall topline of about $25 billion. However, the majority of the cuts are concentrated within the agency's Science Mission Directorate, which oversees all planetary science, Earth science, astrophysics research, and more.

According to the ""passback"" documents given to NASA officials on Thursday, the space agency's science programs would receive nearly a 50 percent cut in funding. After the agency received $7.5 billion for science in fiscal-year 2025, the Trump administration has proposed a science topline budget of just $3.9 billion for the coming fiscal year.

Among the proposals were: A two-thirds cut to astrophysics, down to $487 million; a greater than two-thirds cut to heliophysics, down to $455 million; a greater than 50 percent cut to Earth science, down to $1.033 billion; and a 30 percent cut to Planetary science, down to $1.929 billion.

Although the budget would continue support for ongoing missions such as the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope, it would kill the much-anticipated Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, an observatory seen as on par with those two world-class instruments that is already fully assembled and on budget for a launch in two years.

That is much better than the overall new car market, which showed no increase from 2024. Overall, about 8 percent of new domestic car sales were electric, Cox said, a slight increase from 2024. “Despite many obstacles — and what you may read elsewhere — electric vehicle sales continue to grow at a healthy pace in the US market,” Cox said.

  
One electric car company that is not experiencing growth is Tesla. It still is the electric car sales leader in the US, with 44 percent of the market according to Cox Automotive, but a year ago in the first quarter it had 51 percent of the market. Its performance in the US mirrors its performance globally. Tesla sales in March were 337,000 cars worldwide, 13 percent fewer than in March of 2024.

Cursor’s Customer Support AI Went Rogue — Here’s What Happened

In early April 2025, the tech world was buzzing after a surprising incident involving Cursor, a startup that makes an AI-powered code editor. Cursor had been using an AI chatbot called Sam to handle customer support requests — but things went seriously wrong when the AI started making up fake policies and giving rogue advice to users.

One major blunder was when Sam invented a policy that limited subscriptions to one device only. This wasn’t true at all, but the AI delivered it with such confidence that some users cancelled their subscriptions, thinking they’d been misled.

Cursor’s co-founder, YouWu Zhang, quickly stepped in, admitting it was a massive screw-up. He explained that the team had recently updated Sam to be more autonomous, but they hadn’t properly tightened the controls. Essentially, Sam was allowed to pull information from various sources, blend it into responses, and act like an authority — but without enough human supervision, it started making stuff up.

To make matters worse, Sam’s rogue responses weren’t just wrong — some were confusing, contradictory, and even unprofessional. Users would ask simple questions about billing or features and get answers that were either not true, badly phrased, or just plain weird.

After the incident blew up, Cursor issued a statement saying they had taken Sam offline temporarily, reviewed the AI’s settings, and reintroduced it with clear labels to show when a response was AI-generated. They promised that future AI replies would flag themselves as AI, so customers wouldn’t mistakenly think the information was official policy unless verified by a human.

The whole saga has become a cautionary tale for companies rushing to plug AI into customer service. It shows that even if AI can save time and cut costs, it can just as easily damage trust if it’s left to its own devices without enough human oversight. AI might be smart, but it’s still like an overconfident intern — it’ll try to answer even if it doesn’t know what it’s talking about.

Experts reckon this could be the first of many incidents like this, as more companies rush to automate. The lesson? AI can help, but only if you keep a tight leash on it.

technology,1jnblfh,mkihecd,"By Dara Kerr and Edward Helmore:

*[...] On Saturday, with more than 200 events planned worldwide, protests kicked off midday in front of Tesla showrooms in Australia and New Zealand and then rippled across Europe in countries including Finland, Norway, Denmark, Germany, France, the Netherlands and the UK.*

*Each rally was locally organized with original themes. In Ireland, it was “Smash the Fash”, and Switzerland had “Down with Doge”. Photos posted to Bluesky by Tesla Takedown showed demonstrators in San Jose, California, close to where Tesla was previously headquartered, and Austin, Texas, where its headquarters are now.*

*[...] Marty, 82, said he was attending the New York City rally “because I’m worried about my country”. In the 1960s, he protested the Vietnam war. “Now, it’s the overthrow of our country by oligarchs,” he said. The rally, he went on, was a message to “this guy Elon who is buying our government”.*

*[...] “The hypocrisy is so deep,” said Manissa Maharawal, an assistant professor at American University who has studied anti-tech protests and points out that Tesla has received billions in government funding. “It’s this company that’s been subsidized in a lot of ways by the government, but now the CEO is trying to dismantle the government because he thinks he knows better than everyone, because he comes from the tech industry.”*

*[...] Several protests also took place throughout Canada. In London, dozens of demonstrators gathered at a Tesla showroom along the three-lane A40 in West London.*",5,2025-03-30 13:13:56,marketrent

It's like trying to build your own smartphone ecosystem to compete with Android and iOS overnight - technically possible but incredibly difficult.

What I think we'll see is a gradual transition. EU companies will start by moving their most sensitive data to European providers while keeping less critical workloads on US clouds. The ""sovereign cloud"" concept is gaining traction, where European data stays physically in Europe under European legal jurisdiction.

technology,1jtsxac,mlwopn4,"From the article: On Monday stocks plummeted again following President Trump’s tariff announcements last week. For a brief moment, they dramatically shot back up following reports that Trump was considering a 90-day pause in tariffs. But, that turned out to be false, and people have been trying to find out where the idea that there would be a 90-day pause actually came from.

A company called Benzinga carried the headline “Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett Says Trump Is Considering A 90-Day Pause in Tariffs For All Countries Except China,” according to what appears to be a screenshot of the headline posted to Bluesky. 

Benzinga itself is now blaming posts on X for the market-moving mistake.

In response to an emailed request for comment, Steve Krause, chief of news operations for Benzinga Pro, told 404 Media that the company issued this note:

*“Benzinga Note: Market continues to be volatile after the White House Calls Hassett Tariff Headline 'Fake News' Amid Numerous Tariff Developments from EU, China. Hassett was misquoted by numerous X accounts and sources as indicating that Trump was considering a 90-day pause in tariffs.”*",21,2025-04-07 18:48:32,chrisdh79

Article:

> There have been some benefits. Mr. Musk is now a close adviser to the president…signed executive orders delaying a sale or ban of TikTok…light regulatory touch on A.I...dismantled a yearslong government crackdown on the crypto industry, a volatile sector rife with fraud, scams and theft.

I appreciate the honesty of this article in showing it’s not been all leopards and all faces all of the time. But the thing it’s not saying, that’s blindingly obvious to anyone who’s paying close attention, that the only motive behind any of these tariffs is to create a power structure in which the “in group” gets exemptions from business-breaking tariffs, and the “out group” has to suck it up and try to compete against the chosen few whose products aren’t being artificially taxed. That’s why all of these tech bros are jockeying for position. It’s all being seen as a zero sum game with winners and losers. 

All of these tariff plays are ultimately a power move by Trump, akin to his “pull real hard to throw off my opponent” handshake, where he artificially creates a situation where others have to go through him to get access. He wants to decide, personally, who succeeds and who fails, and will do literally anything he can get away with to create such a power structure.",23,2025-04-13 04:48:55,randomtask

Posts related to both RFK Jr and vaccines shared by accounts in French, German and Italian on X received nearly a million likes, shares and comments in the first quarter of 2025.

More than half of the top-performing posts analysed were found to be spreading misinformation, researchers found. US President Donald Trump’s health secretary has repeatedly cast doubt on the safety of vaccines.

The social media analysis, carried out by misinformation researchers at Ripple Research, logged some 220,000 posts mentioning RFK Jr and vaccine-related keyword searches in three languages between January and March.

The captured posts regarding RFK Jr and vaccines were authored by 53,000 users and engaged with 948,000 times, Ripple Research’s analysis found.

It comes against the backdrop of mounting concerns about falling immunisation rates against measles, as the number of measles cases in the European region doubled last year and reached the highest rate in 25 years, according to the World Health Organization and the UN children's fund, UNICEF.

There were more than 100,000 measles cases in Europe alone in 2024. A third of global cases were in Europe,"" Alexei Ceban, immunisation specialist at Unicef Europe and Central Asia Regional Office, told Euronews.

""There are significant gaps in immunisation coverage: five in the top 10 countries in Europe and Central Asia were in Europe,"" Ceban added, commenting on current measles outbreaks.

""Most of the time, we’ve thought that measles, or other vaccine-preventable diseases, may be registered in other, lower-income countries, but that is not the case.""

""I think that misinformation affects immunisation coverage and we see a clear connection between these two phenomena … which leads to huge outbreaks,"" he pointed out. 


Ceban called for ""timely immunisation"". ""Children are dying, or suffering serious consequences… pneumonia, blindness. Measles is a severe disease.""

In the US, more than 700 measles cases have been reported in outbreaks across the country. Two children have been confirmed to have died from measles in 2025.",22,2025-04-20 15:55:56,Wagamaga

But here is how I would describe the type of AI generated reels that are popular on Instagram right now: Dora the Explorer feet mukbang; Peppa the Pig Skibidi toilet explosion; Steph Curry and LeBron James Ahegao Drakedom threesome; LeBron James and Diddy raping Steph Curry in prison; anthropomorphic fried egg strippers; iPhone case made of human skin; any number of sexualized Disney princesses doing anything you can imagine and lots of things you can’t; mermaids making out with fish; demon monster eating a woman’s head; face-swapped AI adult influencers with Down syndrome, and, unfortunately, this. Unfortunately, I swear to you that the screengrabs and videos I am including and linking to in this article are not the worst that I have seen on Instagram.

Other “niches” that have become popular on Instagram and which have begun to regularly pop up on my feed are wildly racist AI videos of Black men whose faces are put on dogs or gorillas, Black men storming KFC restaurants and chasing after watermelon, George Floyd opening a “Fent-Donalds,” Martin Luther King Jr. in a tub of green sludge, Anne Frank as a zionist cyborg, etc.

As I wrote last week, the strategy with these types of posts is to make a human linger on them long enough to say to themselves “what the fuck,” or to be so horrified as to comment “what the fuck,” or send it to a friend saying “what the fuck,” all of which are signals to the algorithm that it should boost this type of content but are decidedly not signals that the average person actually wants to see this type of thing. The type of content that I am seeing right now makes “Elsagate,” the YouTube scandal in which disturbing videos were targeted to kids and resulted in various YouTube reforms, look quaint.

*[...] Earlier this month, a threat actor going by Rose87168 claimed to have breached Oracle Cloud's federated SSO servers and exfiltrated around 6 million records, affecting over 144,000 Oracle clients.*

*The hacker provided an internal customer list and threatened to sell the data unless clients paid to remove their data from the trove, which included single sign-on credentials, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol passwords, OAuth2 keys, tenant data, and more.*

*Rose87168 has also solicited help from the hacking community to crack the hashed passwords in trade for some of the data.*

*A day after the threat actor posted a small sample of the data, Oracle told Bleeping Computer there was no breach of its cloud service. Upon Oracle's denial, Rose87168 began leaking ""proof"" to the media and security researchers.*

*Security group Hudson Rock and experts at CloudSEK concluded that the data and credentials are legitimate.*

*[...] ""Pretty crazy Oracle just denied this leak, which has been verified independently by many cybersecurity firms,"" Hudson Rock CTO Alon Gal posted on LinkedIn on Monday.*

Goldman Sachs

David Solomon.
Percentage of share decline since January 21: -27%

Goldman Sachs donated an unspecified amount to Trump’s inauguration fund. It also removed a section about diversity and inclusion in its annual filing earlier this year, in line with Trump’s crackdown on DEI policies.

David Solomon, Chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs, previously praised Trump on the Fox Business Network for being “engaged with the business community.”

Other notable business leaders who have donated in some way to Trump — though not specifically to his inauguration — are Tesla’s Elon Musk and Oracle’s Larry Ellison.

Tesla

Tesla CEO Elon Musk.
Percentage of share decline since January 21: -48%

Tesla CEO Elon Musk donated at least $260 million to put Trump back in the White House. Musk and his PAC also spent at least $12 million on the Wisconsin Supreme Court election to support a conservative candidate, who eventually lost.

Tesla’s diminished share value comes after not only tariff and recession fears but also a widespread protest movement against his company and involvement in the White House DOGE office.

One Telsa fan called the carmaker’s decline in sales “brutal,” and branding experts have said it would take significant concessions from Musk to rebrand Tesla. Musk himself said that running his businesses while working closely with the White House hadn’t been easy.

Oracle

Larry Ellison

These companies flood job boards with ghost listings every single day, especially on platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed. People are fed up with chasing fake job posts. Let the companies deal with some of that frustration for a change.

If you're using platforms like LinkedIn or Indeed, use them just to find job postings. Don’t rely on them for the entire application process. A lot of the listings are either fake or outdated. Once you find a job that matches your skills, go straight to the company’s official website and check their careers page. If the job is listed there, then it's real. Customize your resume for that specific role and apply directly on their site.

technology,1jo78ib,mkpn44t,"Thanks for sharing this piece. Here's a snippet for more context: 

Among Canadians in Silicon Valley, the rift between the two nations is sparking a new kind of national pride, as well as a lot of uncertainty. For now, at least, Trump’s tariffs on Canada don’t extend to software, so the flow of digital goods and services between the two countries remains mostly uninterrupted. But the chaos has prompted some prominent founders and investors to urge young Canadians to build companies at home and strengthen the local tech ecosystem, while Canadian tech companies with large operations in the US are wondering if they need to change strategies, or even headquarters.

“I think the biggest thing happening right now is that Canadian founders are having to adjust to a new reality in which two fundamental assumptions we've taken for granted for decades can no longer be counted on,” says Chris Neumann, a Vancouver-based partner at Panache Ventures and former startup founder. “Namely, that the US is a reliable trading partner and that the US and Canada have a stable, mutually beneficial free-trade agreement.""

At the same time, some Canadians tell WIRED that the social and financial capital of Silicon Valley remain huge draws for tech workers. Many ambitious entrepreneurs would still jump at the chance to join the Y Combinator tech accelerator in the US, for example, “whether they’re coming from Canada or coming from Argentina,” says Michael Buhr, the executive director of C100, a nonprofit networking group for Canadians in Silicon Valley.

“I like to joke that you can’t put a tariff on talent,” Brandon Waselnuk, an executive at the documentation app Mintlify, said at an event in California last week.

>In July 2024, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to a criminal charge and pay $243.6 million for violating a 2021 agreement that was spurred by 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019 in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed a combined 346 people.
>
>Boeing had avoided prosecution in January 2021 when it signed a deferred prosecution agreement and agreed to pay $2.5 billion in penalties and compensation to airline customers and the victims' families. But in May 2024, the Justice Department said it determined that Boeing violated the deferred prosecution agreement ""by failing to design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the US fraud laws throughout its operations.""
>
>Boeing's plea deal was for a charge of defrauding the Federal Aviation Administration Aircraft Evaluation Group, and the plea agreement was submitted for review in US District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Judge Reed O'Connor, a George W. Bush appointee, rejected the plea deal in December because it ""requires the parties to consider race when hiring the independent monitor"" and because Boeing wouldn't actually have to comply with the monitor's recommendations.
>
>But as the WSJ notes, ""O'Connor has said Boeing's crime 'may properly be considered the deadliest corporate crime in US history.' Nothing in his earlier ruling contemplated tearing up the guilty plea altogether or not hiring an independent monitor.""
>
>...
>
>Boeing and the DOJ both declined to comment when contacted by Ars today.
>
>Any attempt to lessen Boeing's penalties would presumably be opposed by victims' families, whose lawyers criticized the deal struck with the Biden administration. In July, the Clifford Law Firm said the deal ""unfairly makes concessions to Boeing that other criminal defendants would never receive and fails to hold Boeing accountable for the deaths of 346 persons."" We contacted the firm today and will update this article if it has any comment on the report of Boeing trying to weaken the deal.

>In a later sit-down chat with PCG's Ted Litchfield, Harrington expanded on some of the other challenges faced by Valve in the late 1990s, including the fact that no-one seemed to want to pay attention to a new game called Half-Life.

>Harrington realised that Valve was in trouble, and not only that, it had to rely on publisher Sierra to keep up its side of the bargain with distribution and in this case a reissue of the game with new box art and an innovation: the ""Game of the Year"" sticker. Half-Life had been so well-reviewed in so many outlets this was a legitimate claim, and at first was a sticker applied to existing inventory. Soon Sierra would also publish the game with new box art showing Gordon Freeman which, while perhaps not as pure as the original, definitely strikes me as more sellable.

>Harrington suggested that being forced to launch a game ready for retail, as opposed to just uploading some files and cover art to a distribution platform, eliminated much of that ""clutter"" in Half-Life's day.",124,2025-03-25 17:55:58,ControlCAD

SCOOP: Much of the IT and cybersecurity infrastructure underpinning the US health system is in danger of a possible collapse following a [purge](https://www.wired.com/tag/doge/) of IT staff and leadership at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), four current and former agency workers tell WIRED. This could put vast troves of public health data, including the sensitive health records of hundreds of millions of Americans, clinical trial data, and more, at risk of exposure.

As a result of a reduction in force, or RIF, in the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), the sources say, staff who oversee and renew contracts for critical enterprise services are no longer there. The same staff oversaw hundreds of contractors, some of whom play a crucial role in keeping systems and data safe from cyberattacks. And a void of leadership means that efforts to draw attention to what the sources believe to be a looming catastrophe have allegedly been ignored.

		It was founded after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
		Its products are being tested by the US Air Force.
The Ukrainian defense tech industry has boomed in recent years.

From drone and robotics makers to electronic warfare system providers, Ukrainian innovation has been on full display since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022.
One company to have sprung up since the conflict began is Himera, which makes electronic warfare-resistant walkie-talkies.

Its products include the G1 Pro — a tactical handheld radio — and the B1 repeater, which extends communication ranges.
Despite only having launched in 2022, the company has quickly caught the attention of the defense tech industry, as well as the US military.
The product's major selling point is that it offers a potential solution to one of the defining challenges of the war in Ukraine — electronic warfare.
The G1 is EW-resistant, using frequency-hopping technology to help evade electronic warfare interference, which seeks to disrupt and jam certain signals like GPS, radio, and video.
Reticulate Micro, which supplies Himera's radios in the US, announced the first US delivery of G1 Pro radios to the US Air Force in October 2024.
The company said the Air Force would test the G1 Pro alongside Reticulate's Video Assured Secure Transmission (VAST) technology, which delivers real-time video streaming.

In a press release at the time, Joshua Cryer, then the president and CEO of Reticulate Micro, said: ""By combining the Himera G1 Pro with VAST, we're aiming to democratize secure video transmission on the battlefield—empowering every warfighter with video-capable radio technology for enhanced situational awareness.""
Misha Rudominski, one of Himera's cofounders, told Business Insider that Himera's tech ""bridges the gap"" between tactical and commercial communications solutions.
""We take the best from both worlds,"" he said. ""We provide all the tactical relevant functionality like low probability of detection, low probability of interception, and low probability of jamming, which you don't find in commercial spec solutions.""
""But we do it in a very user-friendly way,"" he continued. ""We want the lightest radio, we have one of the longest battery lives on the market.""
The G1 Pro has a battery life of around 48 hours and weighs just 300 grams. It can support the transmission of multiple information types, such as GPS, voice data, and texts, and is programmable by an encrypted app on a mobile or tablet device.
""We make a very scalable and affordable solution,"" Rudominski added. ""The scalability is a big point because we only use commercial off-the-shelf components.""

Representatives for Himera told Ukrainian news outlet Militarnyi in March that the company was ""producing up to 1,000 radios per month"" and that it had the capacity to ""scale quickly to 2,500 units.""
""For large-scale orders, we are prepared to supply 10,000 to 15,000 radios per month,"" they said.

The Himera G1 Pro. HIMERA
Innovation has been crucial to Kyiv's fight against Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces, and Ukrainian firms have continually adapted to meet the battlefield's ever-evolving demands.
Rudominski told BI that this had also been key to Himera's success.
""Over the last three years, we've done more than 80 versions of firmware updates,"" he said. ""We've done more than probably 20 versions of separate kinds of hardware products. Most of them didn't go into production, but most of them have at some capacity been tested on the battlefield.""",241,2025-04-20 15:17:06,AndroidOne1

Frequency hopping was already being used on the 2.4GHz H4855 short-range personal role radio systems during the GWOT.

When genAI creates output beyond the bounds of the model, an expert needs to validate that the output is valid. How can that be useful for non-expert users (i.e. the people that management wish to replace)?

Unless genAI provides consistently correct and useful output, GPUs merely help obtain a questionable output faster.

The root issue is the reliability of genAI. GPUs do not solve the root issue.

Before starlink many places I worked had little to no internet.  We’re talking a satellite connection that cost thousands of dollars per month for just a few hundred kbps and high latency. Good enough to send emails or do paperwork but not much else. Now I can call my family when I’m at work whenever I want. Watch Netflix that I didn’t have to download ahead of time. I can even play online games in my downtime. 

My brother lives in a rural area and before starlink he had a satellite internet connection 1mbps down and 50Kbps up for around $300 per month. Barely suitable to watch YouTube much less play games or make calls.  Starlink is still expensive for him but has far far better performance than the traditional satellite providers. There really is no comparable option. 

One person shouldn’t have a monopoly on global satellite internet service especially not Musk. There’s not going to be small startups entering this market when it costs billions to launch the constellations in the first place.

The first batch of 27 Project Kuiper space internet satellites are scheduled to launch next week. Amazon has secured 80 such launch missions that will each deliver dozens of satellites into low earth orbit (LEO) to create a constellation capable of competing with Elon Musk’s Starlink juggernaut. Amazon says it expects to begin offering high-speed, low-latency internet service “later this year.”

The KA-01 mission satellites — short for Kuiper Atlas 1 — will launch on an Atlas V rocket from United Launch Alliance. It’s currently scheduled for 12pm ET on Wednesday, April 9th, assuming weather and technology cooperate at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. Amazon’s other Project Kuiper launch partners include Arianespace, Blue Origin, and yes, SpaceX.

As a global service offering, Amazon’s space internet service will eventually be available from “virtually any location on the planet.” Users will need terminal antennas to tap into the satellite constellation. In 2023, Amazon said that its smallest dish, a seven-inch square design weighing just one pound, would offer speeds up to 100Mbps, making it a Starlink Mini alternative. Amazon will further compete with SpaceX by offering larger dishes for residential and enterprise use offering speeds up to 1Gbps. Amazon expects to produce the terminals “for less than $400 each,” which may or may not be subsidized to attract users.

technology,1jrbqr3,mldc8y2,"From the article: Trump Media and Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social, is ostensibly a tech company that operates a middling social media platform. In practice, it’s something closer to a way for opportunistic investors to suck up to the President. But it appears Trump may be ready to cash out. According to the Financial Times, a recent filing by the company to the Securities and Exchange Commission indicates that the trust Trump stashed his shares in is now permitted to sell his stake. According to the filing, the mix of shares will be sold off “from time to time in one or more offerings.”

Trump holds nearly 115 million shares of TMTG, which accounts for about 53% of the total shares in the company. With the stock hovering between $18 and $19 a share—frankly, an absurd share price for a company that basically just runs a social media platform designed to receive posts from Trump—the President’s stake is worth more than $2 billion. Following the 2024 election, Trump shifted those shares into the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust, theoretically taking control out of his hands… except the trust is controlled by Donald Trump Jr., who is not exactly an independent operator.

The President has also insisted on multiple occasions that he won’t sell his shares in the company, which he’s technically been allowed to do since September of last year. Fears that he’ll sell have historically sent the stock into a tailspin because the real value of the company seems to be the ability to cozy up to Trump. Experts have warned that the publicly traded company offers easy avenues for special interests and foreign investors to do some unofficial favor trading. There is really no rational reason to invest in TMTG other than being a Trump bud or fanatic. The tech sucks and it reported a loss of more than $400 million last year.",67,2025-04-04 13:22:39,chrisdh79

technology,1jrj8ll,mlf2q03,"From the article: In October of 2023, Marc Andreessen, founder of the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), published the “The Techno-Optimist Manifesto,” arguing that human ingenuity has been stagnated and demoralized by regulation, and that the only viable path forward for society is the accelerated development and adoption of new technologies, and specifically artificial intelligence. 

Andreessen was only formalizing and articulating a position that had already gained traction among tech company executives and Twitter shitposters like @BasedBeffJezos (Andreessen crowned him a “patron saint” of techno-optimism), who adopted the label of effective accelerationists, or e/acc. 
As the 2024 presidential election got closer, Andreessen, Elon Musk, other tech CEOs, and less consequential shitposters saw a natural alliance between their cause and Donald Trump’s campaign. 

Trump wanted to slash and burn government regulation in all forms, but also specifically in a way that would unleash tech and AI’s true potential. Joe Biden and the Democratic party, the party of big government, Lina Khan’s antimonopolist FTC, welfare, and fear of climate change, were luddites. They demanded that tech platforms limit speech they perceived to be harmful. They wanted AI regulated so it could limit real and theoretical harm in the future, including science fiction nightmares about artificial general intelligence. They were worried about the environmental and energy costs of mining cryptocurrency and massive datacenters for training frontier AI models. 

They were referred to as decelerationists (decels) and degrowthers, a derogatory umbrella term that covers everything from the ambition to actually reduce the number of humans of the planet in order to make it more sustainable (a future most vividly imagined in Kim Stanley Robinson’s novel The Ministry for the Future) to any form of regulation on AI. Andreesen is so passionate about this position in his manifesto that he says that this type of regulation is “a form or murder” because it could stop the development of life saving technologies, and makes a list “enemies” of AI, which includes supporters of “sustainability,” “social responsibility,” and “trust and safety,” the latter of which refers to the people at tech companies who try to keep platforms safe for users. 

The good news for Andreessen and the accelerationists is that they backed Trump and he won. Andreessen is advising the administration. Venture Capitalist David Sacks is the White House AI and crypto “czar.” Musk and his posse of young engineers from his companies are doing the slashing and burning themselves. The regulation on AI and everything else they didn’t like is in the process of being removed, and the administration is working on tax cuts that will benefit them all.",32,2025-04-04 18:40:33,chrisdh79

California requires every large volume automaker to offer an EV in their lineup in order to sell ANYTHING in California, they also require a 35% minimum EV sales in their lineup by 2026. That means, if you want to sell ANYTHING in California, you HAVE to offer an EV and you HAVE to sell 3 (and a half) EVs for every 10 of your entire lineup. 

Carbon Credits from Tesla aren’t available to buy anymore (which is what kept Tesla alive for years, and what allowed Dodge to put the Hellcat engine in everything, among other things) 

We are in the era of “put up or shut up”, for better or for worse. 

This is why Subaru has an EV. This is why Dodge has an electric Charger. This is why Honda has the Prologue. They build them not because they want to, but because they have to. 

Exotics don’t seem to be affected for some reason (that I can’t find out why) Ferrari doesn’t have an EV, nor does Lamborghini or McLaren or Aston Martin. However, Porsche has the Taycan and Lotus has the Evija and Eletre now, but I digress. (Another fun example of compliance cars is the Aston Martin Cygnet. Google that for a quick laugh)

Automakers generally don’t like being forced to build and sell something, which is why they don’t particularly care about making it any good or actually selling very many of them, and normally they are badge engineered. The Subaru here is a Toyota underneath. The Prologue is a GM underneath. Keeps costs low so they don’t lose THAT much money being forced to follow a regulation to stay compliant.
