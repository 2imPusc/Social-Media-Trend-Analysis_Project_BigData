She was the main protagonist of the documentary, from French-Iranian director Sepideh Farsi. It was accepted into Cannes' ACID section earlier this week, which runs parallel to the main festival.

ACID is an association of film directors which, since 1992, has been promoting the cinema distribution of independent films and encouraging debates between authors and audiences. The strength of the solidarity chain it has built lies on its founding principle: the support given by filmmakers to other filmmakers, French or international.

> Fatima  had gained international recognition for her photojournalism capturing the impact on the Gaza Strip’s civilian population of the Israeli military campaign.

> The documentary revolves around video conversations between Farsi and Hassouna. They began when the director connected with the young woman while researching a wider documentary on the events unfolding in Gaza.

> “She was such a light, so talented. When you see the film you’ll understand,” Farsi told Deadline. “I had talked to her a few hours before to tell her that the film was in Cannes and to invite her.”

> Farsi recounts that Hassouna was open to the idea of attending the screening, as long as she could return to Gaza afterwards.",1,2025-04-17 19:44:52,BunyipPouch

movies,1jnasrw,mki78r1,"Details:

>The Google-owned video-hosting giant has turned off ad revenue on Screen Culture and KH Studio trailers after a Deadline investigation chronicled the scale and sophistication of their output.

>Deadline analyzed how Screen Culture is creating trailers that closely immitate official marketing material for franchises like The Fantastic Four: First Steps and Superman, but splices in AI imagery to tease irresistible details about a movie that appeal to their giant fandoms.

>KH Studio, meanwhile, imagines outlandish versions of major films and series, including a James Bond movie starring Henry Cavill and Margot Robbie, and a Squid Game season with Leonardo DiCaprio.

>Our deep dive revealed that instead of protecting copyright on these videos, a handful of Hollywood studios, including Warner Bros. Discovery and Sony, are secretly asking YouTube to ensure that the ad revenue from the AI-heavy videos flows in their direction. The studios declined to comment.

>YouTube’s monetization policies state that if creators are borrowing material from others, “you need to change it significantly to make it your own.” It adds that vidoes must not be “duplicative or repetitive” and should not be made for the “sole purpose of getting views.”

>Furthermore, YouTube misinformation policies prohibit content that has been technically manipulated or doctored in a way that misleads viewers.",3335,2025-03-30 11:57:23,MarvelsGrantMan136
movies,1jnasrw,mkisfsr,"The ""never intended to mislead"" defense is monumentally absurd.

* The titles of these fake trailers often use the language ""Official Trailer"".
* Their releases are often timed to drop just before a real trailer for that movie is expected.
* They use studio logos AND watermarks. 
* Their titles reflect fake theatrical release dates. 
* When they finally started using the term ""concept trailer"" in the descriptions, after a decade plus of not doing that or only doing it in the channel bio, they all did it at the same time, implying their hands were forced by a legal issue or TOS change.
* Their viewership multiplied in recent years because Youtube removed the ability to see how many downvotes videos are getting, which was previously the way to identify something was off without watching a minute or so. Before this, the downvotes often outnumbered the upvotes, but that didn't slow their being suggested in feeds.
* With generative AI now in play, they've also been pumping them out at a much faster rate with minimal work to do so.
* When the trailer is for a movie that doesn't exist at all, it dominates Google feed suggestions, and a top trending Google search term for that day is ""When is (movie) coming to streaming"" and ""Is (movie) real?"". Google owns Youtube, so people are essentially swirling within their ecosystem with this bait.
* As several entertainment publications devolve into clickbait, many write daily articles of ""Everything you need to know about that new (movie) trailer"", which are paragraphs of padded out blog slop that finally conclude with ""Actually, this isn't real, but it shows there is very strong interest in a real one.""
* It has gotten worse every year in magnitudes creators could not possibly be unaware of.
* And the idea that everyone knew they were fake is just a lie. Yes, someone in this sub is likely to identify a fake, but most aren't engaged enough in cinema to understand, as evidenced by the comment sections.


I'm happy to hear they've demonetized these channels, but they'll probably remonetize them after a few minor tweaks to the strategy.

movies,1k3iybx,mo3y5o2,"I think the recent Zoomer turn away from anything even moderately sexualized kind of goes too far into conservativism or shaming. There are times men and women can be sexy and times they can not be sexy. The idea a sex scene is somehow a shameful choice by a director regardless of context to me seems like a very limited view.

I can see a muslim woman choosing to wear a hijab as a means of controlling the way that men are able to see her and I can see that as empowering for her. I can also see a woman choosing to wear provocative clothes as empowering and the sweat pants too if the context serves so acting like there is only one means of attainting empowerment through sex is I think where we fall apart in a lot of ways. If the story is told well without falling into the realms of forcing it's message that's all that matters.

The more interesting conversation I'd say is that women are able to tell stories of sex based identity and empowerment yet men aren't (at least within the heterosexual viewpoint). That's something I'd like to drill down into more. Sex is a great topic to depict in film for these reasons and every angle of every sex has value if you tell the story right.

Novocaine, Fly Me to the Moon, and The Amateur have been pretty ""meh"" rated all around. Horizon was mostly negative. Red One, The Alto Knights, and Megalopolis are almost universally considered fucking abominations.

We've basically seen what caused the death of arcades, the home experience has caught up to the theater experience, at least enough to where going to the theater isn't worth it most of the time.  

At the theater, I have to deal with people on their phones, talking, babies, people crunching, etc. I can't pause to take a piss or a refill, the seats, while better, are still weirdly uncomfortable, the audio is sometimes insane and I can't put on subtitles.  

At home, I get a good enough sized screen and the sound quality is good enough.  Is it as a good as a theater? No, but it's also not a 20-30 inch CRT at 240p with 2 tinny speakers.  

Also fuck ads.  Every time I go to the theater before we even get previews we get 5-10 minutes of straight ads after spending $15-30 on a ticket.  Fuck that.

Similar to the console to arcade analogy, you'll never replace a full scale Daytona or After Burner cabinet, but that's a unique experience.

He took a significant break after *The Revenant* (2015). He didn’t appear in any films in 2016, 2017, or 2018.
Finally, from 2019-2025 he appeared (or will appear) in four films in six years, or an average of one film every 1.5 years.

They cite a clip from 2016, way before generative AI even existed, in which hayao miyazaki calls an AI animation an affront to life, but he's not talking about the same thing people are mad about now, though he obviously wouldn't like generative AI either. 

He was shown a clip of a program that showed an AI taking the model of a human with data about it's limb structure, range of motion, and other variables, that the AI then took and tried to learn to ""walk."" As an example of what it was doing, imagine programming basic gravity, velocity, and bounce physics into an AI that ""shoots"" a ball from one side of the screen at a certain angle and velocity with the intention of making it into a ""hoop"" on the other side, then brute forcing a million different angles and speeds to shoot the ball to find which ones would succeed. 

The program they showed miyazaki was doing that with the goal of making a human 3d model go from point a to point b. What the engineers found was that the computer came up with a lot of ways that humans could move if they didnt feel pain. Stuff like grabbing and pulling along the ground with only the head, or weird forms of slithering. They told miyazaki that the computer came up with various forms of locomotion that humans wouldnt think of because pain or exertion wasnt a factor, and miyazaki basically said, ""oh, the computer doesnt feel pain? Well i have a friend who cant feel pain, why are you mocking him? This program mocking my friend who is a real person is, thus, an afront to life.""

These articles are taking the clip wildly out of context here, simply because it contained ""ghibli,"" ""hayao miyazaki,"" and ""AI.""

And if you can’t, then it’s fine too. Everyone isn’t meant to be some creative genius and the idea that Generative AI is going to make you seem talented is a farce. You’re doing nothing but typing in a prompt and having it feed back data that it’s taken from other’s works.

> Here's (not) Johnny! Recently located in the files of the Getty Images Hulton Archive, a significant piece of cinema history scanned from the original glass plate negative. Here, Alasdair Spark, a retired academic at the University of Winchester, details his investigation and shining discovery - swipe to see the vintage indexing material referenced, all still cared for in the files: ⁠
⁠
>> ""At last, it has been found. Following the earlier identification by facial recognition software of the unknown man in the photograph at the end of 'The Shining' as Santos Casani, a London ballroom dancer, I can reveal that the photo was one of three taken by the Topical Press Agency at a St Valentines Day Ball, 14 February 1921, at the Empress Rooms, the Royal Palace Hotel, Kensington. ⁠

>> ""I, Aric Toler from the NYT and others (thank you Reddit) had trawled newspaper archives trying to find matching photos of the venue or the people in it, many hours of hard brute force effort, all without success. It was starting to seem impossible, every cross-reference to Casani failed to match. Other likely places that were suggested didn’t match. There were some places we could not find images for and we started to fear that meant the photo might be lost to history, and never be found. ⁠

>> ""The photo (and others) was found following my contact with Murray Close (the official set photographer, who took the image of Jack Nicholson used in the version seen on screen), who recalled that the original had been sourced from the BBC Hulton Library. This reinforced a remark by Joan Smith, who did the retouching work – she had said in interviews that it came from the Warner Bros photo archive, which proves never to have existed. However, she also said in passing, and often unreported, that it might have come from the BBC Hulton Library. ⁠

>> ""I asked Getty Images, now the holders of the Hulton Archive to check for anything licensed to Stanley Kubrick’s company Hawk Films – Matt Butson, the VP Archives there, found one photo, dating from 1929 and bizarrely also showing Santos Casani, but it was not the photo at the end of the film. ⁠

movies,1k2es6n,mntljuv,"As long as they try to keep the film low-budget with practical effect and don't go too CGI heavy, as well as having a well-written script like the original, I am all for it. The original Tremors film is one of the most fun 80s comedy/sci-fi films (some might consider it a horror, but it's not really that scary). Seeing Kevin Bacon back in that role would be great if in the right hands. The last couple of direct to DVD Tremor films have been an indicator on how lazy the franchise can get. 


Although I do respect Michael Gross, who has reprised his role as Burt Gummer in all Tremor sequels. Including a 13 episode television series in 2003. He even played the great grandfather to the character in an origin prequel story. So he'll definitely be back. Hope he gets a good script this time.

The baby slept through it but idc.

Such a fantastic film and I will remember it in my old age as the film that saved cinema.

Must have been incredibly hard for the production to include Val like this. Perhaps quite tastefully, I haven't seen any 'making of' videos where raw footage, audio and voice manipulation was used for Icemans voice and appearance. To echo Maverick, 'this is a nice moment, let's not ruin it'.

I did read semi recently that Kilmer had a desire to continue acting but unfortunately life can be cruel.

movies,1jpc2lm,mky9jsj,"Deadline is reporting the news is real with Fincher set to direct the sequel at Netflix. Leonardo DiCaprio is not expected to return:

>Brad Pitt indeed got Tarantino’s blessing to show Pitt’s *Se7en* director David Fincher the script that focuses on subsequent adventures of *Once Upon A Time…In Hollywood*‘s Cliff Booth character. And because Fincher is exclusive to Netflix, the movie — if it gets made — will be financed and released by Netflix, straight to streaming. Tarantino will be paid a fortune for his words, as he readies a play he’s written and works on the final film he’ll direct. That one seems headed for Sony, where Tarantino directed the first film. No way Tarantino would helm his final film for a streaming service, but he respects Fincher and Netflix has been Fincher’s domain since he helped establish the streaming giant with *House of Cards.*

EDIT: [THR](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/quentin-tarantino-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-brad-pitt-1236178785/) just reported it too, it's definitely real",902,2025-04-02 01:00:35,MarvelsGrantMan136

>HIM stars former college wide-receiver Tyriq Withers (Atlanta, the upcoming I Know What You Did Last Summer) as Cameron Cade, a rising-star quarterback who has devoted his life, and identity, to football. On the eve of professional football’s annual scouting Combine, Cam is attacked by an unhinged fan and suffers a potentially career-ending brain trauma. 
 
>Just when all seems lost, Cam receives a lifeline when his hero, Isaiah White (Marlon Wayans), a legendary eight-time Championship quarterback and cultural megastar, offers to train Cam at Isaiah’s isolated compound that he shares with his celebrity influencer wife, Elsie White (Julia Fox; Uncut Gems, No Sudden Move). But as Cam’s training accelerates, Isaiah’s charisma begins to curdle into something darker, sending his protégé down a disorienting rabbit hole that may cost him more than he ever bargained for.  
 
>The film features a dynamic supporting cast including alternative comedy legend Tim Heidecker (First Time Female Director, Us) and Australian comic Jim Jefferies (The Jim Jefferies Show), plus MMA heavyweight fighter Maurice Greene and hip hop phenoms Guapdad 4000 and Grammy nominee Tierra Whack, all three in their feature film debuts.

Considering if they might pull additional inspirations from that specific era, I think the most notable BND storylines (specifically BND not the entire slott era) were New Ways to Die: where the Thunderbolts (including Bullseye) were hunting Spider-man on government official Norman Osborn's orders, and Grim Hunt: where Kraven is brought back to life and Spidey struggles with wanting to kill him while wearing his (cloth) black suit.

In the older spoof movies, references were always sprinkled on. And even without understanding it, the joke would usually work. I remember when I first watched Spaceballs, I had no idea what Perrier was. But it didn't matter, because the concept of canned air was absurd enough that it was funny anyway. Understanding the reference gave me something extra.

In post-scary movie era, if you didn't get the reference, the joke just simply didn't land. I got a sense that they clearly wanted me to laugh here, but I had nothing to go on. They also focused too much on number of gags and central plot was either nonexistent or it had nothing to do with what would happen next.

To be a writer for movies and TV, it takes more than being a comedian. Because you need to cram as many jokes as possible in the allotted time. Some might work, some don't. It's extremely difficult, takes several attempts and works better with teams of different backgrounds so the jokes appeal to multiple groups of people.

In the 70s and 80s, there was a monoculture. Everyone watched the same movies, the same 4 TV channels and listened to the same 3 or 4 genres of music. So making parodies and satires was simpler. It's still a remarkable feat though",13,2025-03-26 12:42:40,elcojotecoyo

You only need to look at the transition from Mel Brooks to [Friedberg and Seltzer ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Friedberg_and_Aaron_Seltzer) to see how the genre was brutally massacred by people who had neither wit or understanding thereof. Nor did they have an affection for their targets. 

They aren't solely responsible mind you, but somehow gross and cringe got mistaken for funny. Sure audiences may have been laughing, but it was uncomfortable laughter. It didn't help that a lot of it was mean spirited and hateful as well.

Parodies and spoofs only work when the filmmakers have an affection or fondness for what they were lampooning.

Who bought popcorn and a drink, booked a sitter and carpooled, and stood in the lobby afterwards and talked and made a friend. I want to thank you all who watched more than once, who recommended the film to others, both in person and on social media or on your text message chains.

>I had the gift of the opportunity of making a film inspired by my family and my ancestry but it was always a film that we wanted to make for audiences, in theaters. We always had our minds on you, the audience, and felt a deep responsibility to entertain you, and move you in the way only cinema can. 

>I believe in cinema. I believe in the theatrical experience. I believe it is a necessary pillar of society. It’s why me and so many of my colleagues have dedicated our lives to the craft. We don’t get to do what we do if you don’t show up.

>The global theatrical audience has allowed me to dream, find a career, and build a more sustainable life for me and my family. And the only way that I know how to thank you for that, is by continuing to mine my personal human experience and my relationships for more stories to being you in cinematic language. To see your response to the film has re-invigorated me and many others who believe in this art form.

>Every time you show up to theaters, you allow us to come back and do it again.

The phrase, ""This is where I came in,"" refers to going to the movies and watching until the cycle repeats.

Psycho changed that because Hitchcock was worried about spoilers making sure the shower scene had the greatest impact.  So theaters would not seat anyone after the movie began.

Usually, you go in midway through the movie and watch it until the end. There is a 10 minute or so intermission were they clean the theater, then movie trailers show and then the movie starts again. We would then watch up to the point where we initially entered the theater, then leave. Going ""oh so that's who/what they were talking about"" when the movie inevitably looped back to the beginning was par for the course for us when watching movies during that time.

Sometimes, movies were so good that my siblings or I would beg our mom to stay and watch until the movie ends again. I remember doing this for movies like Jurassic Park, Face/off, Con Air, Air Force One and Speed.

movies,1jvy3xi,mme1v8s,"I loved the second film at the time. The first was a pretty simple good vs evil plot. The basic notion, that life might be a dream from which we can awake, was already commonplace if you read science fiction. It was old even when it appeared in *Alice Through the Looking Glass*.

The second opened it out a lot, and is a lot more nuanced. We had three factions rather than two, with humans vs machines vs Smith. We got a lot of side-factions, like the Merovingian and his wife, who are not part of any of the main factions and doing their own thing. Morpheus was revealed to be a religious nutter not respected by his own people, which seemed right to me. The Oracle is revealed to be a machine, so not all machines are bad. And perhaps best of all, the nonsense about humans providing electrical power isn't mentioned, so you can believe it was something Morpheus misunderstood.

movies,1jvy3xi,mmee24a,"

I appreciate the sequels as flawed as they are, even the 4th. My biggest criticism (or justification for the inconsistency) is that the original trilogy, isn't really a trilogy. The first movie is standalone as is. That's done. The 2nd and 3rd, are basically just one story itself split into two parts. While the 4th again, is the actual 3rd chapter in their ""trilogy."" That trilogy being Neo and Trinitys story only.

We know Neo is important, but the weight and definitive consequences for him failing are lost along the way, especially by the end of Reloaded and that cliffhanger. The first movie again I won't dwell on that as much, but the 2/3 as a continuation rely on each other completely, in the same way as Pirates 2/3 or SW5/6 do. Now that's not necessarily the main problem itself. But as an overarching world narrative and culmination of the entire in world universe, the gaps themselves are working against the overall objective. 

The actual problem with the trilogy as a whole, is that the theme of ""revelations"" and ""prophecy"" is not established coherently or consistently throughout. You can't do the ""what is the Matrix"" too many times. It's a little counterintuitive in hiding the mystery of Neo, while continuing the overarching narrative plot of everyone else and Zion. Which is then the other issue of the games and animimatrix itself, as many themes and background of the world story, actually requires viewing them or knowing ahead of time. It is explained eventually, but if the viewer has to hunt down the why, from a precedent they may not have seen, then tension and acceptance is pretty much lost entirely by the conclusion.",15,2025-04-10 15:05:38,retrocrono

This is anecdotal but when I’ve gone through periods of watching more YouTube/Twitch all of a sudden watching normal longer form content doesn’t seem as instantly gratifying. Even if YouTube videos can be long, there’s something that feels different to me. 

It does worry me that we’re getting more and more used to instantly gratifying content and the younger generation is primarily being raised on that. Movies and TV aren’t inherently better, but it does feel like we are slowly lowering the bar on quality. Content creators and business are getting better at knowing what keeps us engaged, and engaged doesn’t necessarily lead to a satisfying experience that is good for our brains. That’s not to say there aren’t wonderful YouTube creators out there who make incredible content, there are. But that doesn’t feel like the mass appeal of the platform.

The shoot for LotR was plauged by leaks during production, which AICN would gleefully post.

Whenever there was talks of maybe Elijah Wood not being right for Frodo or New Line balking at reshoot costs, reports would show up on AICN with geek calls of ""stop studio interference""! 

The suits at New Line were *pissed* and this led to Peter Jackson having to have a meeting with mantatory attendance for the entire crew. Peter read them the riot act and said that if anyone was caught leaking he'd fire them on the spot.

(I just reread your post and realized that was the ""rival studio"" you were talking about.)

But yeah. I'm old enough that I remember reading thinkpieces at the time that laid this out. ""If that first film flops, New Line is dead,"" is the headline I remember reading sometime in November of 2001.",191,2025-04-07 00:15:20,originalchaosinabox

movies,1jt84ve,mls9gej,"I think about this often.

And when thinking of the development side of things, a lot of decisions seem like ""no-brainers"" and ""hell no's"" and a lot of things pass by and you go ""who the hell thought that was a good idea?""

LOTR is such a mountain that by no metric did any of what they did seem plausible. To this day and after all the BTS footage and knowledge we have of the making of those films, I still have no idea how they pulled it off. It might not be my personal favorite set of films, but I can easily say they are not only the hardest looking films to make, but considering the quality of what they turned out to be and their box office and cultural footprint, equally the best films ever made for that reason.",220,2025-04-07 00:08:37,BluRayja
movies,1jt84ve,mlsbu7n,"Im trying to think of another example of such a huge risk, Sony recently committed to FOUR Beatles movies to release in theaters within  (EDIT: *WEEKS*) of each other. Prob not as expensive as LOTR, and Sam Mendes isn’t an unknown director like Jackson was, but it’s a big risk. 

(Also I really wish Jackson was making films. But he was so cooked after The Hobbit. In the making of docs he looked so tired and just spent. So not surprising he’s spent his time doing true passion projects since then)",85,2025-04-07 00:23:47,Chessh2036
movies,1jt84ve,mlse99g,"Bob Shaye’s gamble on LotR paid off, but may have hinted at a gambler’s mentality that would eventually sink New Line. Or maybe the problem was that Shaye got rich and more successful than he ever dreamed and lost his edge. 

Barely four years after *The Return of the King* won 11 Oscars, Warner Brothers announced that it was absorbing New Line into its big-studio fold and kicking out Shaye and the man who co-founded the company with him, Michael Lynne. Why? Look at this list of New Line’s films in 2005-08:

*The New World* (2005) barely covered its budget. *Monster-in-Law* (2005), *Snakes on a Plane* (2006), and *Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny* (2006) were all flops. 

*Little Children* (2006) was actually a good movie, but have you seen it? Probably not, due to a half-hearted marketing campaign. It lost money.

Bob Shaye decided to direct his first film, *The Last Mimzy* (2007) and it was an embarrassing failure.  *Rendition* (2007) lost money. 

Worst of all, New Line’s big budget attempt to adapt Philip Pullman's *His Dark Materials* trilogy in *The Golden Compass* (2007) was a bust. New Line spent $200 million on *The Golden Compass* — as much as they spent on all three LotR films. As with LotR, they tried to decrease their risk by pre-selling foreign rights, but when the movie only made $70 million in the U.S. that wasn’t enough to prevent a devastating loss.

*Semi-Pro* (2008), *Pride and Glory* (2008), *Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay* (2008) — all flops. By the time New Line released *The Hobbit* in 2012-14, Shaye and almost everyone who worked with him were long gone.

Edit: Apparently not all the films I labeled flops lost money at the box office, but let's just say the return was disappointing. None of them were the hits needed to make up for the money lost.",64,2025-04-07 00:39:09,wjbc

movies,1jle7lo,mk2wnvk,"The car accident feeds into one of the main themes of the movie: Fate versus Chance. 

While Chigurh likes to think about himself as an Agent of Fate, we see clearly he's not. He gets creamed by the Station Wagon of Chance just like everyone else.

Carla Jean calls him out on his psychopathy and delusion on the same basis: ""I knowed you was crazy when I saw you sittin' there...the coin don't got no say -- it's just you.""",2095,2025-03-27 21:52:16,tommytraddles

Cormac McCarthy was just telling us that evil walks among us and it's out there where we least expect it, including middle class suburbia streets with your kids riding around on bikes. And that life isn't like a movie or fairy tale where the good guys always win.


That's why--as Tommy Lee Jones' character alluded to earlier in the movie in that convo with the other old cop--the new breed of evil criminal was evolving beyond his control, thus making his country one that was Not for Old Men.",478,2025-03-27 21:42:28,Alternative-Cash8411

The other is that for as much as he’s been unstoppable in the film, he too can get a wrong coin toss. Maybe he makes it out of this jam, but it shows that one day he won’t, that someone or something will end him just the same as he’s done to others.

He’s brought his own will into what has symbolically represented throughout the film as the random nature of death. He is no longer death’s chosen one, and he’s flipping the coin now just like everyone else.

But the wonderful thing about this film is that as much as I like to draw conclusions I think back to the lucky quarter quote:

“Don’t put it in your pocket, sir. Don’t put it in your pocket. It’s your lucky quarter…Anywhere not in your pocket. Where it’ll get mixed in with the others and become just a coin. Which it is.”

Chigurh insists the coin is special and then admits that it’s not. And I wonder if the Coens are fucking with me, and what they really want me to take away is that it’s “just a coin”.",41,2025-03-27 22:16:57,givin_u_the_high_hat

Kevin Kline is clearly having a ball here, Kenneth Branaugh might be a little bit wooden, but his happy-go-lucky demeanor gives the story a sense of warmth. 

The plot seems to combine ' The man who would be King' with The Music Man, and does a really good job of balancing sentimentality and humor with legitimate suspense. 

Would the film be better received by critics if it came out now?

movies,1jo0qzw,mkoszq4,"I was obsessed with this movie as a kid, and the obsession kind of returns now and then as an adult. I'd heard rumors that the movie changed significantly from its original form to what we see in the final cut, and did a bit of reading; turns out Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio, the screenwriters (also screenwriters for some of the most successful films/franchises ever, such as Pirates of the Caribbean), wrote (according to them) over 5,000 pages of material for the movie and were ultimately disappointed with how it all turned out. They alluded to a major creative decision that was made early-ish in the process that significantly altered their vision for the movie, but they liked the characters that they'd created so much that they stayed on the production anyway. 

Edit to add that iirc one of the major differences that Elliot and Rossio mentioned was that the people of El Dorado were originally supposed to abandon the city and disappear into the jungle, rather than Miguel and Tulio saving the city in its entirety. Elliot and Rossio expressed concerns over the White Savior trope (without calling it that) even way back when the movie was released.

If you look at the official soundtrack, there are songs that were never in the movie that hint at some of the lost storylines and plot points. There's a villain song, ""Trust Me,"" that seems to indicate more backstory for Chel, for example, and a song called ""16th Century Man"" that hints that Tulio and Miguel were supposed to make it back to Spain by the end of the movie and immediately start spreading the rumor that El Dorado is a just a myth. And IMO the song 'Someday Out of the Blue' hints at a different dynamic to Miguel and Tulio's relationship than the one that is in the final version of the movie. Elton John said that he actually enjoyed working on The Road to El Dorado a lot more than The Lion King, although he thinks that the final result of the film isn't as solid as the latter. 

Anyway, I love the final version of the film in spite of the screenwriters' disappointment. It's nice to have seen the love for the movie seem to grow over the years. I work in a field related to animation and when you work on a production like this, it means the world to know that something you made is still appreciated in spite of the initial box office letdown.",53,2025-03-31 14:17:10,originalcondition

movies,1jwct2t,mmiyzgv,"Another thing that happens is that a production company will have an output deal with international distributors, where the distributors agree in advance to pay a % of production costs for future movies in exchange for rights in their territory. 

So for example a distributor in the UK buys a film from Summit Entertainment and pays 10% of the budget, but they also agree to buy the next 5 films and pay 10% of those budgets, without even knowing what the films will be. 

So the production company does this a bunch of times until they have 100% financing for their next 5 films. They now have zero risk. So they just go and buy and 5 crappy scripts, over-pay some mid-level cast to appear in them since those salaries are already covered, release in the US with a minimal marketing spend so that you don't lose money there, and then you've got a free movie starring Tom Hardy or someone that you can flip to Netflix for a few million $. 

Just rinse and repeat this, it's an infinite money glitch and floods the market with poor quality movies. 

I think this happens less now as everyone got wise to the scam, but in the 2000s and 2010s it was a major business model.

2.- I have to travel further, which means that i also have to sort of plan my day around going to the theater.

4.-Prices. I also have to take into account the prices of snacks and stuff like that.

5.- Automatization is lame; last few times i went to the theater i found that some places operate with fewer people and were replaced instead with these auto charge machines, the problem is that they are buggy and you often end up getting help from an employee anyway, which just defeats the whole purposeof that, not to mention that you get confusing menus etc. Also it's fucking crap that they take away people's jobs.",4,2025-04-21 16:45:54,Mexican-Kahtru

The A24 rep asked me what I thought of it and I told her it made me feel like I was watching Uncut Gems. It did a fantastic job of building tension and keeping the viewer on edge.

During the post film Q&A the writer was asked about the politics of the film. He said he can see how the film comes off as anti-war, but his sole intention was to just make a war movie that replicates the experiences of soldiers and the effect it had on them.

movies,1jlvfq8,mkju16n,"I have also seen the movie, my full review is here: https://youtu.be/-SLBRhitA7k?si=ACxTE7Fluyd1RaQ9.

What makes the movie truly unique–what separates it from not only other Iraq War films, but war films in general–is that it is a tragedy of errors. Its subjects are not supermen. The film doesn’t deify them or make them out to be badasses. They're portrayed as barely more than boys--highly trained, highly equipped, and very brave, yes,--but still immature and prone to mistakes. Characters run into the sides of doors, the injured are accidentally stepped on, etc., just to name a few of the least consequential mishaps. And then, of course, the granddaddy mistake–the original shit, running ever downhill–is that they’re in this war in the first place. These cascading errors don’t just give the film a sense of realism, but add to a compounding dread that the story is not moving in the right direction. ",75,2025-03-30 17:39:50,FeatureUnderground

movies,1k0nfel,mngbpv7,"Hughes was known to have early cuts that were excessively long. The first cut of Planes, Trains, and Automobiles was something like four and a half hours long, and remnants of its trimmed runtime can be found throughout the film. Off the top of my head:

\-Neil mentions that Del went into his wallet for pizza. In this sequence Del stiffs the delivery boy on the tip, who then returns to rob them in the middle of the night. When they discover they have no money to pay for breakfast the next morning, Del talks their way out of the bill.

\-In the scene featuring Michael McKean, you can see his jacket is that of an Indiana state trooper, indicating that they'd overshot their destination and had to turn around.

\-Toward the end of the film, a shiner appears on Del's eye, as though someone punched him in the face. It stays there for the rest of the film. Could have been Neil, but we don't see how he got it.

\-When they finally arrive back at Neil's home, his wife is crying. Naturally we're left to assume that she is distraught by his absence, but the actual reason is because she thought he was cheating on her. This was an entire B-plot that they cut.",45,2025-04-16 18:33:36,8bit-wizard

We know his brother killed himself by jumping off a roof, and that Mark was on the phone with him and couldn't stop him. I took it as a sign that Mark - normally so full of life in everything he does even if he's miserable - is finally considering just giving up like his brother did, at the realisation that the banks knew what they were doing and didn't care. Like Christian Bale's character says in his sign-off email, the business almost kills the human parts of him.

It's a pretty dark reading of that scene and if it's there it's subtle. But everything on screen is a decision and I feel like that one was deliberate. It also makes him and Bale's guy proxies for the hopeless anger that the audience feels at how it all went down.",53,2025-04-11 00:25:51,night_dude

And when this once in a lifetime opportunity for dipshits evaporated, they had no transferable skills they could take with them.  
  
One thing I learned from this period of time is that when there's a new, high margin product, it attracts the sharks.  I later went on to be a part of deregulated energy (when consumers got the choice between buying their electricity from the utility at 9 cents/kWh or from a retail supplier at 5.5 cents/kWh).
