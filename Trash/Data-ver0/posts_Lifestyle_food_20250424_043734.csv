food,1jzyr1y,[Homemade] Potato Terrine,"While it may be a little time consuming, it's still easy, so don't just be a spec-tater, this Potato Terrine is quite a-peeling! 🤣

Mix some heavy cream with salt, garlic powder, and grated parm then thinly slice (or use a mandolin) some potatoes and toss them in the mix.

Line a baking dish with parchment paper leaving enough over the edges to fold over the top and make a few layers of potato at the bottom. Drizzle with melted butter then repeat potato and butter until the pan is about half full. You can go higher if you want to make them bigger. Fold the parchment paper over the top, cover w/ tin foil and bake at tree fiddy until they're soft and tender.

Remove and let cool for about 15 minutes then use something heavy to press down on the top, a 5lb bag of flour worked perfect for me 😂 and chill in the fridge overnight.

The next day, slice and brown the cut sides in olive oil and you're H-O-T-P-O-T-A-T-O or whatever Chappelle Roan yells about...if you're serving as a side, trim the ends off and top with a scallion, I had these with some 420 garlic butter 😆
