gaming,1jocrk8,S.T.A.L.K.E.R. - Shadow of Chernobyl,"I played this game years ago when it came out. It was from a time when games were more or less linear. I remember playing it through, getting to the very end - the room that granted you that which you really desired. What did I get? Buried by coins. I found it really funny (and confusing) at the time, only later found that the game had like 3 possible endings. More recently have been reflecting on the value of giving to others, and that ending has been replaying in my mind. Has stuck with me. I wonder if it's reflective of how I live my life.

gaming,1ju1y0a,Looking for game recommendations similar to Hollow Knight.,"So I am looking for games with similar gameplay to Hollow Knight. It was my first metroidvania. Currently stuck trying to beat Pantheon 5 though.

I have played both Ori games and found the second to be the best. The fighting mechanics weren't my favorite but it was fun. The movement abilities to make exploring faster was great.

I am almost done with Nine Sols. At the final boss. The game is enjoyable more than it is not, but after going back to Hollow Knight after a few weeks of this game made me appreciate Hollow Knight more. The fighting just feels so much more smooth compared to Nine Sols.

I tried Animal Well. Was not my favorite and dropped it before beating it.

I have played other platformers. Downwell was great, leap year was a little enjoyable. I played Webbed. Was trying to 100% it, never beat it. I did not like how hard it was to back track in the tree area...

I currently have Celeste, Blade Kitten (played, like, haven't beaten yet), Inside, Limbo.

But I know none of them have gameplay similar to Hollow Knight. It doesn't have to be a Metroid or Platformer or 2D. Just more games with fast and smooth boss fights like Hollow Knight would be appreciated.

Should probably mention I currently only have a PC.",10,0.58,107,2025-04-08 01:29:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1ju1y0a/looking_for_game_recommendations_similar_to/,AtticusSpindel
gaming,1k1h9kz,Does anyone know of game journal/diary apps?,"I honestly had no idea where to go for this and all my searches have turned up the wrong things so far so maybe you guys might know something I don’t. Something I would really like to find if at all possible is an app on either iOS or Android (I have an iPhone and a Galaxy Tab) where I can write\* my own journal entries and keep track of various things while I play. I really struggle a lot these days with games especially with games of my favourite genre of RPGs, and I really need things that can help me manage my memory.

I know that things like Notion or even the notes app exist but they don’t really seem to have what I’m looking for. The closest I’ve seen is something like Shattered Ring for Elden Ring. One of the things that makes apps like Notion less ideal is how they are set up and layed out. Also Shattered Ring is more specific and I am hoping to find something that can be used across games. Either it would be generic enough while still game focused or it would be able to change its setup per game. A final thing I’m hoping to find is the ability to Dictate to the app from the lock or Home Screen via a shortcut or widget. This would mean I could easily talk my thoughts as I am playing without having to stop and type.

Thanks for listening to this odd one and hopefully someone out there knows of something that will work

gaming,1jztbpv,A REVELATION: The movie Gremlins and Ape Escape,"I can't believe that there has not been a (modern) video game for Gremlins. In addition to this, I also think that Ape Escape's type of gameplay is almost perfect for a Gremlins game, give or take a few changes to the mechanics. Check it:

\- In Ape Escape, you run around capturing apes that have been let loose and are running and hiding across several maps. Swap out the apes with gremlins (duh), instead of capturing apes, you're killing gremlins, make the main character (Billy or Kate, each who have a skill that the other does not), and make the maps different locations from the films and a few more places.

\- Like Ape Escape, it would be a third-person view so you can see the character model you're playing as. Shit, add a photo mode with fun poses and faces so you can take photos of yourself with the different gremlins you're hunting!

\- Ape Escape is a kid-friendly game whereas Gremlins is, of course, a dark comedy/monster movie. The game should absolutely be the same, with the jokes, language, and violent ways of dispatching gremlins (Blender, guns, electricity, traps, sunlight, etc.) the monster violence would be gratuitous and over the top, just like in the movies. 

\- Think of all of the different gremlin designs throughout all the movies! Mogwai (duh), The spider, the bat, Mohawk, Greta, Stripe, Daffy, the vegetable gremlin, and all of the other ones I can't remember... Some of them could be level bosses or can only be caught in specific ways (like in Ape Escape, where some run and hide, some attack, and others just run around)

\- You could have a level where after you rescue Mogwai (perhaps a final level), there's a gremlin (boss) that is spraying water at you and you have to avoid getting Mogwai wet -- If you get hit with water more gremlins spawn from him. In order to beat the level, you have to kill all of the gremlins and the boss. 

\- There can be little side missions to do on every level: rescue NPCs from gremlins, find old books and ancient artifacts that show gremlins throughout history, collect multiple weapon parts to build a special weapon for each level, prevent a gremlin from touching water in time to avoid more gremlins spawning, etc.

\- The levels could be the many different locales from the movies: Billy's house/neighborhood, the movie theater, the Clamp Center lab, the YMCA, the bank, New York City, etc.

We are now working on a setting book, which we aim to make compatible with as many TTRPG systems as possible, that brings the high speed post apocalyptic fantasy of *Mad Max* and the Sci-Fi/Magic epic of *DUNE* together into one desert meteor crash site known to all as ***Scorched Basin***.

What are your favourite aspects of Mad Max and/or DUNE? What would you hope to capture in your world if you were in our shoes?

gaming,1k32py5,What is your favourite video of gameplay?,"Recently I rewatched [EVE Online - The Battle of Asakai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLqb-m1ZZUA) and it is just so good. The Fleet Commanders relaying orders to try and capture the Leviathan class titan before it can get out, the continuous escalation of forces on both sides, the music, and the sheer visual spectacle!

It made me aware of EVE Online at the time, after which I played it for a good few years. And I keep returning to it to enjoy it again. It has almost become a comfort video of sorts.

gaming,1jzoxjx,Crisis Core/Valhalla Knights Like Games,"Final Fantasy 7: Crisis Core and Valhalla Knights both share a gameplay style that I really don't ever see anymore. They're both 3d maps where you go to a ""dungeon"" (yes, a ""field dungeon"" is still a type of dungeon) and encounters are visible on the map (so far this is consistent with most FF games) where you can dodge encounters, find chests, and do quests. An important aspect of what I am looking for is that the combat is NOT turn based, even if its real time turn based. 

I've been playing through Valhalla Knights recently and its really scratching an itch, but I'd love to see if anyone knows of any newer games that have the same gameplay style. The first Valhalla Knights has a decent amount of content to it (easily 40 hours of gameplay to complete, though it does get pretty repetitive and grindy), but there is almost NOTHING but combat. Also, its not exactly smooth. I find the movement gums up frequently, and there is a lot of ""walk in circles till you find the quest goal, teleport back to town, and then walk back a mile to do it 2 more times"". 

It's been a hot minute since I played Crisis Core, but I doubt I'll be able to really get back into it for a while, since It'll be a while before I drop 50 bucks on a single player game in this economy for the remake, and the existence of the remake will make it harder to touch the original for a bit.

To be honest, I don't even think that I want another of this type of game for a bit, but I want to know of them if they exist. it's a fun little niche. Valhalla Knights has evoked a lot of the same vibes that I feel from the indie games in the Fire Emblem niche, and I'd love to see a new one come out, but since its the same studio as story of seasons, I have no idea if they'll ever touch the IP again, or if the people that worked on it are even still around.

I enjoyed it's meele combat especialy with the classic board and sword loadout. It took some time getting used to the whole combat system but while simple on the surface it has some depth to it. Timing to blocking/parrying is crucial and you have to pick your fights wisely.

Fast forward to today and I felt like picking it up again, hopped in and checked the games settings because I upgraded my graphics card and were about to adjust them when I acciendently stumbled upon the UI/HUD settings. To immersive myself more into the game I decided to turn off all HUD elements and gave it a spin and oh boy the game experience was soooo much better!

No longer got I distracted by all the HUDs elements and also it was really refreshing to experience a game's world with out getting your hand hold.

Previously I played Ghost of Tsushima which reduces your HUD to a minimum and while traversing the map is complete without a HUD and I felt like it was a bold but great decision by it's devs.

So my conclusion to this post is that more game devs should design there games with a minimum of HUD elements or even without one.

gaming,1k59jcp,"Looking for games with smooth, challenging, immersive combat","This is random but I’m just curious if there’s anything out there I’ve missed out on. My favorite combat system by far is God of War, and I’ve yet to find a game that gets even close to the level of creativity and expressiveness you can have with combat in those games. I love souls games and just beat Elden Ring but compared to GoW the dodging system and animations just feel clunky. It feels like I’m playing a video game. I love souls for the challenge aspect but for me it’s not remotely as fun and expressive as GoW. I played ER as a mage trying to mix it up a bit from souls and that was probably a mistake as I ended up just spamming the same spell 90% of the time, but still. I’ve never played Sekiro and everyone raves about the combat so I’ll try it, but I’ve never been blown away by Fromsoft combat. Playing Bloodborne after GoW for example felt like I was playing something from the early 2000s, and it’s only 3 years older than GoW. 

Anyway bring on the downvotes, but other combat systems I’ve enjoyed are Horizon Zero Dawn, Zelda BoW, and if I recall I actually liked the soulslike combat in Code Vein more than actual souls games, but it’s been a minute.

You startet as a shapeless pixelfigure in a very zoomed in 2D pixel-diorama with the FOV expanding the more you went on.  
The level design was dystopian/post-apocalypse with overgrown ruins, huge alien like skeletons and toxic wastelands. All usually in a circle like map. Not much text, if at all, iirc.  
The goal was to reach the portal to the next ""world"".  
After five or six worlds you would reach an escape pod shooting straight into the nearby sun with a final text that said something like ""Silence, at last."" or maybe ""Finally, peace.""

The soundtrack was atmospheric and fitting to the bleak and kind of sad scenery.

I've been trying to remember a game that I played a very long time ago. I believe it was either on the Super Nintendo or the PS1.

\-There were I think 2 playable characters. One of them was a buff dude in overalls (brown I think?) and I think only one side was buttoned. I believe this character did some sort of jump attack where he would just kinda throw his body at you in the air.

Options are Enshrouded, Helldivers 2, Risk of Rain 2.

We are looking for a fun new adventure game for 2 players coop. No real preference between 3rd/1st, shooter/survivor/RPG  
We like games with a feeling of progression and teamwork. I like goals to complete. We like the progression survival games offer, but are wary of the monotony.

Risk of rain 2 Pros:

looks good because of gameplay, teamwork, definite direction/goal, sense of progression. cheap right now.

cons: minimal permanent progression, worried about monotony, bullet sponge bosses.

Helldivers 2 pros: gameplay looks very fun, upgrades and ship upgrades permanent. looks like so much fun on gameplay videos

cons: if its better with >2 people, may be difficult as my internet isnt great with handling larger online games. worried the lack of story may mean it feels a bit like cod? expensive.

Enshrouded pros: we both like survival games (i have 225 hrs on 7 days to die), this game has the most definite/permanent progression, looks really cool. friend already owns it.

cons: lack of clear main story, open world and survival aspect may make it seem grindy/slow/pointless, may get boring after a while if so. early access, worried about bugs. as a survival game, progression may be quite slow.

I googled very little so I'm not sure of this is true but it doesnt seem to be known at this point the gender of the main character, which can be completely irrelevant to the actual game (its also possible that a translator or AI translation used the word just because); but it got me thinking, what if its not irrelevant? what if, for some reason or other, its something to surprise the player akin to samus aran reveal.

For me, it's probably the Sims 1 OST. 

I used to play Sims 1 around the time it was brand new (I don't think I was old enough to have started school yet when I started playing) and I remember liking the songs back then. Seeing the expectations and patterns that a lot of kids prefer now compared to back then, I find it difficult to believe anyone born after 2008 would appreciate anything Sims-related pre-3. Idk, I haven't looked into demographics so it's all just a wild guess. By that logic though, I could just list every game I've played that was released before 2002. Aside from nostalgia, Sims 1 music has a charm that's definitely been ramping up to eventually release games with amazing OST like Urbz: Sims in the City (released shortly after Sims 2).

I don't disagree, but thinking about it, I feel like in general game boxes aren't what they used to be.

The PS5 boxes, while probably the least egregious of the current gen systems, I feel aren't quite as good as the PS4's. I think the bright white color scheme just clashes with boxart more often than the blue color scheme of the PS4 did. And the current XBOX banner isn't much better than the Switch 2's. Do you suppose this is just a product of the more minimalist logos companies are using that they have to use more garish colors to set themselves apart, or is it a different trend altogether?

But not for me. I want to start playing games, that are worth it. No Micro-Microtransactions, no ranked grind. I want to explore, fight, loot, build and most-I want to have fun after all these years. I want to experience singleplayer Games. And I want to be able to pause the game because I want to take a break mid game maybe and i also have a girlfriend :D so there is not time and sense to grind ranked

gaming,1k20rav,Why isn't there more focus on pure simulation this generation?,"For all the leaps and bounds we've had in processing power over the last 2 - 3 generations of consoles, I feel like devs haven't focussed enough on the things that would really push gaming to the next level. There was a time that games were blowing our minds constantly for doing something new and unique. Metal Gear has always made huge leaps forward with every entry. Red Faction and Battlefiled gave us amazing destruction. Half Life 2 is still impressive a little over 20 years later. We all have that series that we wish was still going or at the very least influenced other devs to iterate on a great gameplay mechanic. So my point is, why aren't there more narrative driven open world immersive sims? Like Freeguy which is basically GTA online but with a persistent destructable map with a realtime day night cycle? It wouldn't even have to be present day. You could go past, present or future here. You could do so much with a small town full of unique characters all with thier own lives and a friend/ enemy gossip system. Like Fargo or Breaking Bad as an immersive sim would be NUTS.

gaming,1jtbddv,Somewhat Chill game(s) with decent story and engaging gameplay. (Console),"I'm going to be ""out of commission"" for a short time, and need something that's not too tense to play. I'm not asking for no combat, but maybe something with relatively easy or not very strenuous.  Like this would be a good time to play Warzone, but that or any multiplayer games like that would be a bit too much with needing the quick reactions.

I want something fun and engaging to play, preferably with an interesting story. I don't want a game like Minecraft, Stardew Valley, Unpacking, or Telltale games. Games that I would consider somewhat ""chill"" and not too tense would be games like GTA, Call of Duty and Halo single players. And although I only brought up shooters, it doesn't have to be shooters. Like I'll play some Balatro during this time for sure.

I would also prefer not a super long game, but also not super short. One game I could see being suggested that unfortunately wouldn't be good suggestion (for me), is Skyrim. Skyrim like games just have not really captured me. I've tried a few times and it's just never hooked me. I don't think those type of games are bad, They just have never been able to keep my interest.

It seems to me that *most* games with multiple endings don’t necessarily make it easy to find the good ending on first go and I’m sure that’s partly a deliberate choice to keep players coming back. In any case, I was interested to hear of favourite examples of games that give you a reasonable chance of getting the “good” ending on first try?

A few caveats for the sake of discussion: 

* Obviously just talking about games that are sufficiently complex and don’t come down to a final singular decision to decide the ending.

* Also, excluding “perfect” or “better than good” endings or anything that’s generally deliberately hard to get, requires some fore-knowledge of the story or are literally locked on first play-through.

So which is more important? If it's story, then many many AA and indies games should be scoring at the same level as AAA titles. If it's gameplay, then many AAA titles should be scored much harsher.

Just, I find it strange that indie and smaller titles can at times get praise for their story, but still get a low score because the gameplay is the weakest part; While big budget titles can have weak gameplay yet still score nearly 9's and 10s simply because the story is great.
