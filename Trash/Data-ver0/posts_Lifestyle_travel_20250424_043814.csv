travel,1jzu96a,Air China lost my baggage,"3 days ago, I had a stopover in Beijing on my way to Paris and Air China managed to lose my baggage. I don’t travel a lot, only once every two or three years so I guess I am just being unlucky.

I have not received any updates since I reported the loss. The website I have redirected to says « search ongoing ». It has been 72 hours already and I think my baggage is lost forever.

Hopefully, I didn’t have anything really important inside, only shopping stuff.

I will try to get my insurance involved, but I read on other reddit posts that Air China sometimes refuses to admit they lost the baggage.

It is so frustrating that I want to break things
How can they even lose stuff ?? Seriously, it is so unprofessional",24,0.88,10,2025-04-15 15:07:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jzu96a/air_china_lost_my_baggage/,AnnualPrint542

travel,1k3fcg1,Aeromexico gauges the price if you have a voucher and try to use,"I had my flight rebooked last year due to circumstances and Aeromexico gave my family three vouchers.

  
I am trying to book a flight using the Aeromexico website in incognito window it shows me $2900 for our family. When I call to book this same flight using the vouchers, the price they give me is $4100 and I have around $1300 in vouchers, so the end price ends up being around $2800. 

Absolutely ridiculous. The person on the callcenter basically doesn't know why but says he cannot do anything about it as he doesn't have access to the price I am seeing.

  
Same dates, same flight numbers, same amount of people. 

  
I saw the same issue when I tried to rebook a flight with Aeromexico, the ""fees"" to rebook were essentially the price of the flight.

travel,1k1t67z,My Personal Tips for an Amazing Trip to Bali,"Just got back from a few weeks in Bali and honestly, it was one of the most unforgettable trips I’ve ever taken. If you’re planning to go, here are a few things I learned that might make your trip smoother (and way more fun!):



**1. Respect the Culture**

One of the first things I noticed in Bali is how spiritually rich and respectful the culture is. If you’re visiting temples, bring or borrow a sarong and sash (most temples have them at the entrance). People are incredibly welcoming when you show even a bit of effort.

**2. A Few Words Go a Long Way**

Learning simple phrases like “Terima kasih” (thank you) and “Permisi” (excuse me) made every local interaction feel more genuine. Locals really appreciate it.

**3. Gojek and Grab Are Lifesavers**

These apps were game changers. I used Grab to get around Ubud and Canggu, and Gojek for food delivery after long beach days. Prices are super reasonable too.

**4. Always Keep Cash**

Even though I used my card at cafes and beach clubs, I needed cash for markets, scooters, and small restaurants. I’d suggest exchanging a little at the airport and topping up at local money changers (look for the legit ones).

**5. Sort Out an eSIM Before You Land**

Seriously, this saved me so much hassle. You can use any eSIM like Airalo & Holafly. But, personally I used Jetpac and activated it right before my flight. It worked instantly when I landed and I can used it as a hotspot too. Their plans quite affordable than the kiosk at the airport. Highly recommend setting this up before you go.

**6. Scooter Adventures (and Caution!)**

I rented a scooter for a few days, such a fun way to explore. But Bali traffic can be intense, especially in Seminyak. Definitely wear a helmet and don’t rush it if you’re not confident.

**7. Off the Beaten Path**

While the usual spots like Uluwatu and Kuta were cool, my favorite part of the trip was exploring Sidemen and Amed. Way quieter, and the landscapes were just stunning.



If you have any other tips, let's share them!",24,0.74,10,2025-04-18 01:27:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k1t67z/my_personal_tips_for_an_amazing_trip_to_bali/,FinalCall8
travel,1k0h5gk,"Kids booked under mom's flight reservation, but now flying with dad – will this be an issue?","Hoping someone has experience with this. We booked international flights for our family (Rome to the US), but due to changing plans, Mom can no longer take the same flight. The kids were originally booked with Mom under one reservation/confirmation number, and Dad has a separate reservation number for the same flight.

Now, Dad will be traveling with the kids on that flight. Since the kids' tickets are technically under the mom's reservation (even though they're confirmed and paid for), will there be any issues at check-in or boarding since Mom won’t be flying?

Do we need to call the airline to split the reservation or link Dad’s info somehow? Or will it be fine as long as the kids are accompanied by a parent and have valid tickets?

Appreciate any advice or insight, especially from anyone who's dealt with international flights and traveling with kids under different bookings. Just want to avoid any last-minute airport surprises.

Thanks in advance!

  
UPDATE: I called the airline and they gave me 2 options to sort it out.

1 - I asked them if merging the reservations is possible and they mentioned merging the reservations would not be possible. However what they could do is do a name change and switch the passengers so that they change mom's name to dad's on the ticket with the kids then on dad's ticket, they will change it to mom's.

2 - They could split mom form her reservation with the kids so that the kids have their own reservation, mom has her own and dad has his own. They are unable to merge dad's with the kids', they will create what they call a Travel -together which lets the airport staff aware that passengers are traveling together.

I guess, I will go with option2 and travel with kids birth certificates.  Thank you every for the helpful comments.",24,0.71,29,2025-04-16 10:31:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k0h5gk/kids_booked_under_moms_flight_reservation_but_now/,egonakamura

travel,1jm0ouv,Turkish Airlines' Refund Process: A Masterclass in Bureaucratic Nonsense,"So, here’s my story. I booked a flight from Pakistan to the Bahamas with Turkish Airlines, paid in cash, and—surprise, surprise—the flight got canceled. Fine, things happen. I was then asked to book another flight. The next available one i booked was a month later and happened to be $400 cheaper. I was assured that I would be reimbursed for the difference if I took that flight.

Fast forward—I took the flight, I’m in the Bahamas, and my refund? Nowhere to be seen. After countless follow-ups, sending my brother multiple times to the Turkish Airlines office in Islamabad, and submitting refund requests online, I finally got a response. And what a response it was! Instead of addressing my query, they sent me a generic email stating that my ticket has already been used. Thank you, Turkish Airlines, for that groundbreaking insight.

But here’s where it gets truly ridiculous—apparently, to get my own money back, I need to travel to **Panama** because the nearest office of TK is in Panama. Yes, you read that right. Turkish Airlines thinks it makes perfect sense for me to book another international flight, spend hundreds of dollars, and go through immigration just to claim a refund they owe me. Oh, and it's not like I can send someone on my behalf—no, no, this refund is apparently a sacred artifact that only I, personally, am worthy of retrieving.

At this point, I’m not even mad about the Panama thing (okay, I am), but all I’m asking is to simply **use my $400 credit for my next flight next month**. Is that really so difficult? If Turkish Airlines can reroute flights across the globe, surely they can manage to apply a credit to a future booking.

Has anyone else experienced this level of absurdity with Turkish Airlines? Any advice on how to deal with this? Because at this point, I feel like I need a **visa sponsorship from Panama just to get my refund.**

travel,1jt5x3x,Sabbatical suggestions for adventurous destinations far from the East Coast US,"If you're an American who browses here, you already know that our meager PTO combined with the size of our country makes it hard to venture to the other side of the world. That's why I'm planning to quit my job and take a 4-6 month sabbatical (probably not this year). The idea is to embrace the adventures I've been putting off for ""one day when I have the time"". To not give a shit that takes 2 full days to reach the destination and another 2 days to get home. 

I want to take 2 trips during my sabbatical, and I have already decided on **Indonesia** for the first one. I am looking for a second destination and am curious where you would go in this scenario.

**Criteria:**

1. Probably Asia, Africa, or Oceania - these are pretty far from the eastern US and the goal is to take advantage of actually having time for once. Europe, Latin America, and the Carribbean are easily doable while employed lol

2. Not Indonesia - I've already decided this will be the first of my 2 sabbatical trips.  Even though it's not cost effective, I will go home in between and will NOT be traveling from Indonesia to the 2nd destination

3. Vibrant local culture - I'm open to both touristy and off-the-beaten path places, but I'd like to avoid resorts and towns that revolve around resorts. I'm more interested in local culture than relaxation, even if there is a lot of tourism there. I am a tourist, after all. 

4. Access to beautiful nature and outdoor adventures - one of the goals of this trip is challenge myself physically. I'm no Olympic athlete but I can handle most outdoor activities. 

5. Ancient historical sites - old ruins, temples, etc are just an area of fascination for me

6. Budget - not a huge concern 

7. Length of Stay 4-5 weeks. I am an active traveler and definitely prefer bouncing around to different areas over slow travel. 

**Some Ideas I Have, But Would Love Your Opinion**

1. Sri Lanka 

2. Southern India (Goa, Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu)

3. Ethiopia 

4. Tasmania/New Zealand

5. Cape Verde

travel,1jq95n2,Agoda does NOT help you if you are scammed,"TL;DR:   
They will side with the scammer and keep your money, even if you have proof of not being able to get in touch with the host.

I booked an apartment in Kuala Lumpur through Agoda. There was no communication from the host prior to check in, so I sent them a message on the platform, an email and called them. No response. So I called Agoda, and they claimed they were able to get in touch with the host. They left my number with the host so they could call me. I sent the host another message on the platform, called multiple times (easily 20), and no-one picked up.

I went to the address, and to my horror there were two other groups experiencing the exact same thing, with [booking.com](http://booking.com) and Agoda. They were also not able to get in touch with their host. 

I called Agoda again, and they kept insisting that the host was ""honoring the booking"" and they could do nothing. 

I end up getting a hotel for the night. The next day Agoda informs me over email that I was marked as a ""no-show"", and that the will keep the entire payment. I called again, and sent them proof of me trying to get in touch with the host, including screen shots of call log, the email I sent them and photos from outside the building.   
I was shocked when they told me that it was up to the host to refund me. In my eyes this is clearly a scam, but Agoda would do nothing to help.   
Obviously the host refused the refund, and now Agoda is saying there is nothing they can do. 

What a nightmare situation, I can't believe they just take the word of the host like that. ",15,0.67,29,2025-04-03 04:21:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jq95n2/agoda_does_not_help_you_if_you_are_scammed/,pplazer
travel,1jn7zw1,Should we go to Patagonia or Galapagos?,"My partner and I are from Australia and are travelling to South America for the first time this November. 

Machu Picchu is on both our bucket lists (we are hiking the Inca trail) so we’re definitely spending some time in Peru. The plan from there was to always go to Galapagos as I’ve wanted to go since a friend raved about it, however this week Patagonia came up too. 

I know Peru to Galapagos is a bit of an easier itinerary.

I love the idea of both but can’t make up my mind. Realistically this will be our last trip before we have kids, and I don’t think either are achievable with kids. I want to explore, see as much wildlife as we can. We’re both both beach and mountain people, we love to get outside. 

What will still be around in 15-20 years? I keep thinking this is our only chance to get to either which isn’t true. 

What would you do when you’re still young and child free? 

ETA: We are a little hesitant on Galapagos for logistical reasons as my partner doesn’t t like boats and the boat tour option is pricey, but I think we could stay on the islands  easily. 

We are looking to spend around 3 weeks to 3.5 weeks in total

travel,1jofmd7,Traveling to India first time in 10 years. Thoughts,"Hi Everyone! 

I just wanted to come on here and give my thoughts of visiting India as an Indian American after not visiting in 10 years. 

I enjoyed India in two ways as a foreign tourist (Agra) and as a somewhat local (with family in karnataka) 

I primarily stayed in Bengaluru with my family and did a few trips to Coorg, Mysore, and Agra. 

First Did a roadtrip from Bangalore to coorg and mysore and I just want to get started by saying if you haven’t heard of coorg UR MISSING OUT, will forever be my favorite place on earth, lush tropical evergreen forests with huge biodiversity. It’s my second time going to coorg (and mysore) and it’s still as amazing as I remember. Mysore was cool too  

It was also my first time visiting North India. Seeing the Taj Mahal has been on my bucket list since forever and seeing it in person was surreal.   
Left the hotel at 5:45 am and our guide took us to the eastern gate and dropped us 1 km away from it. When I got to the gate there was already a 500 queue 😭, was originally planning to be at the gate 5:30 am but unfortunately could not find my eticket on my phone so took like an hr to find it. Nevertheless still was able to get some solo shots with the Taj and saw the beautiful sunrise. Also it most likely not gonna beat the line so don’t be saddened when you get there and there are already a bunch of people ahead of you. 

Now just differences I saw between the north and south: 
Visiting North India vs South India is like two different countries, The south is very laid back in comparison and felt a lot more homey (makes sense tho since my family is from the south). And the north was very busy and overwhelming. 

I think if you wanna visit India please do proper research and figure out which state would best align to what you want to see in India. I honestly think that each state in India is like hoping countries in Europe. Also please don’t generalize India since it’s more diverse than Europe, what you see on the internet is not what India is like all over. 

I honestly think that every state in South India is a must visit (not biased)
For north India I cannot tell you since I’ve only been to one city and it’s not my place to talk about if I barely know how visiting the rest is. People have also told me Agra is known to be a lot dirtier in general compared to most Indian cities so like my experience there would not match other cities in North India. 

I do plan on going to more cities in the north including, Delhi, Jaipur, Chandigarh, varanasi, udaipur and more.

Also as you can see I’m really bad with words so I could’ve probably explained all of this in a more coherently descriptive way but I forgot what I was gonna type halfway through 😍.

We are a family of 4 (2 kids, 11 and 14). Planing on spending 17 nights in Southern Spain. Leaving around July 10 from Toronto. Please guide me on how many nights I should be spending in the following cities. 

So far we thought of spending:

- 3 nights in Seville
- 3 nights in either Ronda or Malaga
- 2 nights in Granada
- 2 nights in Cordoba
- 3 nights in Madrid (maybe a day trip to toledo)
- 4 nights in Barcelona

We are open to changing our iteniary. Thinking of landing in Seville and renting a car. Dropping it in Cordoba and then taking train to Madrid and finally to Barcelona? Also, would you recommend staying in a central location like Malaga and do day trips to nearby cities (less hotel hopping)?

We are interested in beautiful scenery, unique/picturesque towns, some beach activity (not a lot though), and moorish architecture. Not interested in big museums or art galleries.

travel,1jox5ek,Inner Mongolia?,"Hi, I'm a recent graduate from the UK and am going to Inner Mongolia in September with my boyfriend (who is from Hong Kong, and also speaks Mandarin).

I don't know *anyone* who has been anywhere north of Beijing, so am pretty stuck on how to do things. I am a photographer and have been given a grant from my university for a photo project on the traditional culture of Inner Mongolia - it's specified that this has to be in China, rather than the country Mongolia.

Plans so far are:

* We're flying in and out of Hailar. I've heard Hulunbuir is wilder than Hohhot, and would like to be as off the beaten track as possible
* We are flying back via Beijing, because I think it would be such a waste of a visa not to visit the Forbidden City and the Great Wall - have to do some traditional tourist things!
* 5-6 nights in Inner Mongolia? At least a few in proper yurt encampments
* Maybe staying a night in Manzhouli? Is it worth it?

I have a couple of questions and would really appreciate some answers!

1. Would we get bored after 5 days in the grasslands, or is that not enough? We want to ride, cook, meet people, take photos, and hike - also happy to volunteer to help out in settlements.
2. How can we actually sort out staying in the wild? In the limited videos and Tripadvisor reviews seen it seems like people book a private driver literally when they arrive at the airport. I definitely want some certainty beforehand...
3. How do you find a driver? There isn't an obvious travel information desk, understandably, and shelling out for a guide when we'll just want a driver and to meet local people seems unnecessary
4. My boyfriend is intrigued by the Ewenki people raising reindeer. Would it be ridiculous to try to stay or visit them? I have no idea where to start, and if this isn't normally done by tourists I assume the drivers wouldn't know exactly what to do.

I'd really appreciate some advice! I hope none of this comes across as insensitive in any way - I want to be respectful and properly honour the culture of the place I'm visiting, so if anything I've asked is stupidly/offensively/badly worded please say! I'm not sure what the vibe is with foreigners just coming up and asking to be involved - is this rude, or do people generally accept and encourage non-Chinese tourists?",13,0.75,8,2025-04-01 14:36:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jox5ek/inner_mongolia/,Careful-Builder-9931

me and my partner are currently trying to decide where to travel this summer. We only have a relatively short window where our schedules align - the first two weeks of September.
We went to Japan twice in the last two years and absolutely fell in love but we really can’t justify going again this year because there is so much more to see in this world. We are interested in South Korea or Taiwan and really can’t decide. We’re both not really into popular culture (e.g. K-Pop, K-Drama) but rather love food, temples and culture and nature. We do enjoy all the lights and billboards in cities though. Which is why we loved Japan: for the contrast between modernism and tradition.

Tap out on your stop then if you have like 3 people going out, the doors are already closing, doors doesn’t seem to have proximity sensors as well because I’ve been squished by the doors twice for the 2 days I’ve been here. 

On the trams you have a green button to press to open the door but buses don’t. How do I get off quicker? Do you have to tap before your stop? How will they get an accurate distance then? But if I have a GVB card I suppose it’s fine?

travel,1k4cgww,Small tips about taking the train between Amsterdam and Berlin,"I just boarded the direct train (Intercity Berlijn) from Amsterdam to Berlin, which I assume is a popular route for European tourists but most of the information on the official operator's website (NS) and even some information at the train station was completely wrong. So here's my experience in case it helps someone:

1. 1st class will be on 1 end of the train, but at Berlin Hauptbahnhof station, the train map was completely reversed. To make matters worse, there is actually no way to get between 2nd class and 1st class cars on this train, so literally all 1st class passengers were sprinting from 1 end of the (very crowded) platform to the other end to get onto the train (also the train arrived at 14:05 with scheduled departure of 14:10 so there was real risk you could miss the train if you didn't run). I would actually suggest standing in the middle of the platform and then you can avoid this rush either way.
2. If you book this particular train online, you can request a seat reservation but you can't select the seat, or even request a window / aisle. I strongly suggest calling the reservation hotline instead to request a specific seat.
3. For 1st class specifically, on the NS website, it said very clearly that 1st class seats only have power outlets on the window. This is false, actually there are power outlets under every seat - but only the window and middle seats have access to a desk. If you are planning to do work / use your laptop (which I assume many people are doing on this nearly 6 hour train ride) then you should really try to get the window seat >> middle seat, again which requires calling the NS phone number in advance.
4. This only changed a few months ago so I can't blame the internet for being wrong, but there is no longer a dining car on this train, just a snack cart.
5. This is just personal opinion but unlike many other intercity trains, this one actually can get quite full (according to another passenger in my compartment who travels this route regularly) and people are sitting on the floor in 2nd class. Keep in mind this is April, not even peak travel season. I would say it's pretty much a necessity to book a seat reservation in 2nd class or just spring for 1st class.",7,0.64,9,2025-04-21 12:37:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k4cgww/small_tips_about_taking_the_train_between/,Dry_Row_7523
travel,1k47543,First Time Flying Fiji Airways – Surprisingly Great Experience (DFW to Sydney),"Just got back from a trip from Dallas (DFW) to Sydney via Fiji Airways—my first time flying with them, and honestly, I was impressed, especially flying economy.

I bought my round-trip ticket just 2 days before departure for only $749, which was an absolute steal for a last-minute international flight.

Check-in at DFW was smooth. The only thing that stood out was the 4-hour layover in Fiji. The staff mentioned that if your layover is over 3 hours, they need to get immigration clearance or adjust you to an earlier connecting flight. Apparently, it’s because the Fiji airport is smaller and they try to manage congestion—which actually made sense.

In-flight experience:
	•	Big legroom in economy
	•	Food was surprisingly good (though could’ve been a bit warmer)
	•	Staff were friendly
	•	Overall very comfortable for a long-haul

Super happy with the experience, especially considering the last-minute fare. Would definitely fly Fiji Airways again!",9,1.0,4,2025-04-21 06:48:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k47543/first_time_flying_fiji_airways_surprisingly_great/,Remarkable_Carpet654

Basically I am thinking about travelling solo but I know it can be a lonely experience especially if not staying in a hostel.

Was it a group tour if so what kind and where? Or was it some kind of special activity you did? Or some kind of special hotel you stayed at? Please be specific and say where you went and what you did that helped you to make good friends. I'm hoping that these responses will help me to make friends while travelling solo.

travel,1jugoec,INDONESIA: Please help me find the dreamiest beach stay.,"Hi! I am planning a very last minute trip to Indonesia this month for my 35th birthday. I think we'll have a total of 9 days. I would like to do 4-5 nights in Bali and 4 nights somewhere super relaxing on the beach. From everything I've read Uluwatu seems like the best place for us to stay, we'll likely do a day trip to Ubud just to see it. It looks beautiful but I'm not sure it's worth staying. What do you think?

Is Uluwatu a good place to stay in Bali for a couple both in their mid 30s? We are looking for a good mix of party/relaxation for the first days.

I need the most help deciding on the latter half of this trip, I initially wanted to do the Maldives for 4 nights but getting there is so complicated I figured we could find a beautiful beach somewhere in Indonesia. This part of the trip is purely for relaxation, we want to do nothing but sit on a beautiful calm beach, go to the spa, and snorkel. I have looked into Gilli T, but haven't found any true luxury hotels. Not to be pretentious, we don't get to travel this far often so we're looking for a hotel that I won't stop thinking about when I get home to the US. I looked into the infamous Nihi hotel but $5000 a night is insanity so I'll just have to keep that on my wishlist for when i hit the lottery.  
  
Any and suggestions are welcome from food to activities! We are adventurous and will consider it all.  
We originally chose Indonesia because I wanted to swim with whale sharks, but I was ignorant to how truly widespread Indonesia is.

  
Thank you in advance!

In the past at Terminal A (and other international terminals) I've always had to go through security again before you get cleared back into the airport.

We are on a three-month sabbatical trip. Currently, we are close to finishing two weeks in Patagonia, which has been amazing. In about a week's time, we will arrive in Salta, but we are unsure how to continue our journey from there and would love some advice from travellers who have explored the area before.  

One thing we do know for sure is that we need to be in Cusco on day 16 or day 17 (in the morning) for the start of the Salkantay trek on day 19.  

### Some key info  
- High-paced travellers  
- Early 30s  
- Not a fan of night buses  
- Very diverse interests: nature, culture, food, small villages, but also big cities  
- After the itinerary below, we will continue to Puerto Maldonado (Amazon), Lima, Galapagos, Colombia  
- Flying is not an issue if it saves time  
- Good budget, but not unlimited  
- Heard road safety in Bolivia is not great, so trying to limit time in Bolivia  

### Questions  
1. In general, any recommendations based on the current draft itinerary? Places to add or skip?  
2. We are unsure whether to add Salar de Uyuni. Since we are also visiting Salinas Grandes, we wonder if it would be redundant  
3. How would you incorporate Salar de Uyuni? Which places would you skip or decrease the number of days in?  

### Our plan so far  
- Day 1: Arrive in Salta in the morning, pick up a car for self-drive and explore Salta
- Day 2: Stay at a ranch close to Salta  
- Day 3: Ranch → Tilcara  
- Day 4: Tilcara (Salinas Grandes, Humahuaca, Purmamarca)  
- Day 5: Tilcara (Salinas Grandes, Humahuaca, Purmamarca)  
- Day 6: Tilcara → Cachi  
- Day 7: Cachi → Cafayate  
- Day 8: Cafayate  
- Day 9: Cafayate → Salta  
- Day 10: Salta → San Pedro de Atacama (travel during the day)  
- Day 11: San Pedro de Atacama (tours)  
- Day 12: San Pedro (tours)  
- Day 13: San Pedro (entire day in San Pedro for tours, travel via Arica and Tacna to Arequipa at night)  
- Day 14: Arrive in Arequipa in the morning  
- Day 15: Arequipa  
- Day 16: Arequipa → Cusco (flight)  
- Day 17: Cusco (explore city)  
- Day 18: Cusco (Sacred Valley)  
- Day 19: Cusco (start Salkantay Trek). After the 4-day Salkantay trek, we will have one full day to explore Cusco",8,0.9,10,2025-04-11 12:47:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jwp0kt/help_us_out_with_our_itinerary_north_argentina/,Fabulous-Insect-6892

My wife and I (from Scandinavia) are planning a 30-day honeymoon adventure and would love advice from anyone who’s visited Mauritius, Réunion, and Seychelles in one go. We're drawn to wild nature, tropical islands, snorkeling, hiking, and spotting wildlife—but we also need to avoid places with Zika virus, yellow fever, or malaria, as we're currently trying to conceive.

We originally planned a dream route from Iquitos, Peru, through the Amazon to Manaus, Brazil (3 weeks in the jungle), ending with a week on Dominica. Unfortunately, that's no longer an option due to health risks.

Now we're considering spending a month split between Seychelles, Mauritius, and Réunion. We'd love to hear:

* Has anyone done this combo? Was it logistically manageable?
* Did it offer enough variety in nature, hiking, snorkeling, and wildlife?

We’re also actively looking for other destination ideas that meet these criteria:

* Tropical nature, beaches, hiking, snorkeling, jungle treks, wildlife
* No Zika, yellow fever, or malaria
* Feels somewhat off-the-beaten path or less touristy
* No need to rent a car – we don’t drive
* Budget: 6,700 EUR / 7,200 USD for two people including flights
* Prefer Airbnb or guesthouses over resorts
* Fine with traveling between two fairly distant places (e.g., Azores + Seychelles)

Some other places we’re considering:

* The Azores (Portugal)
* Okinawa (Japan)

I will be traveling to Copenhagen for the first time this October and am trying to figure out where the best place to stay would be.  I had thought to be closer to central Copenhagen, near the Indre By area, as there will be many things within walking distance. I would be open to stay further out if the transportation options are good though.  We will be traveling via public transit or taxi/Uber.  I would also be open to stay in either a hotel or Airbnb/rental, and would love any recommendations for that too.

Any info given would be greatly appreciated!

travel,1jthqwc,Travelling then vs. now,"Hey fellow travellers!

I have recently visited some of the few EU countries that I hadn’t yet been to, and I have mixed feelings about my experience.

Prague is a prime example of my biggest issue with modern-day tourism. First of all, don’t get me wrong: Prague is a beautiful city and definitely one of the highlights of my trip. However, it felt like the city had 10x the amount of tourists than it was originally designed to accommodate. 

Furthermore, the historical center felt like a movie set created for tourists. Chimney cake vendors, Thai Massage parlours, souvenir shops and neon-lit weed stores every few steps. It was difficult to find authentic local bakeries, shops or commerce catered to actual residents.

I realise that I’m no different than any of the other tourists in the city, but I feel like a lot of popular travel destinations worldwide are becoming copies of one another, losing a lot of their authenticity and original flair. Also, due to the crazy amount of tourists everywhere, it is sometimes really hard to enjoy a nice atmosphere due to having to shoulder your way through people on the sidewalks.

All this makes me wonder: How was travelling like before internet and online influencers? I’m in my early 30’s and perhaps would have had a much better time travelling 30, 40 or 50 years ago. 

Also, do you think things will only get worse in the future, or is travelling gonna go out of fashion eventually?",7,1.0,18,2025-04-07 10:09:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jthqwc/travelling_then_vs_now/,DundieAwardsWinner

travel,1jwnvrn,Crossing Albanian borders,"Hello travelers! 

I will soon visit North Macedonia for 12 days, and will get there by bus from Albania (Flixbus). 
I would like to know if they will scan my passeport at the border. 
The reason for this is that as a french guy, I am not allowed to stay more than 90 days in Albania. 
Going to North Macedonia saves me 10 full days of being in Albania, and therefore I will not exceed the limit of 90 days when I will fly back to France (from Albania). 
If my passport is not scanned at the border, then they will think I stayed too much in their country and I will get an expensive fine (~1000€), so I need to know if this would work.

travel,1jw45o5,Best Luggage Tracking for Android (Pixel 8 pro),"Soooo....finally experienced the horror that is lost luggage. While waiting on one of my two bags, I was approached by a friendly member of the airline's luggage team (I'd been waiting for 20+ minutes). She kindly informed me my luggage was left at the origin of my trip, and that I'd need to file a claim. OK, sh\*t. Fast forward, the bag wasn't lost, nor at another airport, it was in fact at the arrival airport; I received the bag the next morning.

All that to say: I need a good Android Luggage Tracker.

All my research has done nothing but lead to much confusion re: what is really best for Android users who travel frequently. I know there is no real Air Tag alternative, I understand Android Bluetooth trackers frequently lack accuracy, but I'd still like some real world advice on what works and what doesn't.",5,0.73,13,2025-04-10 17:53:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jw45o5/best_luggage_tracking_for_android_pixel_8_pro/,James_Odinson

travel,1ju706g,Is Late October or Late November a Better Time to Travel to Europe?,"Hi everyone!

My husband and I are planning our first trip to Europe and need some advice. We’re considering flying into Budapest (we have direct flights) and are trying to decide whether to visit Italy or Greece alongside Budapest. We’ve also heard that Portugal and Spain could be great options, but we’re concerned about spending too much time on travel, as we only have 9 days total.

# Details:

* Starting from: We’re coming from the Middle East and never been to Europe except Turkey.
* Travel dates: Late October (Oct 24-31) or Late November (Nov 22-28).
* Interests: We love exploring history, culture, food, and local landmarks. We’re particularly interested in ancient sites, museums, nature, and trying local cuisines. We’re not into hiking or outdoor activities, but we enjoy city walks and immersing ourselves in local life. We’re looking for a relaxed trip with plenty of time to enjoy the sights at a leisurely pace.

We’re wondering whether late October or late November would be a better time to visit Europe for sightseeing. We’ve heard mixed reviews about the weather, especially regarding November, and we want to avoid cold, rainy, or gloomy days as we’re not used to such weather. Also, would it be better to focus on **Budapest + Italy/Greece** or would Budapest + **Portugal/Spain** be a good option despite the potential travel time?

Edit: We would only be spending a day or 2 in Budapest. We are visiting the place coz we have direct flights to Budapest.

We've been to Tokyo and Kyoto a couple of times and absolutely loved them, both for the overall experience and for the surprisingly good vegetarian options we were able to find. Now, we're looking to explore other parts of Japan and were hoping to get some recommendations on the best/nicest cities to visit, specifically with vegetarian-friendly food in mind.

We know Japan isn't always the easiest place for vegetarians, especially outside of the major cities, but we're up for a bit of a challenge if the destination is worth it. Ideally, we're looking for places that have:

* A solid variety of vegetarian-friendly restaurants (not just one or two options)
* Interesting regional cuisine that can be adapted for vegetarians
* A great overall travel experience with scenery, culture, history, and walkability

We've been in Japan in November and April in previous years, but this time we found some great flight prices for December. We’re curious if that time of year impacts food options in any way or if there are any unique seasonal specialties worth trying.

We've heard that places like Osaka and Fukuoka might have some good vegetarian options, but we’re open to anywhere. Bonus points for any personal recommendations of specific restaurants or dishes to try!

My spouse and I enjoy active trips where we will (sometimes reluctantly) see the obligatory sites, but also love exploring and doing a bit more adventuring than most. For instance, we went to Belize and did a spear fishing excursion where we got to eat what we caught. 

We are looking between Ireland or Spain. I did some research and many do not compare these two places and the reason I am is simply because they are the cheapest tickets in the late September/early October window we would be traveling. I thought Ireland would be it hands down to see castles and drive the country, along with some incredible museums. But then as I was looking at Spain with all of its historical sites and landmarks, I am actually more partial to that now.

For Ireland we would fly in and out of Dublin, probably stay in 2-3 Airbnbs throughout the country to get around and see other places. Spain we would be flying into Barcelona and out of Madrid, probably staying in 1-2 spots in between those two.

travel,1k1me4b,Portugal Itinerary Advice: 7 Days,"This October my wife and I will be visiting Portugal for our 5 year anniversary. We are looking for a mostly relaxing, not overpacked trip as it’s our one week away from our preschool son (our parents are watching him during the trip).

We have already booked a flight to fly into Porto that arrives Sunday morning. We fly out the following Saturday morning.

We definitely want to do the Duoro valley and Porto.

I’m trying to decide between the following two itineraries 

Option 1:  4 nights in Duoro, 2 Nights in Porto. 

This could also be split up 3 and 3. Idea would be to stay at a couple different quintas (or splurge for a couple nights at the six senses resort. My big question here is if that is too much time in Duoro. We both like wine but aren’t obsessed.

Option 2: 2 nights in Duoro, 2 nights in Lisbon, 2 nights in Porto

Would spent the first couple days in Duoro, then catch the train to Lisbon spend a couple nights and catch and train back to Porto for the last two nights. Obviously this would allow us to see more but we wouldn’t want to be over-rushed.

Of note we would plan to rent a car for however long we are in Duoro then return it after.

Thoughts?

travel,1jzr1hr,Looking for some additional cities/counties to go to before I finish my Europe trip?,"In a few months time, I will be embarking on my first trip to Spain and Portugal. I (26 M) am solo travelling and then doing a contiki group tour and my itineary so far is as follows:

San Sebastian - 4 days solo traveliing (I'm a huge foodie and love going for beach walks - i think this is the perfect city to relax in before the group tour).  
Madrid - 2 days (I will spend a day and a half here before beginning my group tour) Cordoba - One night as part of group tour Seville- 2 days (as part of group tour)  
Portugal - 6 days (Lisbon, Porto and Algrave)  
Salamanca - 1 day  
Madrid - end group tour and explore more of madrid for 3 days doing solo travelling.

I will probably do a lot of bus travelling and partying as part of my group tour, so i'm looking for potentially finding a city that is more relaxing. I'm also conscious of not getting too overwhelmed with all the travelling since it is my first time in Europe.

After the Spain and Portugal portion, I'm trying to figure out where to go next before I fly home. I'm thinking of either doing London, Como or Bern (3 very different locations I know). However, I think only doing Como without exploring more of Italy would feel too short. Bern looks cool because there’s a nice lake to swim in and it would be interesting to get a glimpse of everyday life in Switzerland, and London just feels like a cool city to visit overall—big, lively, and very different from the rest of my itinerary so far.

That being said, I’m looking for suggestions for additional places that might be a good contrast to everything I’m already doing. Somewhere a bit more chill would be ideal—bonus points if it's near nature (mountains/lakes/ocean), has good food, and doesn’t require a crazy amount of travel from Spain or Portugal. I’m trying to avoid burning out with too many flights or overly packed travel days.

Also, since I’ll be solo traveling again after the group tour ends, I’d love to go somewhere that’s solo-travel-friendly and safe—somewhere that doesn’t feel too isolating and where there’s a good chance to meet other travelers or locals. Whether it’s a social hostel scene (ideally I would like to stay in a hotel thought), walking tours, or just a generally friendly vibe, I’d really appreciate any advice on cities that fit that.

Would love to hear any thoughts or personal recommendations—especially if anyone has done a similar route or solo traveled in these places.

travel,1jykb2f,Towns/cities with unique/preserved urban architecture styles?,"I am interested in towns that have been able to preserve unique urban architecture styles (that generally predate the 1800's). It seems that in most places, once industrialization took hold the local architecture style was ditched for a more uniform western style (whether due to colonization or western hegemony).

I am not interested in places that only have 1 or 2 buildings with a given style (such as a cathedral or palace), but places with a very high saturation of these buildings. 

As an example, [Berat](https://imgur.com/a/berat-PJsF2SG) and [Gjirokastre](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.0741952,20.1385301,3a,75y,145.42h,97.5t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1stZxBo7zvclJLjkeyV_NFaQ!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D-7.504916289099654%26panoid%3DtZxBo7zvclJLjkeyV_NFaQ%26yaw%3D145.4228274316431!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDQwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) in Albania have preserved 16th century ottoman architecture very well. While this style can be found in small pockets throughout the Balkans, there is nothing at the saturation of these two. I was able to visit these places over the summer and I found them fascinating

Other examples:

[La Alberca, Spain](https://imgur.com/a/D0RGsq2)

[Srinigar, India](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Wo8xx8xADRVLpMXg9)

[Foroglia, Switzerland](https://imgur.com/a/JEWzdrl)

[Sana'a, Yemen](https://imgur.com/a/COGfs8J)

I guess the goal is to find places that still seem representative of the way they were 200+ years ago in terms of architecture (so I can visit + wander around them :). This is easy enough in Europe, but when trying to find examples in Asia or Africa it becomes much harder. Even within Europe, trying to find examples of pre-industrial architecture is a challenge.

travel,1jw9cre,11 Days in Europe,"Hi everyone,

I’d really appreciate some help making a travel decision! In June, I’ll be spending 14 days in Spain (Barcelona, Madrid, Toledo, Granada, and Seville)—that portion of the trip is already planned and booked. After that, I’ll have 11 unscheduled days before I return to work, and I’d love to spend them exploring somewhere else in Europe, but I’m torn on where to go.

I’ll be traveling with my mom during those 11 days. In the past, we’ve visited England, Italy, Greece, Spain, and France, so we’re hoping to experience somewhere new. We tend to travel at a fairly fast pace—we enjoy having full days—but we also prefer spending an extended amount of time in one country, rather than hopping around too much.

One option we’re considering is Portugal. We were thinking something like 3 days in Porto, 3 in Lisbon (with a day trip to Sintra), and 3 in the Douro Valley (we’d love to do the Paiva Walkways). Our only hesitation is that we might feel like we’re missing out by not making it down to the Algarve.

Another idea was a mix of Amsterdam, Vienna, and Prague. We both love great food, art museums (the Picasso Museum in Paris is my all-time favorite), walking through cities, and a bit of nature as well.

With that in mind, do you have any thoughts on Portugal vs. the Amsterdam/Vienna/Prague route—or any other recommendations that might fit the bill? We’re hoping to keep the budget around $4,000 total (not including flights).

travel,1jw5m04,Quick trip to Bali. (Trip report),"I’m sure Bali has been covered 1 million times but here is a quick 9 night trip report.

 

40 Male- 40 Female couple USA/NYC

 

We flew Singapore Airlines from JFK-SIN-DPS. My first time on Singapore airlines.  We booked “Premium Economy” exit row. What we didn’t realize is that on this flight there is no Economy class. Only First, Business and premium economy. So essentially if you are Premium economy you are in Economy class. Regardless, the seats were comfortable enough, and the food was impressive. The exit row provided unlimited leg room, making it easy to stand up to stretch or use the facilities.

 

We arrived at DPS around 11am and our hotel provided free pickup from the airport.

We met our driver and headed to Ubud. We stayed at Ubud village hotel. The Hotel was on the main drag right in the middle of town. However once inside, the chaos of the main street was nonexistent. The property was very quiet and serene. We had a room facing the pool. The room was very clean and spacious with a very large balcony. The pool area was also very nice, with comfortable loungers and friendly staff offering towels. The pool area also had a bar with happy hour specials.

On our arrival day we just walked around town for a bit and had an early dinner. We went to sleep early from the jetlag.

Day 2 we woke up early, went to a local coffee shop and had a light breakfast. Next, we walked down the road to the monkey forest. We spent a few hours there walking around and taking in the scenery. Afterwards we walked up to Ubud palace and Ubud water temple. Had lunch and visited the market.

 

 

Day 3 we hired a driver using Get your guide. Our driver picked us up at 8am. We headed to 3 different waterfalls, the famous water temple, rice terrace and a coffee plantation. The guide was great, and I highly recommend using get your guide to arrange a private tour.

 

Day 4 we arranged a ride with our hotel to take us to our next location, Sanur beach.

In Sanur we stayed at Hotel 101. Another great stay. We had a room on the first level with direct access to the pool. There are two pools at this hotel, I would recommend trying to have a room near the pool in the rear.  The front pool seemed a bit overcrowded and noisy.

Sanur overall was a good fit for us, it has an older more laidback crowd. But still, lots to see and do. We checked out an Irish pub that had live music (the wicked parrot).

Day 5 we just walked around town and visited some shops and the beach, nothing important to mention.

Day 6 we used Grab for a ride the Sanur harbor. We used Setia ferry to take us to Nusa Lembongon. The ferry was great, and the boarding process was very organized.

Once on Nusa Lembongon we stayed at Lembongon Summer hotel. The hotel is made up of 4 private bungalows. Each with a mini plunge pool. We were very impressed with how nice this stay was. It was close to the main road but far enough back to be quiet and peaceful.   On NL there are no cars. Only motor bikes and mini pickup trucks (taxis). We opted to not rent motor bikes and instead use the taxis or walk.  

Day 7 we arranged a SCUBA diving trip with Legend divers, and it was a great day. We went to manta point and got to dive with giant manta rays.

Day 8 we took a taxi to dream beach and spent the day at D’bayus beach club. It was a small beach bar that served light food and was playing some great music. Very relaxing day.

 

Three restaurants to mention on NL.  Little Prema BBQ for fresh grilled fish, Lemongrass for pizza and cocktails and Curry traders for Indian and cocktails.

 

Day 9 we headed back to the mainland and arranged a ride using Klook. Our driver met us in the ferry arrivals area and easily took us to Kuta to our hotel Grandmas Plus Hotel Legian. The hotel was fine for one night, no complaints. It is right in the middle of town, so plenty to do. We got some small tattoos at Rose tattoo Bali. Good clean shop with treasonable prices. Both tattoos came out nice.  Later, we walked over to the beach and hung out at one of the beach bars for sunset.  

 

Final day we once again used Klook for a 4am pick up to take us to the airport. The driver was there on time and got us to the airport without any issues. 

 

To wrap it all up, this was my first time to Bali, and I was a bit apprehensive at first. I usually try to avoid visiting overly touristic places.  However, I really enjoyed our quick trip and would defiantly like to return for a longer visit.

travel,1julklu,been having really good luck with international upgrades!,"I just flew between Miami and Frankfurt, and got upgraded to business class on both flights using the bidding system. The flight there was booked on Condor and I originally paid 295 for an economy light ticket without any extras because I wanted to test out the seat boost app. The flight back was on Lufthansa in Premium Economy that I booked for 53,000 miles and more points +$135 in surcharges. I used the seat boost for the condor flight and was the only one on the bidding list, so my bid was accepted at the opening bid price of $595. The upgrade at the check-in desk was priced at $999 and the ticket was priced at around $4,000 the day of departure. For my Lufthansa flight I also put in a bid at the lowest possible bid of $575 which was accepted 2 days before the flight. I've never had an upgrade on Lufthansa be accepted so I was really surprised. Maybe it's due to the fact that less Europeans are flying to the U.S nowadays, but whatever the reason it seems to be working in my favor for half off upgrades. ",5,0.78,2,2025-04-08 19:00:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1julklu/been_having_really_good_luck_with_international/,UA787MIA

I am currently planning my trip to Suriname and Guyana and as you all probably know, there is very little information out there about these countries. 
I wanna go overland from Brazil to French Guiana, Suriname and finally Guyana and unfortunately Guyana is the only one that requires visa for (some) EU citizens (I am Czech). On top of that, my country does not have Guyanese embassy and even if it did, I am currently in Colombia so it wouldn’t help me anyway. 

From official government website it seems that for countries like mine with no options to obtain visa home, you can get visa on arrival but one of the requirements is an invitation letter of your host and I am not sure if an airbnb host or a hotel would be enough?

I’ve also found few reports from travelers that you can basicly just show up at the border and get a stamp but lot of these reports are pretty outdated and since this part of the world is pretty remote and not easily accesible, I wanna make sure I come prepared, especially because my flight back to Colombia would be from Georgetown.

travel,1jotup8,EWR Customs Experience?,"TLDR: affirming a light/non-existent Customs check at EWR from EU

Wanting to validate if anyone had the same customs experience we did at EWR from Italy with an overnight stay in Copenhagen. It was our first time flying international via EWR (vs we typically fly from JFK). We each had a checked bag while I have Global Entry and my husband does not (not sure if that makes any difference) with us in the same booking.

We breezed through Passport Control in Terminal B, claimed our bags and passed a single Xray machine where it appeared people were only being stopped randomly. We didn’t get stopped but hesitated and tried to ask but the guys working the xray line weren’t paying attention/stopping anyone other than the 1 guy they were dealing with. Otherwise, we (and many people before and around us) just took our bags and moved forward expecting another customs checkpoint but were suddenly outside the airport!

travel,1jni920,Which Swedish cities to prioritize from Copenhagen?,"Hello! We are traveling to Copenhagen from Canada in the summer and trying to strike the right balance of sightseeing and a somewhat relaxed pace in a limited amount of time. We are happy to travel by train to Sweden, but looking to minimize travel time where possible. Note: we must return to Denmark as we fly out from CPH on Day 10.

What would make for the most fulfilling trip over the course of 9 days that would give us a decent enough vibe of each area? Ideal criteria is walkability, old city charm, beautiful architecture, cozy cafes, and diverse vegetarian-friendly restaurant options.

Please see below. Thoughts on which option may be best as newbies to Scandinavian culture? We are also open to other suggestions and tips on how to optimize scheduling based on what each city has to offer.

1) Copenhagen (2 days) -Elsinore/Helsingborg (1.5 days) - Gothenburg (3 days) - Copenhagen (2.5 days)

2) Copenhagen (2 days) -  Elsinore/Helsingborg (1.5 days) - Copenhagen - Stockholm (3.5 days)  - Copenhagen (2 days)

travel,1jkqvnh,2 week trip to india - changed hotel booking after getting the Visa. Is it a problem?,"Hi! 
I am traveling to india in 6 days, already got my Visa in order and everything. 
Only problem is, in the Visa, they asked me to put an address for a hotel i booked or the address of someone I'm staying at. I put there a hostel reservation I had booked beforehand, in shimla. I got my Visa but then changed my mind and cancelled the booking because I wanted to go to rishikesh instead. I cancelled the hostel in shimla, and booked one in rishikesh. 

My question is, will I get in any trouble for this at the customs when arriving? Is there any chance that they'll ask ne where I'm staying, or something similar? And if I say that I'm staying in rishikesh, but they see on the Visa that I put shimla, will this be a problem? 

Or, if I say I'm going to Shimla, to not get in any trouble, will they ask me for a booking confirmation? (Which I don't have since I cancelled my booking).

travel,1k4j6bm,April: Sicily or Mexico,"Good evening team. My kids are getting old enough now to travel a little more adventurously.

Due to the nature of my job it's often necessary to plan holidays a year in advance, so we're already looking at next year's Easter holidays.

Two options we are considering are Sicily and Mexico.

If Mexico, we would consider 7-8 days in Mexico City and plan trips, sight seeing and excursions (ideally with cooking/proper local food experiences), followed by an internal flight and then 4-5 days in Cancun to visit Chichen Itza, and spend some time by the sea or at a resort to fully relax for a couple of days before flying home.

If Sicily we would rent a car (we are used to driving in South Italy, Greece, etc - we know what the roads and drivers can be like) and plan something more of a tour around and stay in smaller villas and B&Bs in villages, towns, to see a lot more of the incredible island.

Two very different trips, but both would provide a mixture of (varying) exploration and relaxation. They both seem to be a good step up from our previous holidays when the kids were littler towards the more rough and ready travel my wife and I were used to (kids will be 10 and 8 by next spring).

(My wife has decent Spanish, I have lower-intermediate Italian - but I know that may not necessarily translate all over Sicily)

So, for people that have been to either or both - what were your experiences of these sorts of itineraries at that time of year? Are there better plans for family trips in those areas?

3. Schedule it so I can pop the question on October 11th (our anniversary)

Ultimately, this resort idea was inspired by an ASMR series on YouTube from the creator Goodnight Moon. Every fall she posts a new video featuring a roleplay of a hotel check in at her recently dubbed ""Mahogany Lodge"" where she goes over all sorts of fall themed activities and scenery to enjoy at this fictional location. Basically, I'm trying to find this sort of place. One that actually exists lol. If any of your guys know of such a location, please let me know! I'd greatly appreciate your help.

travel,1jzrq7x,Solo travelling Europe at 16,"TLDR: My experience solo travelling Europe at 16 coming from New Zealand and the planning side of things. Traveled through London, Barcelona, Andorra, Warsaw, Budapest, Berlin, Munich, Prague, and Istanbul. Encountered no major safety issues and met lots of nice people through hostels and walking tours. Hoping to inspire others under 18 who want to travel independently.

This is for all those under 18 who want to travel but don't know how. I'm about to turn 17 and i'm planning a solo trip around east Asia, but I first wanted to talk about my solo trip to Europe. I'm from New Zealand and had always loved travelling, at 15 I went on an exchange year to California, USA, and whilst there I had met a couple of other exchange students from Europe. A year later, I wanted to go explore, so after the school year finished, I compiled all my money (from my part time job and extra savings), I had around $7000NZD and started booking flights and hotels.

At first, I did some googling to find where I could stay as most places would not let minors check in to hotels - flying alone was fine as I had flown numerous times alone. I was on reddit (there wasn't a lot of info about this, so i'm hoping this post will help others), but I found out YHA London had a ton of hostels throughout London that would allow minors to check in, so I booked 2 nights there (YHA Oxford St). This made me realise that there were DEFINITELY hostels/hotels out there that would allow minors to check in. And so my trip began...

I flew 13 hours from AKL to LAX, (as I said before I had previously lived in Cali for a bit so LA was pretty familiar to me), I had a LONG layover so I left the airport, went to Grand Central Market for some lunch, then took a train (LA public transport is really not that bad) to meet some friends and then went back to the airport, had a nap, and slept for the next 12 hours on the flight to London. I arrived in London in the evening, went straight to the hostel and checked in and continued to sleep until the morning. After 2 days (definitely not enough) in London, seeing all the sights, I hopped on a flight to Barcelona which was a very last minute decision, I had literally changed my itinerary a week before, as I wanted to go snowboarding in Andorra. Anyway, when I got to Barcelona in the evening, I was confused on where to meet my bus. I was stressed and waiting along time when finally my bus came and it was 3 more hours to Andorra le Vella. Booking a hotel here was a nightmare, I think I must've called every single hotel in the city or looked through their FAQs to see whether a minor was allowed to check in, but I found ONE (im sorry I forgot the name, it's a local owned one). After snowboarding in Andorra, I went back to Barcelona, spent the day there, and then went back to the airport to Warsaw, Poland.

In Warsaw, I stayed at the Kapsula Hotel (a capsule hotel), they allowed minors to stay here on the condition of a signed consent form from parents. This was also by far the cheapest hostel I found ($18NZD a night) and it was really clean and pretty spacious considering it was a capsule. After Warsaw, I flew to Budapest and stayed at the Maverick City Lodge in the Jewish Quarter which also needed a consent form to stay here. There's a lot of good nightlife and food around this area. I then flew to Berlin where I stayed at the MEININGER hotel in Alexanderplatz (this is a hotel chain all around Europe), where they also required a consent form. The hotel was right next door to one of the subway stops which went straight to the city centre which was a bonus. I then flew to Munich and stayed at A&O hostels, which is also a hotel chain all around Europe, that allowed minors to stay there with a consent form (up to 14 years old! Whereas the rest you had to be 16). Then I took the earliest train to Prague and spent the entire day walking around the Old Town, going to museums etc.

And finally flew to Istanbul, Turkey (was upgraded free to first class!). I was here for what was supposed to be a 1 hour layover but was delayed to over 7 hours. I had landed in Istanbul at exactly midnight and had no idea what to do. So, as someone who wanted to explore, I left the airport in the middle of the night and googled what to see in Istanbul and took a taxi all the way to the Hagia Sophia Grand Mosque. I was genuinely so tired and half way through the one hour taxi ride, I asked the taxi driver if we could turn back to the airport (I had seen that the airport had sleeping pods), BUT the taxi driver insisted I go see the mosque. He was a really nice guy, he actually made a couple of stops on the way at some other landmarks and offered to take some photos for me, which I'm so grateful for. Then eventually, went back to the airport, I had walked all over the Istanbul airport (it's really big) and every sleeping pod was booked, every lounge chair was taken, so I ended up sleeping on the floor. Then over 24 hours later, I was back in my own bed in New Zealand.

I had previously been to Italy and Croatia with my family so I was generally aware of the tourism culture in Europe. There was at no point during the entire trip did I feel unsafe, in fact the most unsafe I felt was walking in downtown LA. I tried booking private rooms whenever I could. I did go out almost every night to experienced the nightlife...and was mostly let in. I met a ton of amazing people on walking tours and in the hostels, I also met up with a couple of friends in each city. All in all, it was a great time and I will definitely be back.",5,0.6,7,2025-04-15 13:20:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jzrq7x/solo_travelling_europe_at_16/,Public-Guest7512
travel,1jzbus5,Is my Inca Rail itinerary too risky for a same-day Machu Picchu entry?,"Hi everyone,

I bought an all-inclusive Inca Rail ticket for June (Sunday) and didn't think much of it, assuming they'd only sell a safe itinerary. Here's the schedule:

09:55 — Depart Cusco by bus

12:00 — Arrive at train station

12:30 — Train departs

14:00 — Bus to Citadel (I heard queues are shorter around this time)

14:40 — Arrive at Machu Picchu

15:00 — My entry time (20 min buffer)


Inca Rail assured me it’s fine, and mentioned there’s actually a 40-minute grace period for late entry. Still, I’ve seen reviews where the train was delayed by hours — and that makes me nervous.

I’m thinking of switching to an earlier train at 08:30, but:   
- I’m traveling with a senior, and the extra 1.5h helps them rest (especially with other tiring days ahead)
- The 08:30 train is lower class — refund and change would be a hassle
- I’ll miss the better food and comfort of the nicer train
- I’d rather avoid dealing with bureaucracy unless absolutely necessary


We also don’t want to do a two-day trip, so going the day before isn’t an option.

In short: I prefer to keep my current plan, but I’m worried it’s cutting it too close. Has anyone had issues with delays on this route?

Thanks!

travel,1jz8a3r,2 week trip in April to Poland: Help deciding which cities (and in what order) should I visit?,"Hi all,
First time heading to Poland, 2 weeks total! My beginning city will be Warsaw and then my end city will be Krakow. I already booked the flights and can’t change it. But beyond the end points, the rest hasn’t been decided yet. But I have two weeks to see a few unique cities and would love to get some advice as to which cities to choose. 

I was thinking Warsaw -> Gdansk -> Wroclaw -> Krakow? Open to less or more or different ones, so long as Warsaw is the beginning and Krakow is the end.

Some things about how I like to travel:
- I’m usually a “wing it” type of traveler but I do want a general idea of which cities to visit. As far as how long I stay in each city, I base it according to how I feel!
- Will be solo and will be carrying city clothes/shoes (this is just part of a longer European trip). Prefer the party hostels.
- I do love nature but due to lack of proper shoes, it would have to be more of a stroll
- I like artsy stuff, thrifting, morbid museums, local food, places that don’t emit too much of a “Disneyland for tourists” vibe
- Will do some touristy stuff but don’t care to visit EVERY single museum or attraction
- Prefer a slower pace travel. Am okay with staying 4-5 days in a city as long as there’s nice places to stroll around and to just sit and people watch. Beautiful greenery/scenic views are a plus.
- will be traveling within the country via train

Any recs as to which cities to visit and the order of the cities I should go to?",5,1.0,7,2025-04-14 19:54:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jz8a3r/2_week_trip_in_april_to_poland_help_deciding/,EnigmaticEarthling
travel,1jyyzqd,Anyone understand Virgin Australia Gold's baggage benefit on Etihad?,"This one's been doing my head in, trying to work out what I can take checked in with an economy comfort ticket.


- Etihad doesn't document it anywhere
- Virgin documents it here https://www.velocityfrequentflyer.com/flying-status/flying-with-status/gold-membership#20 as ""up to 15kg"" additional 
- My ticket says 30kg, but that might be the entry level Economy Comfort allowance (seems both a bit generous w/o status, and a bit small to include aforementioned up to 15kg??) or it might be including my VA status...
- Etihad support via messaging don't seem to want to say, other than to ask Virgin... Not convinced they understand what I'm asking
- I asked on another leg and the check in staff said I needed to ""choose my luggage benefit online"" which maybe sounds like an Etihad Guest thing (I'm not part of that program so can't login to their FF portal... Right??). Upon reflection, should have pushed for a better answer then...

is vancouver a good vacation spot? if there are other preferred recommendations, whats a good vacation spot in canada?

lastly, what are some recommendations to do in canada? its such a big country, so its hard to choose vs a domestic vacation.

travel,1jxmvry,"Visiting Czechia, I would appreciate some feedback on my itinerary","Hello everyone! I'm going to Czechia in November and would love some opinions on my itinerary. My main interests are astronomy, nature/hiking, and history (esp.1500-1700s). I don't usually do this many tours but there are many good ones that seem to fit perfectly with my tastes, so it's a bit full on that end. Also worth noting, I wake up every day at like 6am, so I'll be starting my days early. I don't tend to stay up late. Here goes:

- **DAY 1**: ARRIVE airport 9:50am. PRAGA - Old town walk around (Astronomical Clock, Stone Lamb house of astronomer Hájek, Hanging Freud, Bethlehem Chapel, tomb of astronomer Tycho Brahe, Mozart house, Café Louvre, etc.), Praga Bunker tour (14:45-17:15). *Sleep Praga station area*

- **DAY 2**: Start early, Hrubá Skála walk, maybe Prachov Cliffs. -- Still figuring out how to do this day trip by public transport. After, head up to Hřensko. *Sleep Hřensko*

- **DAYS 3-4**: Bohemian Switzerland National Park: Děčín, Hřensko, Pravčická Archway, boat ride, Neurathen Castle... Haven't decided on exact trails yet, but I think a couple days would be good. Return to Praga day 4, Plague Tour starts at 20h, sleep old town.

- **DAY 5**: Early train to Karlštejn. Walk around town. Start tour at the castle 10am. Return to Praga after, National Museum if time, opera/classical concert (Dvořák or Figaro, depends on schedule) starts 19h. *Sleep Praga old town*

- **DAYS 6-7**: Karlovy Vary area, Loket Castle, maybe Marianske Lazne, Národní přírodní rezervace SOOS and/or Cheb. *Sleep Karlovy Vary*

- **DAY 8**: PRAGA - Early morning return to Prague. Be at National Technical Museum at opening time, full day in the museum (probably won't take more than a few hours but it's a priority of my trip due to the large astronomy exhibit, so want to give it breathing room; I went to the Tech museum in Berlin which is very similar and regretted not spending more time there). Afternoon: Speculum Alchemiae if I feel like it, Jewish Cemetery, walk around. Medieval Underground Tour begins 18:45h. *Sleep castle area*

- **DAY 9**: Nový Svět, Tycho Brahe & Kepler statue, Kafka house, Golden Lane, see castle from outside. Whatever I have time for. Flight leaves at 15:15h.

I know I've split my Prague days up. This is because I generally don't like cities much and I'm pretty sure I'll go a bit mad if I'm in Prague too many days/nights in a row, and this way I can try sleeping in a few different areas too.

travel,1jwvhrq,Flight Protection?,"I'm sure this question has been asked many times here, but I'm asking this for my girlfriend. I just bought the cheapest flight ticket i could find for her going from Hong Kong to Minnesota. I'm wondering whether flight protection is even worth it. We have no intentions on canceling or changing the flight at all. She is still young and has no serious medical conditions. Even if any of her flights are delayed, most airlines will try to avoid the time threshold the policy requires for any reimbursement. It seems that most people who get flight protection are those who have medical concerns, travel a lot, or are really worried about extreme delays and other unlikely events. I have friends who travel (domestically and internationally) often and say they always deny any insurance and have had no problems with their trips. I guess protection is really meant for worst case scenarios, or if you're not someone who doesn't have health concerns and doesn't travel often, or if you are someone who wants the extra peace of mind?

I of course would like my girlfriend to be safe, as well as my money, but I can't imagine anything other than extreme cases that would really necessitate getting insurance for a flight. I'd like to hear different opinions on this topic.

It might sound counterintuitive but I'm a Mexican guy asking to foreigners about places in Mexico to visit but I have some days off and I want to solo travel somewhere near in the south. I'm not well traveled specially not solo, so I want to hear your recommendations for the South of Mexico. 

I'm looking for a place I can get to in a day by plane or bus, (I'm located I'm in the state of Tabasco), a place with vibrant nightlife with people from different countries. I'm more into house/dance music, so having places where I could dance to it would be nice. I'm not really into cultural stuff, I've seen them tons of time since I was a kid, so I'm looking more to connect with people.

Places that come into my mind are san Cristobal de las casas, but I already went there like two months ago, PDC or Tulum also come into my mind but I don't know how easy is to meet people there, it seems like many people go there in groups of friends not really looking to meet people so I wouldn't like to spend a small fortune to go sit in a beach listening to music and watching memes. Oaxaca is another place that comes to my mind but I've never gone there so I don't know what to expect, the same with Campeche, I know it has some Caribbean like beaches but I've never tourist there and it's not a major tourist spot so I don't know how good of a plan would be. 

I recently went to Rio and I really liked the vibe there, specially in pedra do sal where everybody is drinking in a public space, there's music, people was singing along, and I met a lot of people from many countries specially Argentinians and I would like to re live something similar here in Mexico but I don't really know what could be the closest place to replicate something like that.

travel,1jqtznn,Puerto Rico travel,"For those traveling from the US it is a simple process to get to and from the island. All you need is a real ID. I would suggest you take a couple hundred in cash as taxi drivers don't always take cash. The streets especially in the towns are poorly marked even if you are comfortable with Spanish. You might want to load the app that converts English/Spanish as many menus are in Spanish. My sister and I stayed in San Juan, but it did not feel to be the safest of places with bars on windows and doors. We got out and walked in our area but felt we had to be back to the apartment before dark.
One of the places we were hoping to see was their Bioluminescent Bay. Unfortunately we got our VRBO in San Juan. The taxi fare to the ferry and back from San Juan would have cost us $190, then take the ferry over to the small island, then an extra $40 from the ferry to the bay. Then you have the cost of the adventure itself at about $150. These glass bottom kayaks are taken out at night and when the water is stirred with your paddles the small sealife glow. The problem was we would take the last ferry off the island back to PR and wouldn't get to the landing until at least 10:30 and it is not well lit and the taxi ride back to San Juan is another 1 1/2 hours. Needless to say we didn't go. However, if I had known that most people book a night or to on Vieques Island first and get a hotel or whatever there and then the next day head off to PR.  
Lastly, old San Juan is beautiful and has a rich history and nice shops. If your taking at trip to Puerto Rico, just stay in the Old San Juan part of town. Trust me it is worth it.
Hope this helps anyone making the trip.",4,0.7,2,2025-04-03 20:55:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jqtznn/puerto_rico_travel/,PT4ever84
