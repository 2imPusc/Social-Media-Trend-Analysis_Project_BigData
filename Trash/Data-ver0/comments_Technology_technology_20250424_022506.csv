In 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to eight counts including campaign-finance violations, tax fraud, and bank fraud. Cohen said he violated campaign-finance laws at Trump’s direction “for the principal purpose of influencing” the 2016 presidential election.

In his testimony, he warned Republicans he lost everything by following Trump’s demands, acting at his bequest. “So to those who support the president and his rhetoric as I once did, I pray the country doesn’t make the same mistakes that I have made or pay the heavy price that my family and I are paying.”

*[...] Xiaofeng Wang has a long list of prestigious titles. He was the associate dean for research at Indiana University's Luddy School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering, a fellow at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and a tenured professor at Indiana University at Bloomington. According to his employer, he has served as principal investigator on research projects totaling nearly $23 million over his 21 years there.*

*He has also co-authored scores of academic papers on a diverse range of research fields, including cryptography, systems security, and data privacy, including the protection of human genomic data. I have personally spoken to him on three occasions for articles here, here, and here.*

*In recent weeks, Wang's email account, phone number, and profile page at the Luddy School were quietly erased by his employer. Over the same time, Indiana University also removed a profile for his wife, Nianli Ma, who was listed as a Lead Systems Analyst and Programmer at the university's Library Technologies division.*

*According to the Herald-Times in Bloomington, a small fleet of unmarked cars driven by government agents descended on the Bloomington home of Wang and Ma on Friday. They spent most of the day going in and out of the house and occasionally transferred boxes from their vehicles.*

They are approved by a single judge who is pre-appointed to FISC to have security clearance by the Chief Justice alone.

According to a post by a user named ThinkingOne, the leak is the result of a disgruntled X employee who allegedly stole the data during a period of mass layoffs.*

*[This data leak] doesn’t contain email addresses, but it does hold a goldmine of profile metadata, including:*

*• Account creation dates.*

*• User IDs and screen names.*

*• Profile descriptions and URLs.*

*• Location and time zone settings.*

*• Display names (current and from 2021).*

*• Followers count from both 2021 and 2025.*

*• Tweet count and timestamps of the last tweet.*

*• Friends count, listed count, and favorites count.*

*• Source of the last tweet (such as TweetDeck or X Web App).*

*• Status settings (like whether the profile is verified or protected).*

*[...] As of Jan 2025, X (formerly Twitter) had around 335.7 million users, so how is it possible that data from 2.8 billion users has been leaked? One possible explanation is that the dataset includes aggregated or historical data, such as bot accounts that were created and later banned, inactive or deleted accounts that still lingered in historical records, or old data that was merged with newer data, increasing the total number of records.*

*Additionally, some entries might not even represent real users but could include non-user entities like API accounts, developer bots, deleted or banned profiles that remained logged somewhere, or organization and brand accounts that aren’t tied to individual users.*",2656,2025-04-01 08:49:02,marketrent

technology,1k0u19p,mngudz0,"Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced on April 16 the closure of the State Department’s office responsible for countering foreign disinformation, citing concerns about free speech and the rights of American citizens.

The office started as part of the U.S. government’s efforts to fight terrorist messaging online. It was first called the Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications. In 2016, it changed its focus to fighting lies and propaganda from foreign governments like Russia and China, and got a new name — the Global Engagement Center (GEC).

In December 2024, the GEC was reorganized into the State Department’s Counter Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference Hub (R/FIMI).

“I am announcing the closure of the State Department’s Counter Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference, formerly the Global Engagement Center (GEC), which cost taxpayers more than $50 million per year and actively silenced and censored the voices of Americans they were supposed to be serving,” Rubio wrote.

The move follows years of Republican criticism of the center. Billionaire Elon Musk, now an advisor to  U.S. President Donald Trump and head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), in early 2023 called the GEC “the worst offender in U.S. government censorship (and) media manipulation.”

GEC leaders and defenders have rejected such claims. Special Envoy James Rubin, who led the center until its shutdown, said its mission was focused exclusively on foreign disinformation campaigns. The center ran projects in Latin America, Africa, and Moldova during his time in the office.

  
One project focused on a major Russian disinformation campaign in Africa called the “African Initiative,” which aimed at undermining trust in a U.S.-funded health program in the region. Russia recruited journalists, bloggers, and public figures to spread conspiracy theories across social media, websites, and Telegram channels.

“Many, many thousands, if not more, of people might have believed (the disinformation) and not received life-saving medical care,” had the campaign not been noticed sooner, Rubin told Politico in October 2024.",352,2025-04-16 20:07:49,Wagamaga

technology,1k40khq,mo6h706,"From the article: US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly shared details about the March 15th Yemen military strikes in another Signal chat with people who weren’t government officials, reports The New York Times. The chat included his wife and “about a dozen” others he knew personally and professionally, the outlet writes, citing conversations with four unnamed sources.

The details he shared “included the flight schedules for the F/A-18 Hornets targeting the Houthis in Yemen,” writes the Times, which notes the details were “essentially the same” as those shared in the Signal chat between Hegseth and other officials last month that included Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg, who was added by mistake.

But in this case, according to the Times, the chat was one that Hegseth made in January before he was Defense Secretary:

*Unlike the chat in which The Atlantic was mistakenly included, the newly revealed one was created by Mr. Hegseth. It included his wife and about a dozen other people from his personal and professional inner circle in January, before his confirmation as defense secretary, and was named “Defense | Team Huddle,” the people familiar with the chat said. He used his private phone, rather than his government one, to access the Signal chat.*

The outlet’s sources told it that “Hegseth typically did not use the chat to discuss sensitive military operations and said it did not include other cabinet-level officials.” According to the Times, a US official confirmed the “informal group chat” but insisted no classified information had ever been discussed on it. The unnamed official wouldn’t comment on whether Hegseth “shared detail targeting information,” the story says.",131,2025-04-21 00:39:02,chrisdh79

* Company financials and future growth strategy
* Corporate governance
* Risks and issues both internal and external
* Lots of stuff on tech readiness, vulnerabilities and the like.

As part of preparing the United States Armed Forces for potential confrontation in the Pacific region, the Pentagon is encountering new challenges related to the mass production of drones.


Primarily, this concerns components, a significant portion of which are manufactured in China and supplied to the U.S. both directly and through intermediary supply chains.

  
China currently controls close to 90 percent of the global commercial drone market, according to market research firm Drone Industry Insights UG.

Additionally, it is in China where key drone components are produced, such as airframes, batteries, radios, cameras, and screens. Due to mass production and availability, these components are highly competitive, making it difficult to create an effective alternative at the moment.

In 2007 he argued before the Supreme Court that there was no right to sex toys, to sexual gratification, and that the state had a legitimate interest in regulating aids to masturbation.

The law still stands and prohibits owning more than six dildos. Why six? I have no clue, but that's the legal limit in Texas.

And just last year the Texas state lege took up a law to prohibit Walmart, Target, and other ""major retailers"" from selling ""obscene devices"" which would includ the various vibratiors and whatnot Walmart and HEB (our locla grocery monopoly) stock.

The bill,  H.B. 1549, passed through committee and is going to be voted on this year. I've no idea if it's expected to pass or not, but it got through the first stages of becoming law.

In Texas dildos are more restricted than guns, I wish that was a hyperbolic or comic exaggeration but it's the literal truth. You can walk through any major street in Texas, or through zoos, museums, or college campuses, while wearing an AR15 strapped to your chest, a shotgun over your shoulder, two pistols on each hip, and a holdout gun in your boot and no one is allowed to ask you to knock it off. 

But if you carry a dildo openly you'd be arrested instantly and if they can find a child who might have seen it you'll be labeled as a sexual predator, put on the list, and serve extra jail time.

That law is still on the books but is now considered unenforceable and unconstitutional. Lieberman told me sellers got around the law by claiming the toys were for “medical purposes.”

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is auditing Elon Musk’s [so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)](https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-digital-coup-doge-data-ai/).

The probe, which has been ongoing since March, covers DOGE’s handling of data at several Cabinet-level agencies, including the Departments of Labor, Education, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, the Treasury, and the Social Security Administration, as well as the US DOGE Service (USDS) itself, according to sources and records reviewed by WIRED.

Records show that the GAO—an independent auditing, research, and investigative agency for Congress—appears to be requesting comprehensive information from the agencies in question, including incident reports on “potential or actual misuse of agency systems or data” and documentation of policies and procedures relating to systems DOGE operatives have accessed, as well as documentation of policies for the agency's risk assessments, audit logs, insider threat programs, and more.

The GAO’s review is expected to be completed by the end of spring, according to records reviewed by WIRED. Congressional sources say it will yield a report that will be made public.

technology,1js7ro3,mlnsobx,"Wow. It’s amazing how many Americans don’t understand basic economics. There are import and export tariffs. Import tariffs are paid by importers and export tariffs are paid by manufacturers/exporters. Taxes get paid in the country they operate/reside in. Import tariffs dissuade importation of products by making it more expensive for consumers to receive a product. Export tariffs dissuade exportation by making it more expensive to send a product somewhere. In both cases, the product can still be shipped and received, it just costs more for the manufacturer or consumer depending on which kind of tariff.

The thing Americans seem to not grasp is America imposed import tariffs on its own citizens because it can’t impose export tariffs in other countries that get paid to the US government. Control over taxation policy is part of each country’s sovereignty. No country is going to allow America to dictate its taxation system. No company is going to sell a product at a loss to American importers so that Americans can pay taxes to their own government. There’s no business sense. The pickle nintendo is in right now is how many switches they need to sell in other markets to recoup their investment if Americans are too broke to buy them because of taxes that only apply to Americans.

The store selling you the Switch is the customer of Nintendo. They’re the importer. They get hit with the tax that they pass on to you, the consumer. If you were to have a Switch shipped directly to you from Japan, you’re the importer and you’ll pay the tariff to the US Government through the shipping courrier in order to have the product delivered. If you don’t pay, the product gets refused at the border and sent back to the sender. The entitlement of Americans who can’t grasp how tariffs work is astounding.",37,2025-04-06 06:14:36,spirit-mush

technology,1jv4dei,mm7cngw,"From the article: In early January, a peculiar warning rippled through the offices of the Environmental Protection Agency. It didn’t come in an official memo or policy update. Instead, it was whispered among managers, passed down from political appointees to federal employees: Be careful what you say, what you type and what you do.

The warning referred not to a new code of conduct, but to a new kind of surveillance — one allegedly powered by artificial intelligence and quietly embedded by a team working directly under Elon Musk.

The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has become one of the most controversial instruments of the Trump administration’s second term. It was launched with the stated goal of slashing $1 trillion in federal spending and eliminating “waste, fraud and abuse.” Since then, DOGE has been rapidly redrawing the boundaries of how technology is used within government.

But according to nearly 20 insiders and hundreds of pages of court documents reviewed by [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/musks-doge-using-ai-snoop-us-federal-workers-sources-say-2025-04-08/), what’s happening inside DOGE looks less like reform and more like a shadow state.

At the center of the controversy is DOGE’s alleged use of artificial intelligence to monitor internal communications across at least one federal agency. According to three people familiar with internal discussions at the EPA, DOGE operatives are rolling out tools to scan Microsoft Teams chats and emails for signs of sentiment considered hostile to Trump or Musk.

“We have been told they are looking for anti-Trump or anti-Musk language,” said one source with direct knowledge of the EPA’s internal guidance.

EPA officials later confirmed they were exploring AI to “optimize agency functions,” but denied using it for personnel decisions. Still, the climate inside the agency has shifted dramatically. Since January, more than 600 workers have been placed on leave, and the agency is preparing to cut 65% of its budget.

Ethics experts say this raises red flags about free speech and political intimidation within federal institutions. Kathleen Clark, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis, put it bluntly. “It sounds like an abuse of government power to suppress or deter speech that the president of the United States doesn’t like.”",88,2025-04-09 12:54:58,chrisdh79

No. Even Trump most critical follower would gladly accept the Parties retelling of reality before them with open palms. They lack even the most Common Sense that built the US and now they may as well be damning it to a fate worse than Hell.

Thomas Paine once said that 'Society in every state is a blessing, but Government, even in its best state, is but a necessary evil; in its worst state an intolerable one: for when we suffer, or are exposed to the same miseries BY A GOVERNMENT, which we might expect in a country WITHOUT GOVERNMENT, our calamity is heightened by reflecting that we furnish the means by which we suffer.'.

Federal policy notwithstanding, though, the allure of clean power continues to attract US business leaders, as demonstrated by Ford’s new clean power purchase agreement with the Michigan utility DTE.

The new power purchase agreement between Ford and DTE is not just the biggest one struck between the two parties. DTE also states that it is the biggest clean power PPA from a utility in all of US history.

For those of you new to the topic, PPAs are routinely used to construct new utility-scale wind farms and solar arrays. They enable energy buyers to lock in credit for a fresh supply of kilowatts from a new power plant before construction begins. PPAs also provide energy infrastructure developers with a firm footing to solicit whatever other financing they need to complete their projects, so it’s a win-win all around.

As for the historical perspective, PPAs are a relatively new scattershot development in domestic energy-related transactions. They were authorized by federal law in 1978, as a response to the 1970s oil crisis. The idea was to make financing a new power plant easier, though to this day some states laws continue to prohibit PPAs outright, while others have imposed restrictions.

Still, laying claim to the biggest clean power PPA from a utility is a significant achievement that demonstrates how vital the PPA structure has been, and continues to be, for the US energy transition. It is also a big poke at President Trump’s multi-pronged efforts to withdraw federal support for wind and solar energy (especially offshore wind, but that’s a whole ‘nother can of worms).

650 More Megawatts Of Clean Power For Ford
The new solar PPA between Ford and DTE clocks in at 650 megawatts. If you can find a bigger one for a wind or solar project from a utility in all of US history, drop a note in the comment thread.

The new PPA is also of interest because it covers a series of new solar arrays, not just one power plant. DTE broke ground on the first one last week, a 100-megawatt solar array near Coldwater, Michigan.",169,2025-04-22 11:00:32,chrisdh79

These licenses give Beijing control over not just where these materials go, but how fast they go, in what quantity, and to which politically convenient customers.

The U.S.? Let’s just say Washington should get comfortable waiting behind the rope line. The licenses have to be applied for and the end use including country of final destination must be clearly spelled out. Licenses for end uses in the U.S. are unlikely to be approved. What’s astonishing is how predictable this all was. China has spent decades building its dominance over these supply chains, while the U.S. was busy outsourcing, divesting, and cheerfully ignoring every report that said, “Hey, maybe 90% dependence on a single country we keep starting trade wars with and rattling sabers at is a bad idea.”

  
The materials China just restricted aren’t random. They’re chosen with the precision of someone who’s read U.S. product spec sheets and defense procurement orders. Start with dysprosium. If your electric motor needs to function at high temperatures—and they all do—then mostly it is using neodymium magnets doped with dysprosium. No dysprosium, no thermal stability. No thermal stability, no functioning motor in your F-35 or your Mustang Mach-E. China controls essentially the entire supply of dysprosium, and no, there is no magical mine in Wyoming or Quebec waiting in the wings. If dysprosium doesn’t come out of China, it doesn’t come out at all. It’s the spinal cord of electrification, and right now China’s holding the vertebrae.",1211,2025-04-06 18:14:39,Wagamaga

>Economist James Surowiecki quickly reverse-engineered a possible explanation for the tariff pricing. He found you could recreate each of the White House’s numbers by simply taking a given country’s trade deficit with the US and dividing it by their total exports to the US. Halve that number, and you get a ready-to-use “discounted reciprocal tariff.” The White House objected to this claim and published the formula it says that it used, but as Politico points out, the formula looks like a dressed-up version of Surowiecki’s method.
>
>In case you weren’t sure, Surowiecki calls this approach “extraordinary nonsense.” So why did Trump’s team use it? Well, like plenty of people who’ve realized their homework is due in three hours’ time, it seems like they may have been tempted by AI.
>
>A number of X users have realized that if you ask ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, or Grok for an “easy” way to solve trade deficits and put the US on “an even playing field”, they’ll give you a version of this “deficit divided by exports” formula with remarkable consistency. The Verge tested this with the phrasing used in those posts, as well as a question based more closely on the government’s language, asking chatbots for “an easy way for the US to calculate tariffs that should be imposed on other countries to balance bilateral trade deficits between the US and each of its trading partners, with the goal of driving bilateral trade deficits to zero.” All four platforms gave us the same fundamental suggestion.

23andMe said in court documents viewed by 404 Media that since hackers obtained personal data about seven million of its customers in October 2023, including, in some cases “health-related information based upon the user’s genetics,” it has faced “over 50 class action and state court lawsuits,” and that “approximately 35,000 claimants have initiated, filed, or threatened to commence arbitration claims against the company.” It is seeking bankruptcy protection in part to simplify the fallout of these legal cases, and because it believes it may not have money to pay for the potential damages associated with these cases. 

CEO and cofounder Anne Wojcicki announced she is leaving the company as part of this process. The company has the genetic data of more than 15 million customers.

According to its Chapter 11 filing, 23andMe owes money to a host of pharmaceutical companies, pharmacies, artificial intelligence companies (including a company called Aganitha AI and Coreweave), as well as health insurance companies and marketing companies.",425,2025-03-24 18:42:31,chrisdh79

It is possible for a Siri contact suggestion to pull such a number in, and mis-attribute it - but I believe they would have to 'accept' it before it becomes an actual number in a contact, and only then would it be possible for Signal to interpret it as a contact to discover via phone number.

>The plaintiffs, M. Brunner and J.

Both also say that if they’d known they weren’t speaking directly to the creators themselves, they wouldn’t have subscribed, or would have paid less to subscribe. If OnlyFans stopped creators from using agencies to talk to fans they would consider going back to spending money on the platform, they say. 
>
>...
>
>OnlyFans agencies have been a well-documented industry for years—especially the chatting aspect, where people employed by an agency manage creators’ messages and in some cases, respond to fans. Not all OnlyFans creators use agencies or “chatters,” but there are dozens of agencies that advertise the service. A November 2021 lawsuit against Unruly Agency alleged that the company preyed on and defrauded fans into divulging their ""deepest and innermost personal secrets including sexual fantasies and fetishes, marital troubles, suicidal ideations, and other private desires to account managers and senior account managers.""
>
>“Creators may choose to work with a wide range of third parties, including photographers, videographers, talent managers and agencies, to curate and monetise their content,” an OnlyFans spokesperson told Cosmopolitan last year for a story about OnlyFans models who use agencies to be more productive. “Any third party that a creator elects to work with does not work on behalf of OnlyFans and is not affiliated with the company in any way.”

This isn't Hegseth being a moron and it doesn't end with him being reassigned. Everyone on that group chat is deliberately avoiding oversight because they know from the first Trump Term that almost everything they are doing is illegal in some way.

technology,1k1a91t,mnkdsvb,"From the article: The digital coup unfolding across America's federal agencies just exposed a disturbing international dimension. A whistleblower at the National Labor Relations Board has documented how DOGE's data theft was immediately followed by attempted access from Russian IP addresses – raising grave questions about foreign intelligence penetration of America's most sensitive systems.

Daniel Berulis, an IT professional at the NLRB, provided forensic evidence showing that within minutes after DOGE engineers gained ""God-tier"" access to sensitive labor systems, someone operating from Russia attempted to log in using newly-created DOGE credentials. Not just random guessing – they had the correct username and password.

This wasn't just some random hacking attempt. According to Berulis' official disclosure to Congress: ""Those attempts were 'near real-time'... Whoever was attempting to log in was using one of the newly created DOGE accounts — and the person had the correct username and password.""

While these Russian login attempts were blocked, they reveal the immediate vulnerability created by DOGE's activities. The timing suggests either shocking carelessness or something far more sinister – coordination with foreign intelligence services.

Cybersecurity experts who reviewed Berulis' evidence saw techniques consistent with sophisticated Russian intelligence operations. Former FBI cyber official Russ Handorf noted these actions match what we've seen from Russian threat actors targeting U.S. government systems in the past. The key difference? ""They were given the keys to the front door.""

This Russian connection is especially alarming given Elon Musk's well-documented ties to Putin and Russian oligarchs. His companies have received significant Russian investment, including from sanctioned billionaires. The whistleblower's attorney specifically noted the foreign intelligence dimension, stating: ""This case has been particularly sensitive as it involves the possibility of sophisticated foreign intelligence gaining access to sensitive government systems.""",342,2025-04-17 11:17:46,chrisdh79

technology,1jzs94v,mn929d0,"Years ago, I knew a DOE scientist who worked on classified nuclear security issues. They were returning to the country from an official trip to China. Because of the security issues in China, they had been carrying specially-issued encrypted devices from DOE, including a phone and a laptop. 

At the border, US CBP officers demanded to search her devices. Because of the classified nature of her work and because they were encrypted, CBP could not access them without her password. She refused (again, classified -- it would have been illegal for her to comply), and was detained. She spent a day in airport jail while DOE and DHS lawyers hashed it out. Eventually CBP held the devices and she was freed. But the idea that even a US Government classified laptop can trigger a stubborn legal fight between agencies is all you need to know about what these people prioritize.

CBP is bad, it's been out of control for a long time, and they are now completely unhinged with their abusive detentions. Even as a US citizen I wouldn't cross the border with my own devices these days. The goon squad is out of control.",384,2025-04-15 15:50:26,this_shit

technology,1k3kgmz,mo2pp8o,"From the article: Four days before Donald Trump’s inauguration, financial technology startup Ramp published a pitch for how to tackle wasteful government spending. In a 4,000-word blog post titled “The Efficiency Formula,” Ramp’s CEO and one of its investors echoed ideas similar to those promoted by Trump and his billionaire ally Elon Musk: Federal programs were overrun by fraud, and commonsense business techniques could provide a quick fix.

Ramp sells corporate credit cards and artificial intelligence software for businesses to analyze spending. And while the firm appears to have no existing federal contracts, the post implied the government should consider hiring it. Just as Ramp helped businesses manage their budgets, the company “could do the same for a variety of government agencies,” according to the blog and company social media posts.

It didn’t take long for Ramp to find a willing audience. Within Trump’s first three months in office, its executives scored at least four private meetings with the president’s appointees at the General Services Administration, which oversees major federal contracting. Some of the meetings were organized by the nation’s top procurement officer, Josh Gruenbaum, commissioner of the Federal Acquisition Service.

GSA is eying Ramp to get a piece of the government’s $700 billion internal expense card program, known as SmartPay. In recent weeks, Trump appointees at GSA have been moving quickly to tap Ramp for a charge card pilot program worth up to $25 million, sources told ProPublica, even as Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency highlights the multitudes of contracts it has canceled across federal agencies.",224,2025-04-20 11:28:06,chrisdh79

technology,1k24k02,mnr8id5,"Hey, thanks for sharing this! Here's a bit from the article:   
  
Doubtless you know the contours already: Jeff Bezos’ fiancee Lauren Sánchez, pop star Katy Perry, and four other women did a big space tourism trip in the name of performative femiladyism, wearing “space suits” cut so as to require a pair of Spanx underneath. “We’re going to have lash extensions flying in the capsule,” Sánchez said. “We are going to put the ‘ass’ in astronaut,” Perry said.

This promised to be a marketing bonanza for a nation addled by spectacle. What has happened instead has been a shocking amount of backlash. TikToks mocking Katy Perry’s feigned enthusiasm for “astronomy and astrology.” Suggestions the entire trip was faked. Video footage of what appears to be Bezos literally falling on his face in Texas. Did Bezos even really open the capsule door? Proclamations that the flight “showcased the utter defeat of American feminism.” Social media debates about whether the women aboard were passengers or crew.

I have been sitting here for a couple of hours now, trying to figure out how this happened, while my fearless leader has been sending me TikTok after TikTok about how dumb the whole thing was.

Look, the ass has always been in astronaut — NASA mandates that those aboard the ISS do not miss leg day. Even under normal circumstances, Perry, Sánchez, and the other women would be guilty of delivering stale rhetoric about how doing space tourism was reclaiming science for the girlies. But here, it was all happening against the insistent drumbeats of budget cuts at actual NASA, while the other rocket entrepreneur, Elon Musk, rearranged the agency to benefit himself.

For a Ph D scholar, a cancelled grant could mean going home after an incomplete Ph D -- which could mean flushing years of time down the toilet, and having no path back to employment, much less to research.

2. Most Ph D scholars don't submit grants themselves (I could be wrong) but are taken on as a part of the funding of the lab. So their control over this situation is exactly ZERO.

*[...] The Guardian is now helping resurrect and display the short-lived tool, which was keenly awaited within Fema as the first free, localized resource showing how much climate change impacts will cost American communities.*

*Drawing data from across federal government agencies, the index has county-by-county information on projected annual losses this century from threats including extreme heat, coastal flooding , wildfires, hurricanes and drought, all of which are worsened by human-caused global heating. Each county was also given an overall risk rating, which ranked how vulnerable its particular population is to climate shocks.*

*Such information is crucial for planning by local governments, insurers, utilities and others that look to Fema to help contend with a growing list of disasters now rending American communities, according to Victoria Salinas, who was deputy administrator of resilience at Fema during Joe Biden’s administration.*

*“It doesn’t matter if you call it climate change or not, the consequences are getting worse and so we were trying to play catch-up,” said Salinas.*

*[...] The Future Risk Index was initially restored to public view by Fulton Ring, a software and data company. The company’s founders, Rajan Desai and Jeremy Herzog, said they were aghast at the Trump administration’s removal of online climate data and didn’t want taxpayer-funded work to go to waste.*

*“We knew this was in the crosshairs because other tools like it have been shut down,” said Herzog. “We felt this would be a high-integrity action to take, more impactful than just protesting. People should be asking why these datasets are being taken down for political motivations.”*",216,2025-03-26 17:10:14,marketrent

The GOP only wants one thing:  to enrich billionaires.  That's it!  That's the sum-total of everything they want.  And, it's been the only thing they've wanted for literally decades now.  The majority of government revenue comes from rich people (via taxes).  Rich people pay WAY more tax than you do.  As a result, they DESPISE taxes and always want to lower them to zero.

The government still needs to exist, however, so you can't just drop taxes on billionaires to zero!  

Or can you?!!

In fact, you can.  Instead of collecting income taxes from billionaires - you can collect tariffs instead.  And REGULAR PEOPLE pay for those!  Not billionaires.  Regular people (in the form of considerably-higher prices on everything they buy).

When you pay 25% more for a car (or eggs, or clothes, or computer chips, or whatever), that extra 25% will cover what the billionaires aren't paying anymore!

The GOP is shifting the ENTIRE cost of the government onto the poor and middle-class, so the rich people won't have to pay for it anymore!  

And all of you are seemingly fine with it all!  They are stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from each and every one of you - and it's not affecting you personally (well, not that you realize - yet), so you don't care, and are just letting them do it.

Wednesday morning, Nintendo formally announced the Switch 2, and its $449 price, which is $150 more than the Switch. A few hours later, Trump announced tariffs on the entire world, with particularly large fees on China, Vietnam, and Cambodia. 

There are going to be far more important and damaging impacts of Trump’s unilateral trade war on everyone than the price of an already expensive game console likely going up. The U.S. stock market has already plunged. But the timing and narrative around the Switch 2—the successor to one of the most popular games consoles of all time—highlights how destabilizing this is likely to be, the interconnectedness of the global economy, and the fact that Trump cannot just snap his fingers and onshore manufacturing to the United States without massive pain. Gamers, understandably, are pissed, and award-winning economists say they are right to be. I thought it’d be useful to discuss the broader impact of the tariffs with leading economics by focusing on the Switch 2, because it’s such a high-profile item.

“The policy announcement is astonishing for its stupidity,” Gene Grossman, a global trade expert and Princeton professor who won the Onassis Prize in International Trade, told 404 Media. “It seems like a joke!” He added that it is hard to know exactly what will happen given the overall “sea of idiocy” brought on by the tariffs.",184,2025-04-03 18:06:13,chrisdh79

technology,1jm5uc5,mk95lb5,"By Sean O’Kane:

*[...] The new tariff regime comes at an auspicious time for Tesla. The company is dealing with the fallout of Musk’s promotion of far-right ideology and his involvement with the unpopular Department of Government Efficiency, which has sparked protests around the world.*

*Tesla has recently relied on promotions and price cuts to boost sales, and yet it still sold fewer EVs in 2024 than it did in 2023 and is off to a rough start in 2025.*

*New tariffs could shift that calculus, at least in the U.S. Tesla builds all of its cars destined for the North American market in the U.S. at factories in Fremont, California, and Austin, Texas. That means none of the cars it sells in the U.S. will be subject to the 25% vehicle import tax.*

*Tesla does import around 20% to 30% of the components used to build those cars, so that will cause some headache.*

*[...] Much like Tesla, upstart electric automakers like Rivian and Lucid Motors won’t have to worry about the vehicle import tariffs because they make their EVs in Illinois and Arizona, respectively.*

*Like Tesla, they import parts that will be subject to tariffs — but they are in a worse position to absorb those costs since both companies are still losing buckets of money on every EV they sell.*

*This sets up a scenario where other EVs may see price increases greater than any Tesla might implement.*",13,2025-03-28 21:18:59,marketrent

A Microsoft employee disrupted the company’s 50th anniversary event to protest its use of AI.

“Shame on you,” said Microsoft employee Ibtihal Aboussad, speaking directly to Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman. “You are a war profiteer. Stop using AI for genocide. Stop using AI for genocide in our region. You have blood on your hands. All of Microsoft has blood on its hands. How dare you all celebrate when Microsoft is killing children. Shame on you all.”

Sources at Microsoft tell The Verge that shortly after Aboussad was ushered out of Microsoft’s event, she sent an email to a number of email distribution lists that contain hundreds or thousands of Microsoft employees.

Coulter, a Harvard graduate with a background in investment management, was added to SSA’s org chart this week as CIO. Mike Russo, who started as the agency’s top IT official Feb. 3, according to an SSA spokesperson, is now listed as senior advisor to the commissioner.

According to his LinkedIn profile, Coulter holds a bachelor’s and master’s degree in applied mathematics and previously worked as a private equity analyst at The Blackstone Group. He founded the New York-based investment management firm Cowbird Capital in 2017, per his profile.""

>  
Kseniia Petrova, 30, a researcher at Harvard Medical School, was detained by Customs and Border Protection for failing to declare the scientific material properly at Boston Logan International Airport while she was returning from a trip to France on February 16. 

>Petrova was legally in the US on a J-1 visa sponsored by Harvard so that she could work in the lab as a biomedical researcher. 

>  
When Customs discovered the frog embryos in her luggage, she was detained, questioned and had her visa revoked. 

>Romanovsky argues that ICE overstepped its jurisdiction by revoking Petrova's visa for an offense that typically only requires a fine of up to $500. 

>Petrova's lawyer added that the fine is usually decreased to just $50 for first offenses. 

  
So, briefly, she was here on a proper visa, sponsored by Harvard. She went to France and brought some research materials back. She did not declare this properly, but the materials were completely legal otherwise. This could under normal circumstances lead to a fine of maximum $500, but in this case they decided to revoke her visa instead.

Because she risks persecution in Russia if deported there (she fled Russia after being arrested for protesting against the war in Ukraine) she has now been in jail for several months.

This is all due to a small documentation error related to completely legal research samples.",1513,2025-04-22 09:57:24,azthal

She is now being held at ICE’s Richwood Correctional Center in Monroe, Louisiana, and fighting possible deportation to Russia, where she said she fears persecution and jail time over her protests against the war in Ukraine.

technology,1k4cumu,mo905io,"Gone are the days when “Global warming isn’t real” was the primary claim of those most vocally opposed to climate action. As more people experience the firsthand effects of climate-change-juiced-up heat waves, hurricanes, wildfires, and crop failures, a new kind of climate denial has emerged. Rather than outright deny the problem, today, the most popular online influencers focus on other false or misleading messages like “Climate solutions don’t work,” “Climate change has some benefits,” and pollution reduction policies are “tools for governments to control people.”

These new forms of denial made up 70% of all such claims on YouTube in 2023, up from 35% in 2018, according to the Center for Countering Digital Hate.

  
A changing media diet 
About one in five U.S. adults and 37% of adults under 30 say they regularly get news from social media influencers, according to Pew. 

Of the 10 most popular online shows, eight have spread false or misleading information about climate change, a Yale Climate Connections analysis found. That analysis builds on recent work by Media Matters for America, a journalism watchdog organization, which found that right-leaning influencers now dominate digital media like podcasts and streams. 

  
Much of the climate-related misinformation spread on these shows follows a revamped playbook of climate denial that focuses on denying the effectiveness of solutions and argues that climate change is beneficial. Influencers Jordan Peterson and Charlie Kirk also presented those concerned about climate change as adherents of a “pseudo-religion.” 

  
For context, most people around the world, including the United States, are concerned about climate change. Our partners at the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication have found that the majority of Americans believe climate change is happening, it’s bad, and action should be taken.

  
Nevertheless, many online personalities, including Joe Rogan, Ben Shapiro, and Russell Brand, have platformed Danish political scientist, author, and climate denier Bjørn Lomborg.

Palantir, the surveillance giant, is taking on an increased role with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), including finding the physical location of people who are marked for deportation, according to Palantir Slacks and other internal messages obtained by 404 Media.

The leak shows that Palantir’s work with ICE includes producing leads for law enforcement to find people to deport and keeping track of the logistics of Trump’s mass deportation effort, and provides concrete insight into the Trump administration’s wish to leverage data to enforce its immigration agenda. The internal communications also show Palantir leadership preparing for a potential backlash from employees or outsiders, with them writing FAQs that can be sent to friends or family that start to ask about Palantir’s work with ICE. 

“Hey all, wanted to provide a quick update on our work with ICE,” Akash Jain, the Chief Technology Officer of Palantir Technologies and President of Palantir USG, wrote in a Slack message several days ago. “Over the last few weeks we prototyped a new set of data integrations and workflows with ICE.”",368,2025-04-17 15:08:49,chrisdh79

technology,1k1f4jc,mnn3pul,"I feel compelled to add a comment here, because the grim truth is that this exact scenario regarding Palantir was first written about over 15 years ago. Palantir began its life as a military contractor working for the CIA and NSA, touting their Big Data approach to providing intel for the U.S. military to aide in uncovering terrorist cells around the world. They were obviously good at it. However, multiple tech journalists at the time questioned and wrote several pieces on the methods used to obtain and manipulate their Big Data, and specifically, how easy it would be for Palantir to fit American citizen’s data into their existing frameworks. Obviously the inner workings of Palantir were speculation from industry experts and whatever insights Karp gave the public, but the danger that Palantir would be used within U.S. borders and on U.S. citizens always remained a prominent plausibility. 

People knew this would eventually happen, but none of the people in power listened, or cared, and now a tool that was marketed as a way to root out terrorists is being used within our borders and on our citizens.

Given how badly he fucked up Xitter, and the fact that Tesla and SpaceX literally have to employ babysitters to keep him away from the actual business as much as possible, and the years of failed promises surrounding FSD for Tesla cars, he is not the person to head up such an effort. 

A project like this probably only takes a couple of months to replicate 98% of the functionality of existing systems. What comes next is years upon years of testing and dealing with weird edge cases. That's the part where Xitler would get bored and just walk away. You may think 98% is pretty good, but the 2% that's missing has actual people who will be affected at the other end. No, people shouldn't be depending on social security as their only source of income, but that's a whole other topic. 

I say if Xitler wants to do this, make him and his DOGE cronies all live on a standard social security income during the entire process. They won't actually get money from the government, that's just the cap on how much money they can spend in a month. No private jets, no dining at high end restaurants, no buying Path of Exile 2 accounts to make it seem like you're some uber good player, you get like $200/week or whatever a typical SS payment is, and that's it.

It's absolutely bonkers that we're still typing credit card info into forms that we then have to trust are safely stored. And watch these inevitable hacks happen over and over again.

Edit: a quick explanation on how this works under the hood. You install a browser extension that generates a public key/private key pair. You send the public key to your credit card company and any vendors you want to do business with. When you want to do a transaction, the vendor sends you a string representing the transaction. It might be ""Buy 2 shirts from Amazon, item 8769876987 for $17.99 each"". The user clicks ""Sign Transaction"" and the app encrypts the string using the private key and sends it back to the vendor. The vendor decrypts the string using the users public key. If the result matches the original string, the vendor knows that the user owns the private key associated with the public key. The vendor then sends both messages back to the credit card company, who also verifies the matching signature. In this way, you never need to send to critical information to the vendor at all. The standard practice sends everything needed to sign a transaction to every single vendor. It's a crazy way to do things.

TLDR: You sign a transaction using the private key (only the user can do this). You verify the signature using the public key (anyone can do this).",241,2025-04-20 13:40:01,wes_reddit

Here's an article([https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/15/musklemons/](https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/15/musklemons/)) that shows Tesla has a proven history of egregious lies and deception. It doesn't instill trust in Tesla when you read about their 2023 ""fake service operation"" scam they set up that not only ""punished"" drivers for their valid concerns but could have potentially resulted in extremely dangerous consequences in some situations. How could you ever trust a company that knowingly engaged in this type of behaviour? 

In the summer of 2023, the company was caught lying to drivers about its cars' range:

[https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/28/edison-not-tesla/#demon-haunted-world](https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/28/edison-not-tesla/#demon-haunted-world)

Drivers noticed that they were getting *far* fewer miles out of their batteries than Tesla had advertised. Naturally, they contacted the company for service on their faulty cars. Tesla then set up an entire fake service operation in Nevada that these calls would be diverted to, called the ""diversion team."" Drivers with range complaints were put through to the ""diverters"" who would claim to run ""remote diagnostics"" on their cars and then assure them the cars were fine. They even installed a special xylophone in the diversion team office that diverters would ring every time they successfully deceived a driver.

These customers were then put in an invisible Tesla service jail. Their Tesla apps were silently altered so that they could no longer book service for their cars for *any* reason – instead, they'd have to leave a message and wait several days for a callback. The diversion center racked up 2,000 calls/week and diverters were under strict instructions to keep calls under five minutes. Eventually, these diverters were told that they should stop actually performing remote diagnostics on the cars of callers – instead, they'd just *pretend* to have run the diagnostics and claim no problems were found (so if your car had a potentially dangerous fault, they would falsely claim that it was safe to drive).",6,2025-04-17 12:54:30,dodgyrogy

technology,1jwvwoo,mmllstw,"Thanks for sharing our story. Here's a snippet for some context: 

The Social Security Administration will no longer be communicating with the media and the public through press releases and “dear colleague” letters, as it shifts its public communication exclusively to X, sources tell WIRED. This comes as the regional office workforce will soon be cut by roughly 87 percent, sources tell WIRED. Regional office staff manage IT support, policy questions, labor relations issues, reasonable accommodations guidance, and public relations. Since February, the SSA has cut 7,000 jobs, according to the *Washington Post*.

The letters and press releases were a crucial communications tool for SSA employees, who used them to stay up on agency news. Since SSA staff cannot sign up for social media on government computers without submitting a special security request, the change could have negative consequences on the ability for employees to do their jobs.

It could also impact people receiving social security benefits who rely on the letters for information about access benefits. “Do they really expect senior citizens will join this platform?” asked one current employee. “Most managers aren’t even on it. How isn’t this a conflict of interest?” Another staffer added: “This will ensure that the public does not get the information they need to stay up to date.”

technology,1jmwktq,mkf3f3f,"By Karl Bode:

*[...] Studies generally show publicly-funded journalism tends to result in healthier democracies for the reasons outlined above. Making journalism a publicly-funded public good (and not a business) has great potential. But the right wing generally sees it as a threat because it’s not as prone to soften its criticism of corporatism or authoritarianism.*

*But after a generation of demonization of the idea, it’s basically a non-starter in the U.S. And the few partially publicly-funded news organizations we do have are already seeing relentless harassment by the Trump administration.*

*NPR (which only gets about 1% of its money from the public) and PBS are already facing sham investigations by Trump earlobe nibbler and FCC boss Brendan Carr. Now Carr is taking aim at smaller public broadcasters as well.*

*Carr recently sent a letter to WBEZ and twelve other local public broadcasters to inform them they were under investigation for on-air sponsorships, commonly referred to as “underwriting.”*

*Carr is pretending to be concerned that the stations aren’t following FCC rules restricting them from airing traditional commercials:*

>*“I am concerned that NPR and PBS broadcasts could be violating federal law by airing commercials. It is possible that NPR and PBS member stations are broadcasting underwriting announcements that cross the line into prohibited commercial advertisements.”*

*About 4.6% (1.6%) of WEBZ’s operating revenue comes from public funding. Publicly-funded broadcasters are restricted from running traditional commercials. So instead, they generally run corporate underwriting spots acknowledging corporate support.*

*WEBZ and the other companies all say they’ve consistently adhered to the rules. Carr has offered no evidence of actual violations.*

*[...] a cornerstone of the modern radical right involves mercilessly attacking education, academia, journalism, and informed consensus. And another key cornerstone has been to build a vast right wing propaganda machine across AM radio, broadcast TV, cable TV, and the internet that tells right wingers what they want to hear 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.*

technology,1jlwil2,mk720d6,"Thanks for sharing our piece. Here's a snippet for some context: The so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is starting to put together a team to migrate the Social Security Administration’s (SSA) computer systems entirely off one of its oldest programming languages in a matter of months, potentially putting the integrity of the system—and the benefits on which tens of millions of Americans rely—at risk.

The project is being organized by Elon Musk lieutenant Steve Davis, multiple sources who were not given permission to talk to the media tell WIRED, and aims to migrate all SSA systems off COBOL, one of the first common business-oriented programming languages, and onto a more modern replacement like Java within a scheduled tight timeframe of a few months.

This was a theory of why it won't work long term and it's coming true.


It's even worse because 1 AI is talking to another ai ( ai 2 ) and it's copying each other.

The ""conventional wisdom"" that an ai will only degrade by training on ai generated outputs is so far off-base that its the opposite of reality. Most models these days have synthetic data in their pipeline! This is literally how model distillation works! This is how deepseek made their reasoning model! The cause of hallucinations is not that simple.
