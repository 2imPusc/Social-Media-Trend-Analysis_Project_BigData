music,1jxrtpl,What's a song quote that motivates you to go forward?,"This randomly crossed my mind, because just now while I was listening to music on shuffle, this song ""Sunflower"" by Rex Orange County started playing, which reminded me of this again:

""Sunflower still grows at night,
Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes""

A sunflower is known for following the sun during the day, and being at its peak when the sun is present. But the idea of it continuing to grow at night says that even in darkness or challenging times, we can still grow and be positive. 
""Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes"" is like a sense of longing and hope, and waiting for something positive to happen. That's my interpretation at least :)",25,0.84,65,2025-04-12 21:25:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1jxrtpl/whats_a_song_quote_that_motivates_you_to_go/,No_Interaction_7760

music,1jv0w2q,"Anyone else feel music too much? Like, physically?","Sometimes I wonder if my brain processes music differently.It’s not just a sound thing for me – it’s physical.

Some songs make my chest tighten. Certain frequencies make me flinch.
I’ve even had moments where a beautiful harmony made me feel like crying and hiding at the same time.

For years I thought this was a weakness.
Like I was just “too sensitive” or overreacting.
But what if it’s just a different sensory configuration?
A different kind of perception?

So I’m curious – does anyone else here experience music as something overwhelming?
Not just emotionally, but in your body too?

What part of music hits you the hardest – volume, rhythm, specific sounds?
Do you feel it more as a gift or a challenge?

Since he didn't leave us with a memoir, he said that these books would give us insight to who he truly was as an artist. I've been working on his list for a year now, and all I can say is WOW. I often will read while I'm listening to his instrumental tunes in the background and I truly feel like I understand him more as an artist now than ever before. I love his music so much and it was clear from his writing and musical creations he was unique, but it's been such a pleasure to get to experience more of the content that he put into his own mind that made him such an artistic genius.

music,1jraqrl,"Which legendary albums from any genre and era that you still listen to from start to finish (that in your opinion has no wack song on it, no skipped tracks)?","Wanted to update some things, so sorry for deleting the previous one.

Any Albums by Bob Marley & The Wailers.
My parents were massive fans of his music before I was even born. When I was growing up, I heard his music consistently at home, events, weddings, parties, barbecues. His songs still make me feel peaceful when I hear it. Every album of his has no song that doesn't sound dated. It sounds like it could be released.

I like that 21st century artists like Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Alicia Keys, Lana Del Rey, etc are making albums that are about quality not just quantity. It will make listeners listen to it consistently after hearing for the first time.

music,1jomcxq,Why can't we all like different music without being told our taste is bad just because we don't like whatever else does.,"My family likes watching American Idol and I personally do not like it because I very much dislike 90% of the songs they choose. They're just not the kind of songs I want to hear being covered on this show but that's okay the show doesn't have to be for everybody. Now one person in my family in particular can't handle people's opinions that don't align with his own I've noticed and didn't like what I said. 

Saying I have no good taste in music unlike the rest of the family. I mean why do people feel the need to bash others because your taste doesn't align? Also why do some people feel like their opinions are superior to others it's a little ridiculous? I'm willing to agree to disagree and walk away I don't feel like my opinion is superior and then I have to defend it. There's just honestly no point.

 Also this man likes to tell you quite often to use your brains and acts like you're stupid as well as feeling like his opinions are superior and that he's always right you're wrong it's so aggravating. People need to learn that not everyone is going to agree with you all the time.

music,1jvigzp,Rock bands that should be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,"The Smiths - The Smiths are one of the shortest lived yet most popular rock bands of the 1980s. Active for only five years, they are one of the most influential bands. The Smiths had previously been nominated twice in 2015 and 2016 but missed both nominations. The Smiths are one of the pioneers of 1980s alternative/indie rock. 

Motorhead - Motorhead is one of the most popular heavy metal bands of all time. The band had a career lasting exactly 40 years, disbanding just after the death of lead vocalist and bassist Lemmy Kilmister. Several other members had died in the 2010s both before and after Lemmy - co-lead guitarist Wurzel in July 2011, original drummer Phil Taylor in November 2015 (just one month before Lemmy) and original lead guitarist ""Fast"" Eddie Clarke in January 2018 (becoming the last member of the band's classic ""original"" lineup). Motorhead was nominated for induction in 2020 but missed it. 

Iron Maiden - Iron Maiden is one of the most popular heavy metal bands of all time. Iron Maiden is one of the most controversial snubs when it comes to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Iron Maiden missed both nominations, having previously been nominated in both 2021 and 2023. 

Ronnie James Dio - Ronnie James Dio is an icon of heavy metal. He has been the lead vocalist of several big bands including Rainbow, Black Sabbath, Dio (his own solo band) and Heaven & Hell (technically a Black Sabbath reunion). Ronnie James Dio was also not inducted as a member of Black Sabbath during their induction in 2006. Ronnie James Dio died in May 2010 and he would love the honor. 

Motley Crue - Motley Crue is possibly the biggest 1980s hair/glam metal band out there and they have never even been nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band even claims that it's unlikely that they will ever be inducted.

music,1k32qr2,name an artist/band you have a love-hate relationship with,"I'm talking about these artists you think have ""undeniable"" talent, but they released questionable/bad albums along the way. These artists you're a fan of, but acknowledge and admit their discography is flawed. These artists you don't like as musicians but love as people outside the studio.

my personal pick is the Red Hot Chili Peppers. i generally like their music, but they have made albums that are either poorly executed or straight up boring. Generally, i think they don't get ""good"" until Mother's Milk. Anthony Kiedis can be pretty hit-or-miss with his vocal performances, but he's backed by a strong ensemble of talented musicians so he's partially justified. and yeah, the admission of making flippy floppy with an underage girl in his autobiography. but until he writes another ""Catholic School Girls Rule"" we chillin.",17,0.75,102,2025-04-19 18:21:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1k32qr2/name_an_artistband_you_have_a_lovehate/,Sufferjohn_Sleevends
