food,1jo58b6,[homemade] pad see ew!!,"hi guys! after trying a couple different recipes, I’ve finally got a Pad See Ew recipe that tastes very similar to the one I get from my favorite thai restaurant. I will post the recipe later today if you guys want! The only thing is, I don’t know how to make it spicy!! i’m not sure what type of chili oil/pepper mixture they normally use. I usually get spice level 10 at restaurants and I want to make the same at home! I tried using a chili oil I normally use in other dishes, but it gave it a very distinct different flavor that changed it a lot. When I ask for another serving of chili oil at the restaurant, they give me something that looks like thick pepper paste but not blended up like gochujang; almost like unblended gochujang is the best way I can describe it and i’m assuming that’s what they add to make it spicy. Any one actually know what it is?",339,0.98,44,2025-03-31 15:00:06,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jo58b6,shrugblimp
