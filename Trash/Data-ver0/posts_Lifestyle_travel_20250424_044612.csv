I think Chiado is more central to tourist spots we will be visiting, but also more expensive. Would staying in Principe Real be out of the way/inconvenient? Any advice is appreciated!

travel,1ju3ara,Turkey trip 22 days - looking for advice,"**Hi everyone!**

I’m looking for some advice for our Turkey trip this May/June. It’ll be my parents, my husband, and me — and it’s our first time visiting Turkey!

We’ll be there for 22 days (21 nights) and plan to rent a car. I decided to skip Cappadocia this time since it’s easy to fly there later, and we don’t want to spend too much time driving on this trip.

Here’s the first draft of our itinerary: I have about 17 nights planned so far. For the remaining 4 nights, I’m thinking of adding extra nights to a few places to make the trip less rushed and more enjoyable.



|location|hotel nights|
|:-|:-|
|Istanbul|4|
|iznik||
|Bursa|2|
|Bergama||
|Kusadasi|1|
|Denizli|1|
|Fethiye|2|
|Antalya|2|
|Isparta|1|
|Afyonkarahisar|1|
|Kutahya|1|



Some ideas I have:

* Add 1 more night each to Denizli, Kuşadası, Isparta, and Afyonkarahisar. **or**
* Add 1 more night each to Kuşadası, Fethiye, Antalya, and Isparta.
* Or what would you suggest?

We really want to see as many cool ancient sites and historical places as possible, and we also love hiking.

Any feedback would be super appreciated!! If you have any must-sees, hidden gems, or great food recommendations along the way, please let me know. Thank you so much!!",2,1.0,6,2025-04-08 02:38:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ju3ara/turkey_trip_22_days_looking_for_advice/,lobsterroll91

travel,1jtvqoi,Planning a trip to California to visit Yosemite/Sequoia and then to Monterey Bay for whale watching. I have no idea what I'm doing.,"Wife and I have never been west of the Mississippi River, and when we last planned a trip out West, it was cancelled due to us having a baby. We are now planning a trip to California for our 10 year anniversary in three years with our then-to-be 8 year old daughter. 

The rough-rough draft of our vacation plan is to fly into Fresno, head East to Monterey for a few days to whale watch, explore, and get some beach time in, and then head back to Fresno where we will then commute each day to either Yosemite or Sequoia National Parks. 

So, I have a few questions:

1. Is there a better place between Yosemite and Sequoia National Parks to stay? We chose Fresno due to the airport and reasonable distance between the two parks.
2. Is there a better bay-town, whale-watching area that is close by?
3. Would this trip be too much for an 8 year old?
4. Are any areas of the parks closed in mid-late April?
5. Does $6k seem doable for this trip over 9 or 10 days? We will lodge affordably, but comfortably, and eat fairly cheap. This price is being based on the hopes that our economy recovers by then.

I also welcome any travel tips or information pertaining to the areas we will be traveling to, as well as suggestions for other things to do while we're in the area. I think we plan on spending 9 or 10 days total, and we don't get many opportunities to do a trip like this, so that's why we're trying to cram so much in, while hopefully not taking away from each place. 

That's all I think! Thanks for any help.",2,1.0,5,2025-04-07 20:41:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jtvqoi/planning_a_trip_to_california_to_visit/,Calfkiller

travel,1jtsr55,One month in Mexico suggestions,"As my first year of teaching is drawing to a close I'm looking to take advantage of my summer break by spending at least a month in Mexico. I've been studying Spanish for over a year now and would like to get some immersion experience. I also like the idea of being able to stretch my dollar as I'm somewhat limited being on a teacher's salary.

My initial plan was to go to La Saladita and just spend a month surfing and relaxing on the beach. However, I've heard mixed things about the safety in Guerrero and US state department has the state on the ""do not travel"" list. While I've heard Saladita and Zihuatanejo are generally safe, it's given me some pause. I'm still not opposed to going forward with this plan if it's safe.

I've also been considering Mexico City or Oaxaca City as well.

travel,1jsyacm,Can someone either talk me into or out of this proposed itinerary? (Advice: Madrid/Granada),"Hello all. 

I am looking at a few options for travel later in the year (specifically November, although it doesn't have to be this month) and I was looking at Granada to see Alhambra. November is ideal for me based on my work schedule and also having mild weather for the region at that time of year. 

However, I see that there looks to only be one flight in to Granada each day, connecting from Madrid. I know that Malaga airport exists as well and is relatively close by, although getting to Granada would be another headache that I wouldn't want to deal with after a long transcontinental flight (I am from the US) and a connecting flight, and language barrier (my Spanish is okay, but I don't feel confident about it enough to really trust it-- I would also be doing this solo, which compounds my fears a little bit too) which would always stress me out. So, seeing as how I am not particularly comfortable about this, my alternate thinking would be to fly into Madrid and treat it as a long layover in a sense (I've always wanted to see Madrid too, but this would obviously not be doing it justice, which is another concern of mine-- would I be doing it just to check off a box, you know?) 

The flights I am currently looking into would land in Madrid at around 8:00 or 10:00 local time. I figure that would give me enough time to see at least most of the key sights in the city at a leisurely enough pace (I am mainly only really interested in the Royal Palace-- however not going in for a tour or anything like that-- and Parque del Retiro if I only had less than a day) as well as doing some self-guided walking tours, etc. 

That being the case, I would spend the night in Madrid and then take a train the next day to Granada and stay there for a few days, seeing the main sights of the city on arrival day, Alhambra the next day, and then a hike in the Sierra Nevada the next day. The tricky bit that I am wondering about is whether it is worth it to train back to Madrid and spend another day there before I depart back to the US or potentially fly back out of Granada (I think this would be more expensive). I would just be stressed about that because with only one flight out of Granada a day, if I missed it, I would be screwed. 

Basically, I am wondering if it would be a waste of time (and money, hotels in Madrid for these two nights would be more than what I have estimated my whole time in Granada to cost, for instance) to follow the below schedule: 

Nov. 21 -- Land in Madrid, see a few sights, etc. 

Nov 22-25 -- Train to Granada. Checking out of hotel on 11/25 and getting the train back to Madrid on that date. 

Nov 25 -- Back in Madrid and fly out the next day -- I would probably stay somewhere close to the airport just out of my own paranoia and so I can rest easy knowing I can get to the airport quickly and stress less about it on a tighter schedule (the return flight would be at around 10:00 in the morning). 

I am planning on doing something similar when I go to Ireland in a couple of months, where I'll be landing in Dublin, moving partway through to Belfast, and then returning the final day of the trip to go back to Dublin/airport area rather than trying to make a more complicated journey to the airport on the date of the return flight (I am a very nervous person in case you couldn't tell). Any information or advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you!

TL;DR -- Would you spend less than a day in Madrid before going off to Granada or would you try connecting from Madrid-- either to Malaga or Granada proper? ",2,1.0,5,2025-04-06 16:38:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jsyacm/can_someone_either_talk_me_into_or_out_of_this/,mdubs17

3. Would you recommend a day trip from Tarifa to Tangier?

travel,1js95vi,Trip Report: 8 days Solo-Travel in Florida from the UK,"**Summary:**

I solo travelled for 8 days (from the UK):

* 5 days in Orlando, within Disney World accommodation
* 3 days in Miami in South Beach (originally going to be 4 but left a day early)

*I caught a cold the day before my flight to Florida, so I shoved down medicine/cough suppressants every day but I ended up leaving Miami a day early, partly because of that and partly because I felt I was still jet lagged.*

  
**Itinerary:**

**Day 0** \- Arrived in evening in Orlando

**Day 1**: Kennedy Space Centre Day

This was pretty amazing - they have great tours within the key attractions. I found 1 day was sufficient to tick off the big name attractions, the Saturn V exhibit and the Atlantis Exhibit. Like others have said these were both awesome and worth seeing.

**Day 2**: Disney World Magic Kingdom  
**Day 3**: Disney World Hollywood Studios  
**Day 4**: Disney World Animal Kingdom  
**Day 5**: Disney World Epcot

**Day 6:** Took Brightline Train to Miami and stayed in South Beach area

**Day 7:** General exploring, hanging out on beach, going to Little Havana

**Day 8:** Ended up taking an early flight home this evening

  
**General comments about Orlando:**

My Orlando leg was centred around Disney World, and so I picked accommodation in Disney World to avoid having to travel into Disney World repeatedly. This turned out to be a pretty good decision.

I'd definitely recommend this as you can fairly easily get in and out of Disney World with Ubers or with a rented car.



**General comments about Disney World Accomodation:**

I stayed at All Star Movies Resort which along with the other All Stars is fairly budget compared to other hotels. 

Overall impression:

* The food is not great but if you're only there to have breakfast and are eating out otherwise then it's fine. I couldn't imagine having more than 1 meal a day here.
* Transportation is great - they have quite frequent (every 15 to 30 mins) shuttle buses to each of the major parks
* Have basic amenities, such as shops with medicine, quick food supplies, hats etc...
* My one criticism off this place is the level of sound you can hear from neighbours can be a lot, particularly when you have a young family next door which you probably will! Partly because of this, I struggled to get a decent sleep which really didn't help... I probably wouldn't stay here again because of this.

**General comments about Disney World Parks:**

I'm in my 30s so I wasn't sure how I'd find Disney World, but I had a really positive experience. I'm not a massive rollercoaster person so the rides at Disney were for the most part a good balance between being scary/exciting and being approachable and more fun for someone who isn't into crazy rides.

Favourite rides: The seven dwarfs, Pirates of the Carribean, Haunted Mansion (all in magic kingdom).

In addition to the rides, the parks do musical events, parades, and other events which are really nostalgic.

Favourite attraction/event: Fantasmic in Hollywood Studios. This and the Magic Kingdom fireworks evening show do such a great job of making all these invented world and characters come alive and making you part of it.

IMO this was the highlight of my Orlando leg.

  
**General comments about Miami:**

Quite expensive in comparison to similar places in London. I found it easy to be spending almost 100 dollars on a meal.

South Beach is quite walkable, but in comparison the rest of Miami is not really walkable.



**General comments about Florida**

**Transportation**

I always forget when I come to the USA how much more car oriented the cities are. Even in Miami which had some walkable areas (e.g. South Beach), the streets feel much less friendly to pedestrians versus a European city.

When I stayed in All Star Movies in Disney World, I saw there was a streak restaurant about 15 mins walk away in principle, but there was literally no way you could walk there because of the way the surrounding area is built (e.g. due to having to cross dual carriageways with no pedestrian crossings or no sidewalks).

I did research transportation options and decided Uber would be my primary mode of getting around (e.g. from Disney World accomodation to Kennedy Space Centre, and getting around Miami, and to and from airports). Overall this was fairly cost effective and much less hassle than trying to rent a car when I don't drive at all in London. I'd definitely recommend this for others.

On getting from Orlando to Miami, there is a train called the Brightline which is in general much better than what most US states. This is a very cost effective way of getting from North to South Florida so again would recommend this (paid about 70 dollars for a ticket, 3.5 hours travel time).  


**Weather**

I travelled from late march to early april (after postponing my original trip planned in October 2024) and the weather was great (high 20s Celcius) and not too humid.

I'd definitely recommend planning your Florida trip to avoid the more humid months or hurricane risky months which you can research online.



**Other Comments:**

As I said I caught a cold the day before my flight and it wasn't so bad that I felt the need to cancel completely. I powered through but it did still make it tough to enjoy the trip as much, particularly in Miami.

The flights in particular are brutal with a cold - not only do you feel the normal dehydrating and potential nausea but you can get the painful pressure effect on your ears and forehead due to being congested during ascent and descent. 

I recommend having at least 1/3 litre of water to drink before ascent and before descent to ease the congestion as well as the usual decongestants - the water basically gets rid of any potential pain.



**Overall:**

Travelling in the USA is always interesting and different. I've used to London urban planning and have been to Italy/Spain/Greece/France/Thailand/Japan and overall I find it much more comfortable and easy to navigate in the pedestrianised and public transport heavy cities like Rome or Tokyo.

Walking around parts of Miami in particular it just feels sort of soul less some times with the lack of people on the streets as everyone is in cars. Again, just my personal experience.

  
Would definitely go again to Miami to have a more exciting trip, doing more water activities, hopefully without being congested and jetlagged next time!",2,0.75,2,2025-04-05 17:48:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1js95vi/trip_report_8_days_solotravel_in_florida_from_the/,Ok-Bug8833
travel,1js8ixr,Portugal & Spain in May/June,"Like the title, I am traveling to Portugal and Spain from mid-May to mid-June. Looking for some tips especially for the Spain portion. This trip opportunity came spur of the moment and my brain is feeling fried trying to decide what to see!
Any thoughts/tips are greatly appreciated.
Below is not so much an itinerary as much as it is a list of ideas.

I’m interested in soaking up as much culture as I can. Art, architecture, food, beaches and hiking. I enjoy live music, nightlife & dancing but I don’t drink anymore so the party scene isn’t a focus necessarily.  


I fly into Porto and have 10 days to get to Lisbon.
I thought about doing a 2-3 day portion of the Camino de Santiago but in the opposite direction (towards Lisbon) and wonder if it will be “worth it”? 
Coimbra comes highly suggested and once in Lisbon I’d like to do a day trip to Sintra.
This keeps me pretty inland so if there are other towns/villages you suggest to see or something along the coast that is a must please let me know!

Once in Lisbon I fly to the Azores for 1 week for a retreat so this portion is already planned out.

When back in Lisbon in late May I then have 2+ weeks to do Spain. I don’t have a return flight yet so one thought is I could boogie from Lisbon up to San Sebastián > Barcelona > Andalucía > back to Lisbon for return flight
OR Lisbon > Andalucía > Barcelona > San Sebastián > Madrid or Porto for return flight

I’d like to see Andalucía - Seville, Córdoba, Granada, and Malaga all get recommended - how do I decide?? Is Gribaltar worth getting to?
San Sebastián & Barcelona are both on my list. 
Madrid I’ve heard mixed reviews about. Many say it is a must but some say they preferred Barcelona so maybe it can be skipped? It’s a nice halfway point from Andalucía though so it could be easily done, I’m sure. 
Are there any towns less traveled that I’m missing out on?


Thank you in advanced for your input!

travel,1js4dgv,Bus (ABE) to EWR for international flight to HND help,"Hi! 

I am flying out of ABE to Japan and the route requires we take a bus from ABE to Newark prior to flying out. For whatever reason, the ticket was $400 cheaper per person if we took the bus, rather than just the same route going out of Newark. Apparently, they really want people to ride their bus.

  
The question is, should I still get to ABE \~3 hours early for an international flight? Or would this not be needed because Newark is the international portion, and it would be okay to get there \~2 hours in advance? ABE is a smaller airport and it's normally quick relative to the larger airports. It is a 6 AM bus time so being able to get a little more sleep would be great if we can.

travel,1jrsynp,Grand Canyon or Yosemite??,"Grand Canyon or Yosemite??

A few things to consider when reading:
We will be going early October, maybe sooner depending on what you all say about the weather (but I chose early October in hopes that it will not be too hot or too cold at either place, whichever is decided).
We do plan on swimming at a few rivers and waterfalls at either place. 
Rental car costs are not a factor because my friend who is going with will be picking us up. 
We do love the outdoors and camping, but we will be training a lot over the next 6 months to make sure we are in good shape for either trip.  
I am including a rough itinerary and financial plan for both choices just to help out a little. 

Now that all of that is out of the way, I am struggling so damn hard and NEED all y'alls help!!!! 

Just a small backstory to get things rolling: I went to the Grand Canyon a couple years back, I rented a bike and rode along the rim to Hermits Rest and back, it was so fucking awesome. I also drove out to Hoover Dam and Alamo, NV to see Area 51. It was such an amazing trip. 

Current Day: My bf and I are planning a trip to go back out West in October and we invited a really good friend of ours to tag along, he lives out there and he offered to drive us so we could avoid paying for a rental car. The original plan was to make the same trip as I did a few years back, plus my bf and friend have never seen any of those sights I visited, so that would make it even better. BUT, this time I want to hike down to the Colorado River and camp for a few nights. I also wanted to camp at Havasu, but the cost is just not in my budget as of right now. I do plan on making a trip back to the Grand Canyon, hopefully in the next couple of years to camp on the Havasupai Reservation though. Realizing that we wouldn't be able to do Havasu this time around, I got super bummed and my friend (who is going with us) then suggested Yosemite, neither I or my bf have visited Yosemite, but my friend has and he loved it. However, they both told me that it is up for me to decide since it'll be a birthday trip, but both places are insanely beautiful just from photos, but the Grand Canyon has my heart lol. 

The cost of doing the Grand Canyon trip will cost roughly $1200 - $1700 including flights, hotels, souvenirs, etc.
The cost of Yosemite will be around the same maybe a bit less because we won't be spending any on hotels or restaurant food, we will just be camping the whole week in Yosemite. 

With these two options, which would you choose and why?
Again, we do want to swim and possibly fish, so if you have been to either park in late September/early October, how was the water?

If you recommend one park over the other, which campground(s) is/are your favorite?",2,1.0,22,2025-04-05 02:10:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jrsynp/grand_canyon_or_yosemite/,MadLilChild

travel,1jqv4ow,Thoughts on this Itinerary for 14 days in Peru?,"Hi everyone,

I'm going to Peru in the fall for 14 days, and I have a bad habit of overestimating how much I can do in a day. I'm hoping to get some opinions on my itinerary so I can go at a much more reasonable and less frantic pace.

I have to mention that I sit at a desk all day, so when I go on vacation, I walk a lot (ex., 30k steps a day). I'm not a lay-on-the-beach vacationer; I just don't want to overwhelm myself with too much sightseeing per day. Does that make sense?

**So here it goes:**  
Day 1–3: Land in Lima, Fly to Cusco

Day 4: Rainbow Mountain

Day 5-7: Explore Sacred Valley on the way to Ollantaytambo

Day 8–11: Inca Trail, Return to Cusco

Day 12: Another small day hike??

Day 13–14: Fly back to Lima, explore Lima

Day 15: Fly home in the morning

Im coming to the Philippines for 15 nights April/May.
Its our third trip to the Philippines, we've already been to Palawan and Siargao.

Initial plan was 9 nights Siquijor and 6 nights Panglao/Bohol, but i'm starting to consider splitting the trip into three 5-day stays on different Islands.

If we decided to do that, what would be your recommendation, where to go?
We absolutely loved Port Barton and its laid-back vibe, General Luna was exciting (we loved live-music bar-hopping every evening and the big choice of daytime activities), and I'd say El Nido was the worst of the above (too crowded).

Is there any other nearby destination that we could add to our plan? We are not much into snorkelling and hiking (that's why we skipped Coron), we enjoy island/beach hopping, so basically looking for a beach vacation with some good vibe, music and food options for the evening. Boracay and resort-ish vacation is not our style. I like to keep in simple, basic beach bungalows are my favourite 🫶🏼

Hi! I’m planning a solo trip for 2.5 weeks to Italy August 25th to September 11 starting in Rome. I have a rough Itinerary of cites i want to visit but open to any suggestions.

A little bit about me and my  interests -- this is my first time in Italy so I’d love to hit some of the major tourist attractions while I’m here ie Pisa, Colosseum, Duomo, Lake Como, etc.

Im a huge foody! This is one of the main reasons for my trip. Definitely looking for unique and authentic restaurants or street vendors that aren't too tourist trappy. I’d love to eat like the locals do. My price point is flexible, I’d like to keep it around $$ but could sneak in a few $$$$/michelin star experiences if highly recommended.

As much as i love the city, i also really enjoy being outdoors, historical sites, museums,in the countryside, or on a beach somewhere. I’m thinking that we'll stay in the cities as our home base and travel around the nearby area if i want to do any hiking, wine trips, coastal beach towns etc. I definitely want to see Lake Como and potentially go out to see the Dolomites. Is this a good strategy?

As for domestic travel, to bounce between city to city, i was thinking of purchasing a Eurail One Country Pass for Italy. Is this worth it or should i consider another form of travel? Also, not sure if this pass includes sleeper trains and I’d like really like to save daylight by leveraging sleeper trains to get from one place to another.

Lastly, for accommodations, I was thinking of using AirBnB or hotels for the entire stay across the country.

This is my itinerary at the moment

Flying landing into Rome on the 25th (5 nights)
Amalfi Coast (4 nights)
With a day drip to Pompeii
Florence (2-3 nights)
Venice (2-3 nights)
I’m flying out of Rome
Only thing missing is Sicily or Athens Greece :(.        which I really want to sneak in. For Sicily (thinking Palermo and/or Catania) 
Ideally, I'd like to have everything booked and reserved before i get out there.

Some questions and additional notes for you all:

Do you see any fat on the itinerary I should trim? Or do you think I am overcrowding things?
Any useful tip and tricks we should know about Italy?
Food and attraction recommendations are welcome :)

I currently have Oia/santorini 4/19-4/24 then chora/Mykonos 4/24-5/1 planned, but I just saw that many shops and beach activities won’t be open. I was hoping to possibly spend time on a beach or at least a heated pool if it’s a bit cool there. I worry about the weather and possibly a lack of things for me to do because of the closures

Is it still worth visiting those places now? I was also considering Capri/Positano/tuscany, but I heard the paths are much more narrow/steep and rocky and it won’t be very lush at that time. I’m also open to other suggestions, but Italy and Greece are dream destinations of mine. I also heard the French Riviera is gorgeous

travel,1jozi3y,France Regional Train Passes,"Hi all,  
  
I am looking to travel in France this Summer (June) and have questions about regional train passes. For some reason these are very hard to find.

  
I was able to find the following:

* Normandy Discovery Pass. But this works for weekends only. Is there another pass that works for the entire week? 
* Remi Discovery Pass for the Loire Valley 
* Occitania Rail Tour Pass 
* Regional SUD Pass for the Provence and Cote D'Azur regions. 

Are there passes for other areas that I'm missing? I couldn't find anything that covers Normandy during the week, or anything for the Hauts-de-France, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, Nouvelle-Aquitaine, or Bourgogne-Franche-Comté regions.  
  
Additionally, as far as I know, there is no whole country train pass other than Eurail France, please correct me if I'm wrong.

  
Any help is very much appreciated! Along with your experiences with using any of these passes.

**Background:** 30's, very active, no kids. Looking to relax by the beach/pool and enjoy good food and drinks. We enjoy going out to nice restaurants and cocktails, but we are not really into fine dining.



* **Price:** Zemi is \~$2k cheaper over 6 nights. Is the Malliouhana worth the extra cost in terms of resort quality, service, location, etc.? (Comparing similar rooms - both Ocean View w/ balconies)
* **Location:** Malliouhana seems to win based on location in Meads Bay. When people say taxis are expensive, how expensive are we talking? Rough estimate - how much would a taxi cost from Zemi to Meads Bay for dinner? 
* **Beaches:** I've read mixed reviews - for those who have been to both Meads Bay and Shoal Bay, which beach do you prefer?  
* **Food/Drinks:** How do the restaurants and bars at each resort compare? Do either stand out for cocktails and casual (but good) dining?

I'm planning a 3 weeks trip to South Africa at the end of July and would like some advice on my itinerary and safety. We will be traveling without a guide, my girlfriend and I. Here's my plan:

* Start from Johannesburg Airport with a rental car and drive to Sabie/Graskop (then Blyde River Canyon on the next day).
* Spend a few days in Kruger National Park.
* Visit eSwatini for 2 days (around Lobamba - actually 1 full day because of the driving time).
* Head to Hluhluwe-Infolozi Park/St. Lucia, then Durban (quick strop between St. Lucia and the Drakensberg).
* Do some day hiking in the Drakensberg (South Africa side)
* Head back to Johannesburg

Is it safe to do this itinerary? Ie Some people seem to recommend to fly directly to Kruger park...

Also, is it okay to hike in the Drakensberg without a group (just the two of us)?

Of course, we won't be driving at night, do our best to stay on the main roads and read about general safety in SA (windows closed, smash and grab, etc.)

travel,1joqqv2,Traveling to Taiwan with controlled medicines?,"I'm traveling through Taiwan with a couple controlled medicines.. namely ADHD medicines and Clonazepam. My understanding was that up to 6 months of prescribed medicines for personal use is allowed?

I made the ""mistake""(?) of emailing Taiwan Customs with questions about my ADHD meds and now they have me confused. They sent me a link to this page: [https://www.fda.gov.tw/ENG/lawContent.aspx?cid=5061&id=3079](https://www.fda.gov.tw/ENG/lawContent.aspx?cid=5061&id=3079) where it talks about printing out and physically mailing a list of documents to Taiwan.

My trip is in LESS than one week and of course there would not be time to mail documents to Taiwan from North America.

I'm confused what to do. Are there any issues with traveling to Taiwan with ADHD meds and Clonazepam? I'm sure many travelers are traveling with these meds. I'm confused why they sent me a link to mail physical documents to Taiwan and there doesn't seem to be any online system like Japan and Singapore has.

Just to be clear: I have medicines prescribed by U.S doctors that I need for travel. I have the prescriptions, the original containers, and letters from doctors explaining what the medicines are for. I shouldn't need to submit documents for certificate, right?

travel,1joke4f,This might be the first time I'm traveling without camping gear! So excited for my Italy/Dolomiti trip + questions,"Detailed itinerary below but the second half of our 2 and a half weeks trip will be dedicated to hiking the Alta via 1. End of July/early August. My SO and I learned that we were supposed to book our rifugios in January...at about the time we were starting to look at rifugios bookings 😅 By some miracle, I swear, we finally managed to book all of our rifugios this weekend except 2, we'll keep looking. Couldn't find anything the weekend before that. I'm super duper grateful, otherwise it would have been complicated to do this hike. I'm so excited to not have to carry around an enormous backpack in the scorching sun, and eat boring shelf stable food every night, for once!!!! (I adore camping, but we do a lot of that already, we were totally in for a light-carry hiking trip) 

I will have a few questions on different subjects at the end, if you can help me out with the few things I still struggle to figure out! 

And as usual I'm always open and looking for your amazing recommendations on spots we shouldn't miss out :) 

We are landing in Rome in the morning and that first day we might not do much or at least we gave ourselves a ""chilling"" day just in case. Probs for browsing around the cafes and restaurants. Second day Coloseum, Crypts/catacombs. 
Third day we bus to Naples to visit Pompei, and Herculanum if we find the time.
We spend the night in Naples and the next day we're going for a day trip to Capri island for sightseeing, walking around and check out the Garden of Augustus. And some beach time too. Ferry lin the evening of this fourth day and back to Naples. 

From Naples we will take the train in the morning of day 5 to Florence. Spend the night and most of the next day there, but we'll be taking a train in the PM to reach Venice around dinner. We have a looooovely airbnb right on the island of Venice, little terrace with a view, can you even believe it was less expensive than the hostel we were first going for in Mestre !! Two nights booked in Venice, visiting days 7 and most of 8. 

Day 8 is still a bit blurry as we are waiting for a rifugio to become available at the very first stop on our Dolomiti hike ; either we find one and therefore leave Venice late in the day to spend the night in Belluno, or we might start the hike a day after and instead do a huge stretch to reach our first booked rifugio in a single day (about 10hours from trail head) 😬
Anyway, if all goes according to plan, on day 9 we should begin 

~Alta via 1 of the Dolomiti~
We're doing it backwards from Belluno ! It's what made the most sense for us. 

We are hiking for day 9 (working on Bianchet/Pian de Fontana/Pramperet still..) , 10 (to Carestiato), 11 (Coldai), 12 (Passo Stolanza), 13 (still working on Passo Giau..) ,14 (Dibona) and on day 15th we'll most likely have to do a biiiiig stretch from Rif Dibona (close to the road to Cortina D'ampezzo, near/before? Lagazuoi) to rif Pederu in a single day (10hrs?), to catch a night bus going to Rome (at least we hope to find one!) 
This is because we are really at the end of our trip and are coming short on time, flying from Rome to home in Canada (not without a layover, of course! Shrugs at my partner's attempt to save 100 ish bucks) in early afternoon on day 17th. 

So we unfortunately won't be hiking the last little stretch to Braies, but I think it will be more than enough to amaze us! I'm honestly jumping around just thinking about this adventure.

But if I may inquire to anyone who would happen to know...
1- We accidentally booked only a single bed / spot in Carestiato, when we thought it was available for 2! I booked it anyway and we really need that spot, nothing else  around...from experience do you think it will be fine if we show up and if there are no more beds, we ask to sleep in the same bed?(we're both very lean so not the best but better than the floor lol) Most importantly, will both of us get dinner , or is everything calculated tightly? 

2-I've never driven outside of my country(province, actually), a bit nervous to do so. But if I were to rent a car let's say near rifugio Pederu, or in Cortina D'ampezzo, can I drive to Rome and..leave it there? How do these things work? Would it be crazy expensive? Or even almost dangerous for that route length if I'm inexperienced with European roads? 

3- please let me know about your favorite local-owned and low key/mooost authentic restaurants in Rome, Naples, Florences
 and Venice ! As well as little known spots easy to miss out on that we can add to our bucket list. We don't have a big food budget at this point, but we could indulge on something more fancy for one or two nights out of the trip, though. And we love more rustic spots too.

[Option one](https://www.patagonia.com/product/terravia-mini-hip-pack-1-liter/49448.html?dwvar_49448_color=SMDB)

Pros

* Will fit everything minus camera (girlfriend has one where I tested this out)
* Cheaper
* Can swing bag around in the front and have easy view of everything

Cons

* Smaller
* Has clasp that can easily be snapped off

[Option two](https://www.patagonia.com/product/atom-sling-bag-8-liters/48262.html?dwvar_48262_color=SLPU)

Pros 

* Can fit everything plus camera, plus anything else I buy while on the street
* No clasp
* Zippers has loop that can put carabiner to reduce chance of picketpocket

Cons

* No front view (unsure if feels comfortable if swinging to the front) probably the biggest case against it

travel,1job5i4,USA Road trip advice,"Hi, we are planning to do a road trip in the US, going from San Francisco to Yellowstone, with a duration of approximately three weeks. The thing is that we have some doubts, because it is a really long trip, and we are not sure if it is going to be too much road, or if there will be days where we are going to see a whole lot of nothing. 

We were planning on doing stops at least in las vegas and bryce/zion parks.

Do you consider the itinerary feasible/reasonable? After Yellowstone, which airport would be best for a flight back to Europe? I was thinking maybe Denver or Seattle, but both of them seem to be really far away from Yellowstone. 

And last, do you consider this a good trip for foreign tourists in the US? I went to New York a few years ago, but I assume this is quite different.

Edit:

Thanks for all the advice! We didn't want to eliminate SF (we are already sacrificing things we liked, like Yosemite), but taking a flight from SF to LV is something we hadn't considered and it saves us a day. We are already looking into it.

Also, it looks like SLC is well conected, and being a bigger airport will probably lower the fee for leaving the car in a different airport. Besides, the ~5 hour drive from Yellowstone to SLC would be acceptable.

However, we have 7 nights and I’m wondering if this will be too much time in the city. I’d love to visit the beaches on the Pacific coast but I’m wary of losing two days to travel on such a short trip. I also don’t want to feel rushed during our time in the city. The general consensus among travelers asking the same questions is that a week is definitely not too long to explore the city and surrounding areas - do folks here agree? And if so, what are some potential day trips/surrounding areas to explore that don’t require a group tour? We are open to private guides but generally don’t enjoy group excursions.

As a result, I filled out the Property Irregularity Report and am now waiting for updates from easyJet.

It has been six days, and I have not received any response (email or phone call).

I am not sure how it works in Europe, but in Brazil, I have experienced lost luggage before, and here, it is possible to take legal action and receive compensation for the inconvenience.

I had to spend the last three days of my trip wearing the same clothes. From what I researched, I could have bought clothes, and easyJet would have reimbursed me, but since it was the end of my trip, I didn’t have the chance. I arrived in Barcelona at night and was leaving for Brazil the next morning. When I arrived in São Paulo also at night, I only stayed at a hotel to sleep because I had another flight to my city early the next day, leaving no time to buy clothes.

So, I would like to understand how this works in Europe. From my research, most cases mention reimbursement for expenses due to lost luggage, but I haven’t seen anything about compensation for the loss of the bag itself.

Regarding travel insurance, I purchased one, and from what I’ve seen, I have to wait 21 days before I can file a claim for the lost bag.",2,1.0,6,2025-03-31 12:50:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jo2eyh/lost_luggage_in_europe_how_does_compensation_work/,Individual-Cut3998

In October (2nd half), I am planning to visit the US for the first time with my wife. Our first destination is LA (as we have some friends living there), the holiday lasts about 14 days (+- a few days if needed).

However, whenever we have a long-haul flight, I have a good experience with breaking it up and adding an extra stop (number of days TBD).

Therefore, I am considering making a stop somewhere in the eastern part of the US.

I am a big fan of Halloween and everything spooky. I was considering a stop in Boston and travelling to Salem, but the internet research showed that it gets overcrowded at that time of the year.

Another consideration is New York (they say the city is beautiful in Autumn) and also visiting Sleepy Hollow, but it too is likely to have way too many visitors during that season.

Any good advice on a stop idea? Maybe somewhere where it's not that crowded. Anything: haunted houses, amusement parks, etc

I am also interested in nature, country music, food, movie history (but guess, LA could cover that).",2,0.75,7,2025-03-30 20:19:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jnlkol/itinerary_advice_flying_from_europe_to_la_around/,Local_Challenge_1698

We typically get up early and pack a lot into our days. Right now we're looking at staying in:

Edinburgh for 2-3 nights.

Inverness for 2 nights followed by a day in Isle of Skye (haven't many options to stay on the Isle so may have to do it in a day)

Either Fort William or Glencoe (my sense is that Fort William has more lodging/dining options than Glencoe) for 2 nights

travel,1jnhaoh,Planning Madagascar in May – Fly to Morondava for Baobabs & Tsingy or full road trip? + Route feedback?,"Hi everyone! 👋  
My girlfriend and I are planning a 3-week trip to Madagascar in **May 2025**, and we’d love your input – especially from locals or travelers who’ve done similar trips. We're planning to rent a **car with a driver**, and are also looking for **recommendations for reliable drivers or agencies**.

# Our trip:

* **Arrival in Antananarivo:** May 1
* **Departure:** May 24 at 14:30 from Tana

# Flights already booked:

* **May 9:** Tana → Île Sainte-Marie (09:00 AM)
* **May 13:** Île Sainte-Marie → Tana → Nosy Be (arrival \~14:00)
* **May 22** ***or*** **23 (still deciding):** Nosy Be → Tana (arrival \~23:00)

# Option 1: Fly to Morondava (May 3–8)

We’re thinking about flying to **Morondava on May 3** to visit:

* 🌳 **Baobab Avenue** (top priority!)
* 🏞️ **Tsingy de Bemaraha** (also a must for us)

We’d return to **Tana on May 8** and stay overnight for our Sainte-Marie flight the next morning.  
**May 1–2** would be used for a visit to **Andasibe National Park**, including a **night walk in the rainforest**.

# Option 2: Full Road Trip (May 1–8, no domestic flights)

Instead of flying, we’d do a **complete road trip by car with a driver**.  
This route is based on the places we’d love to see – but we’re unsure what’s realistically possible and would **really appreciate your honest feedback** or route adjustments!

# Wishlist (flexible):

* **Andasibe** (rainforest, night walk)
* **Ranomafana**
* **Isalo**
* **Baobab Avenue (Morondava)**
* (*Optional:* **Antsirabe**, if time allows)
* Tsingy probably wouldn’t fit in this version – and that’s okay

# Our current draft itinerary for Option 2:

|**Date**|**Route**|**Notes**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**May 1**|Tana → Andasibe|Afternoon: arrive & night walk |
|**May 2**|Andasibe → Ranomafana|Long drive day|
|**May 3**|Ranomafana NP|Full day hike|
|**May 4**|Ranomafana → Isalo|Long drive|
|**May 5**|Isalo NP|Hike & relax|
|**May 6**|Isalo → Morondava|Long drive|
|**May 7**|Baobab Avenue|Sunset 🌅|
|**May 8**|Morondava → Tana|Long drive |

We’re worried this **might be too rushed** – what do you think?  
Is it realistic or should we drop something? We want to **enjoy the experience**, not just check off places.

# Our open questions:

1. Is it **worth flying to Morondava just for Baobabs & Tsingy**, or would we miss out on more diverse nature experiences?
2. Is **Tsingy accessible in early May**, or still too muddy/slow?
3. Does **Option 2 seem realistic**, or too exhausting? What would you cut or change?
4. Would you include **Antsirabe** if time allows – or skip it entirely?
5. Are there **trusted agencies or driver recommendations** for a 7–8 day trip like this?
6. Is it risky to drive **back to Tana on May 8**, the day before our Sainte-Marie flight (May 9 at 09:00)?
7. We’re still deciding whether to fly back from Nosy Be on **May 22 or 23** (both arrive \~11 PM) – would you prioritize **more time on Nosy Be or more margin in Tana** before the international flight?

# After May 9:

* **May 9–13:** Île Sainte-Marie – flexible, no plans yet
* **May 13–23:** Nosy Be – relaxing, possibly diving and island hopping
* **May 22 or 23:** Back to Tana for final night(s)

Thanks so much for reading and for any thoughts or advice – we really want to make the most of this trip without burning out!

Jetblue is $100 more.

From my initial research, Alaska has no TV but you can connect your device to watch things. Also, meals or snacks have to be pre-ordered? Or are snacks included?

Does Jetblue still give snacks?

I have noticed that no airlines include checked luggage now unless you’re first class.

Are seat spacing the same between my two choices? I am small anyway so not much of an issue.

Based on your comments we have decided to drop TDP (not enough time and not enough daylight time, weather) and have decided to focus on Rapa Nui and Atacama this trip (hoping there will be more in the future). Here is the tentative itinerary.

Day 1, 15th: Land in SCL 7 am, relax, see some of the city later on in the day

Day 2, 16th fly to Calama CJC Leave SCL 9 am, reach CJC 1130 am

Stay 16, 17, 18 nights Atacama area so 2 full days

Day 5, 19th fly back to SCL, leave CJC 10 am, reach SCL 1230 pm, spend time in Santiago pm

Day 6 20th fly to Rapa Nui IPC, leave SCL 11 am, reach IPC 230 pm

Stay 20, 21, 22, 23 nights on Rapa Nui so 3 full days

Day 10, 24th fly to Santiago, leave IPC at 230 pm, reach SCL at 9 pm

Day 11, 25th, spend am to early pm in Santiago, leave SCL at 8 pm for return

I’m not much of a swimmer either, but I love being near the ocean: waking up, sitting under a palapa, sipping a drink, watching the sunrise and sunset, waves in the background. That kind of vibe.

I’m basically still recovering, so I’m looking for something really relaxing. Not super active or busy. Just sun, quiet, and nice scenery.

A little background: I’ve traveled to over 50 countries, mostly in the Middle East and Africa. So while I’m not new to travel at all, the Caribbean isn’t somewhere I’ve explored as much. The last time I went was about two years ago, so planning a beach trip like this honestly feels a little rusty for me. I’m kind of re-diving into it, and realizing that planning a Caribbean trip is a whole different mindset.

Places I’ve been and liked:
- Turks and Caicos: Loved it. White sand, clear water, super chill hotel-focused vacation.
- Roatán: Also amazing. Beautiful beaches, great food, amazing snorkeling culture fun nightlife.
- Puerto Rico: Amazing food, but it felt a bit too much like Miami with the crowd and social scene.
- Bahamas: Not really my vibe. It felt very party-heavy and packed. But, full disclosure, I stayed in Nassau.
- Colombia (Caribbean side): Cool to visit, but again, very catered to tourists.

We were thinking about Belize at first, but from what I’ve seen online, the beach scene didn’t seem as relaxing or picturesque as I expected. Where are the sands?? lol

Now we’re looking at Aruba. It seems promising with lots of hotel options along the strip, great and beautiful beaches, access to good food, and it looks pretty easy to get around. We’re planning to rent a car, but it also looks super walkable near Eagle and Palm Beach, which I like. I don’t like being stuck in a hotel the whole time, so having things nearby is a plus.

Just wondering if anyone here has thoughts on Aruba or other suggestions for Caribbean destinations that are chill, beautiful, and not super crowded, but still accessible enough for someone like my partner who’s never left the country before.

We’re planning to go in the next month or so. Appreciate any input!

travel,1jm43g8,Lake Atitlan where to stay for 2 women in their 30s,"Hey All! 

I have been down the rabbit hole on here and trip advisor and I can’t seem to nail down the best place for us. So I figured I would just ask directly with a little more info and see if someone can help. 

My friend and I are going to Lake Atitlan at the end of the month. We are both in our mid-30s. So our parting days are behind us, but we will enjoy a couple drinks after dinner. And likely call it a night around 10ish. 

We are only spending 3 days so we want to pick one area to stay and stick with it as our home base. 

Originally we thought for just 3 days, perhaps panajachel, but we think it will be too touristy and busy. We are seasoned travelers and like to avoid main tourist hubs for more than maybe half a day. 

The more we read we thought San Pedro may fit the bill then. We still want to be able to walk around and get water taxis to other places easily. But about every hotel review has a bunch of reviews saying something along the lines of “the music from the bars outside was so loud and unbearable.” And as we no longer party, this concerns us. 

Santa Cruz seems the most up our alley as far as the hotels and quieter/simpler and a bit more in nature, but it seems maybe a bit too quiet. Everything I’ve read seems to agree, if it’s your first time and want to walk around at all or pop around to other areas, this isn’t the place for you. Seems everyone who stays in Santa Cruz just stays there and relaxes. 

Can someone give me some insight if you’re around my age and have similar taste? Thank you in advance !!",2,1.0,14,2025-03-28 19:58:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jm43g8/lake_atitlan_where_to_stay_for_2_women_in_their/,mka1809

The options are 4 days (3.5 days) or 6 days. Are 4 days enough to see most of the attractions or we should pick the 6 days option.

We want to additionally visit Matera, Altamura and Alberobello and here comes my additional question.

What is the situation with the public transport in there? Like in Bari and between the towns. 

When I visited Rome it's obviously different, but I'm guessing in cities that are far away from the capital the situation there might be a lot harder to move around.

Some background: My wife and I (early 30s, not avid hikers but can do light and short 2-3h+ trails with little elevation. I love wine, she doesn't drink. we love food!) went on our honeymoon to NZ last April-May and are so enamoured of the country that we are already planning a trip back this late November - early December, specially to see the lupins (yes, I know they are an invasive weed). Perhaps also cover some easy tracks that were closed last time out.

On last year's trip, we covered in the South: Queenstown, Te Anau, Milford Sound, Wanaka, Hawea, Mount Cook, Tekapo and Christchurch. We are not averse to seeing the same stuff (hence Mackenzie Basin again for the lupins), but are open to new things as well.

May I please ask for you to provide feedback on my itinerary below and any recommendations. 

Day 1: Land in Chch, overnight Chch.

Day 2: Drive to Hokitika via Arthur's Pass. Overnight Hokitika

Day 3: Explore around Hokitika - Pancake Rocks, Truman Track, Hokitika Gorge etc.

Day 4: Hokitka to Franz Josef / Fox Glacier.

Day 5: Glaciers

Day 6: Glaciers to Wanaka

Day 7: Wanaka - Rob Roy Glacier Track - please be open this time! Lavender Farm.

\*Day 8: Wanaka to Mount Cook

Day 9: Mount Cook - Kea Point, maybe explore some other tracks apart from Hooker Valley

Day 10: Mount Cook to Tekapo

Day 11: Tekapo - Mount John

Day 12: Tekapo to Christchurch, return car and fly home



\*I have one major dilemma as it stands - should I take an extra 3 days, starting from Day 8, to go from Wanaka -> 1N at Owaka/Curio Bay (\~4h) -> 2N at Dunedin (\~2h drive) -> Mount Cook (\~3.5h), to have a chance at exploring part of the south east (and hopefully spot some seals and sea lions) as well? This will increase the trip length to 14 days, as I look at cutting day 11 at Tekapo should I make this change.

Thank you so much, all!

Very much looking forward to be back.",2,1.0,6,2025-03-28 11:20:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jlsqq4/new_zealand_help/,Newbshuffler
travel,1jlrlht,Luggage forwarding in Japan,"Hello everyone,

How exactly does luggage forwarding work in Japan?

My wife and I will each have one large suitcase. During our trip, there will be two occasions when we want to explore the city in the morning/afternoon before traveling to our next destination later in the day. By that time, we will have already checked out and, of course, don’t want to carry around two large suitcases.

Specifically, this will happen once when traveling from Okayama to Kobe, as we plan to stop in Himeji to visit the castle. So, we’ll take the Shinkansen in the morning, stop in Himeji, and arrive in Kobe in the evening to check in at our Airbnb.

The second instance will be when traveling from Kyoto to Osaka. We want to explore Kyoto in the morning/afternoon and then travel to Osaka later in the day to check into our Airbnb.

Is it possible to send the suitcases in the morning (from Okayama and Kyoto) and pick them up at the station in the evening (Kobe and Osaka)? Or are they delivered directly to the accommodation?

Since we're staying in an Airbnb, there won’t be anyone available to receive the luggage.

I have nearly 4 days (3 nights) in [Lima](https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Tourism-g294316-Lima_Lima_Region-Vacations.html) and am thinking of doing a day trip to Paracas. It seems like several companies offer day-trips leaving early from Lima and returning late.

Day 1: Land in Lisbon around 12. Drop our bags at our hotel in the Alfama area. Walk around Baixa-Chiado / Bairro Alto. 

Day 2: Day trip to Sintra. Uber to Pena in the morning, check that our first. Aim to go to the Moorish Castle and Quinta da Regaleira. Is it worth the trek over to check out Cabo da Roca?

Day 3: Castelo de São Jorge in the morning. Lisbon food tour for lunch and walk around Alfama in the afternoon. Check out the Tile Museum if we have time.

Day 4: Explore Belem. Go to Jerónimos Monastery. Walk by Belem Tower (not planning on going in). Grab a pastry. Any recommendations for other stops in Belem? Stop by LX Factory on our way back into the city.

Day 5: Pick up our rental car in the morning, drive to Evora. Check out one of the megalith sites on our way in. Walk around Evora, check out the Temple of Diana and Chapel of Bones.

Day 6: Leave Evora, stop in Tomar and check out the Convent of Christ. In the afternoon go to Nazare. Walk along the beach, watch the waves and check out the cliffs.

Day 7: Go to Obidos in the morning until lunch. Then go to the Alcobaca Monastery. Debating if we should make time to go to Batalha as well? Or if there is one monastery of the two we should prioritize above the other? We're staying in Coimbra this night so drive over there once done seeing the sights.

Day 8: Morning tour of the Schist villages. Afternoon check out the University and Library.

Day 9: Visit the Conimbriga ruins. Head over to Porto potentially stopping by the Buçaco National Forest to walk around. Maybe also go to Aviero but not sure if the city is worth a stop? End in Porto and return rental car.

Day 10: Walking tour around Porto. Explore the city - any must dos? Debating whether we should get tickets for Livraria Lello. If we go at 9am will it be packed?

Day 11: Duoro Valley Tour

Day 12: Check out across the river and do a port tasting in Vila Nova de Gaia.

I’m heading back to Mexico for the first time in 10 years for my honeymoon! Last time, I absolutely *loved* Isla Holbox and Mazunte for their small, charming communities, beautiful beaches, and laid-back vibe. While I’d love to return, I want to explore *new* places that offer a similar mix of relaxation, nature, and Mexican culture.

**Some details about our trip:**

* We land in Cancún in April and fly out of Mexico City 16 days later.
* This time, we’re focusing more on the **Pacific coast, Western Mexico** and **Mexico City**, since I spent most of my trip in the East before.
* We both love **hiking and nature**, so if there are great trails near the coast, that’s a big plus!
* We also love the colourful mexican culture (I loved  San Cristóbal de las Casas too, but similarly I’d prefer not to repeat too much of my last itinerary).

**Looking for recommendations on:**

1. **Beach towns** similar to Holbox/Mazunte—small, charming, not too built up.
2. **Hiking/nature spots** that fit well into this itinerary.
3. Any hidden gems or cultural spots between the Pacific coast and Mexico City!

\- The reason I want to fly into Cancun is I would like to spend a short time in Tulum, as I want to catch a festival there, but I know it is touristy and not very authentic so I would not like the spend the majority of my holiday there  
\- I would like to experience the sealift and go snorkelling. I see there are areas in Cozumel that are apparently not touristy, so maybe there but open to better less busy options.   
\- I would like to go see one of the ruins  
\- I would like to experience a jungle, a trail or even visiting a ruin in the jungle (I would love to visit Palenque, but the travel always seems extremely long)

My query comes when thinking about months; everything tells me that September-November is a good time to visit, but I've got multiple choices within that. Some options would be late Sept-early Oct but more expensive to fly, with others mid to late Nov and less expensive.

Obviously it always comes down to personal preference, but I'm interested in people's personal preferences if they've managed to experience either or both. What's better and what's worse for each? The plan is about two weeks across Osaka/Kyoto/Tokyo.

travel,1jivlm5,Trip to Dublin via London: how best to book train and ferry?,"Good day everyone!

In May this year, me and my partner want to travel to and around Ireland by public transport. We've booked a train to London and want to do the trip from there to Dublin. I see there is a connection from London Euston to Holyhead and we want to take the ferry from there.

At first we were interested in this Sail & Rail Special by Irish Ferries, but I see these are unavailable to buy online according to the website. Does this maybe have something to do with the damage of the storm earlier this year? It is strange anyway, because it is possible for me to just book a regular ferry trip. Does anyone maybe know why this is?

Right now I am considering just booking the train at [nationalrail.co.uk](http://nationalrail.co.uk/) and booking the ferry at either [irishferries.com](http://irishferries.com/) or stenaline.com. However, I checked for the entire trip from London to Dublin on raileurope.com and up there they offer the entire trip for quite a bit less money than I would be paying for the first two bookings. I've booked on raileurope.com before and it was all fine and worked really well. I just don't understand how it can be so much cheaper. It would be a difference of about 60 Euros. So what's up with that? It does mention it would do the ferry with Wales Ferry instead of Irish Ferries or Stena?

Going on a 10 day trip to la Côte d'Azur (French Riviera) at the beginning of may.

Couple of questions :

We are thinking about staying in Nice for 5 days and taking day trips to nearby towns (Menton, Monaco, Eze...).

We are thinking about staying in a second city for 5 days. Saint-Tropez was our first choice. Anyone would recommend another city for ""base camp"" for 5 days ?

Another question that we have is how easy is it to move around the Côte d'Azur. It seems pretty easy to go from town to town in public transport. But if we were to stay a little bit out of town or in smaller towns, is possible to still go around by public transportation or a car is better ?

Is it a pain in the ass to have a car in this part of France ? Is parking easy ? We won't be in the biggest touristic season since we're gonna be there at the beginning of May.

For Tennesse I feel like there is so much to do but can get pretty pricey. I like the night life of Chattanooga and the abilty to walk around at night and see cool stores.

Day 2 - Jakarta  
Day 3 - 7h train to Yogakarta  
Day 4 - Yogakarta  
Day 5 - Travel day to Malang via Surabaya (long day)  
Day 6 - Malang  
Day 7, 8, 9 - Bromo + Ijen, finish in Banyuwangi  
Day 10 - Ferry + bus to DPS, Bali  
Day 11-14 : 4 nights in Ubud  
Day 15-18 : 4 nights in Gili islands  
Day 19-22 : 4 nights in Lombok  
Day 23-26 : 4 nights in Komodo  
Day 27-29 : Return to Bali, 3 nights in Uluwatu  
Day 30 : Depart Bali

Questions - here I am spending just a day in Jakarta and a day in Yogakarta, is this a waste of time to spend such little time there, will I be able to see anything at all or should I fly into Surabaya instead and add on days elsewhere to my itinerary?  The thought is that I could do Jakarya/Yogakarta on another trip if a day in each is not worth it.

travel,1k4u1bn,Need help planning 1-2 nights in Switzerland from Milan — overwhelmed with options!,"Need help planning 1-2 nights in Switzerland from Milan — overwhelmed with options!


Hi everyone!

I’ve thoroughly confused myself trying to plan a quick Switzerland trip and would love some help. I’ll be traveling with my parents (all adults, ages 25–55) from Australia — it’s our first time in Europe.

We’ll be leaving from Milan on either May 26 or 27 (flexible depending on what works best), and I want to spend 1, maybe 2 nights in Switzerland.

Originally, I was really keen on Grindelwald for the cable cars and the toboggan experience. But transport from Milan + accommodation in Grindelwald is turning out to be quite expensive.

I then looked at staying in Zurich instead, but the train journey is still pricey, and I feel like we might miss the classic mountain experience.

I also considered renting a car (my dad’s a confident driver), but I’m unsure how easy it is to drive and park in Grindelwald or other villages in the Jungfrau region.

Then I came across the Bernina Express, which looks amazing for scenic views — but then we’d miss out on the cable cars and alpine village feel.

To make things more confusing, I just listened to a podcast that mentioned lots of lesser-known villages in the Jungfrau region also have cable cars and scenic train access, and may be more peaceful (and maybe more affordable?). They suggested staying in Lauterbrunnen and taking cable cars, trains and/or busses to the nearby villages.

At this point, I’m just overwhelmed! We want a scenic Swiss experience, something iconic with a cable car or mountain view, ideally without breaking the bank. Would love any advice — suggested routes, places to stay, or even if it’s better to do something totally different!

Thanks in advance!",1,0.67,12,2025-04-22 01:10:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k4u1bn/need_help_planning_12_nights_in_switzerland_from/,CivilAlternative9302

travel,1k4hprp,Northern/Central Vietnam - 15 night itinerary - Couple - Mid 30s,"Hi,

I'm looking for some help with a 15 night itinerary, starting and ending in Hanoi, in May. I'm going with my wife for our honeymoon, so we're looking at things more on the luxury side of things as opposed to backpacker/solo travel which a lot of advice seems geared to.

In terms of things we enjoy, she enjoys the city and hussle and bustle, whereas I prefer to see more of the nature side of things - however neither of us is particularly adventurous! So doing something like the Ha Giang loop, which many people recommend, seems a bit of a stretch - neither of us ride motorbikes and some of the safety concerns seem a bit worrying to me! However we do want to avoid things which are super super touristy e.g manufactured purely for tourists and to sell you stuff

Places we've got on a short list to see so far are:

- Hanoi - 3 nights
- Lan Ha Bay cruise (maybe) - 2 nights
- Sapa (maybe) - 2 nights
- Ninh Binh - 1 (or 2) nights
- Hoi An - (? nights)
- Hue - (? nights)
- Da Nang (fly back to Hanoi)

I'm currently unsure about Sapa or the bay cruise - have read some mixed things about both in terms of how touristy they are.

My main concern with going to all these places is just how much time we'll spend travelling. We do still want to relax and have some time to spend in nice accomodation, as opposed to being on sleeper trains the whole time - but on the other hand most of the places don't necessarily seem like they have enough to do for more than a 3 night stay?

Would be great to get some advice on how to balance moving about constantly with staying put but not getting too bored!

I have an overseas flight from Paris ORLY to the States at 11:30AM on June 5. I need to get from Nice to Paris, and I’ve looked at trains, flights, and buses, and I’m conflicted about what to do. 

Flight: Easyjet 6:30 —> 8:00 AM. This is what I’m leaning towards because it takes me directly to the same airport. 3.5 hours should be enough time since I’m not checking in any bags. 

Train+bus: there’s a train+bus option that departs at 5pm the previous day and arrives at ORLY at 5:30AM June 5. Since it’s overnight, it can save me one night’s accommodation. However, I’m a little hesitant about changing from train to bus in the middle of the night, and I’m a young solo female traveler too. I also have a long international flight ahead, so I’m not thrilled about having a 24+ hour travel day.

Train: Or should I be extra cautious, get to Paris the previous day at 9PM and book accommodations? I don’t love this option because I’m pretty much wasting a day, and I’ll need to spend more on accommodations. 

So again, I’m leaning towards flying with Easyjet. Does anyone have experience with Easyjet? From my quick search, they do seem pretty reliable, and it’s an early flight. I’m just worried delays might happen.

travel,1k348if,That's my route.. for 3 countries. Need some useful advices,"Hey everyone,

I'm planning to visit three countries after May. My first stop is Tirana, Albania. From there, I plan to take a train to Belgrade. **I think I need to take a bus from Tirana to Bar, Montenegro, but I'm not sure about the details.(need help!)** 

After staying in Belgrade for about 5-7 days, I'll fly to Skopje, though I'm unsure how long I should stay there. My route should be the cheapest route  according to google flights! 

I'd appreciate some advice on how long to stay in each place to fully explore the countries. For example, is 3 days enough in Skopje, or is 1 week too much in Belgrade?

Btw,  I'm wondering about transportation options. **Does Uber work in these cities, or should I rely on public transport?** It would be a huge advantage of using  my phone to request rides and get charged automatically without worrying about the payments or getting scammed.

**In terms of taking the train from Bar to Belgrade, I think tickets can't be purchased online. Is that correct?**

travel,1k3178q,Best amazon trip in Peru: Iquitos vs Manu vs Tambopata,"Hi everyone,

I am currently in Peru and want to do a trip to the Amazon. Currently looking at minimum of a 4 night/5 day trip, happy to do a day or two more if budget allows (probably max out around $1000). 

Our initial research suggested Iquitos. However we are currently in Cusco, so rather then fly to Lima, then up to Iquitos, then back to Lima (our flights out of Peru are booked from Lima), we are now tempted more by Manu National Park or Tambopata, due to their (relative) proximity.

Can anyone tell us of their experiences in any of these respective places? 

We are not particularly interested in villages etc, the focus is very much on wildlife. We are experienced with trecking and are in good fitness, so somewhere less accessible would be ideal, because we don't want to be part of huge groups. We also are very keen on somewhere that is sustainable and does not bother the animals- we have 0 interest in places that bother animals to help tourists get pictures etc. 

Any advice or experiences would be appreciated (how you found an area, the tour provider you went with, animals you saw etc).

travel,1k30z03,I’d like to a NP and my mom wants to go to a beach—any ideas?,"Hi all, hope this is an ok subreddit to post this.

Shortly after my summer class ends on June 2nd, my family and I’d like to vacation. I suggested we go to a National Park, but my mom suggests we go to the beach.

I was thinking Ruby beach, but my mom wants warm weather and tanning. Washington can be cold so it seemed like a no go maybe. We have always gone to the beach during our once a year vacation (even if I don’t like it), and it’s usually always Florida or Georgia, or somewhere there.

I don’t mind driving an hour-2 hours to get the NP if it requires me to do so since I’m only one interested in hiking. 

A couple of important notes: 
- I’m based in TN
- My mom is disabled and uses a walking stick to get around, so if were to do a beach in a national park it’d have to be accessible (which is why I’m thinking a separate beach and NP might just be easier)
- This trip would be a week long and sometime after my class ends June 2nd. 
- I’d like to stay in the US but i’m open to international.

travel,1k2k2iq,Qantas/Jetstar lost our bags on a 4-day trip booked with Amex Travel — no answers after 2 days in KL,"Hi all,

My partner and I are currently in Kuala Lumpur and we still don’t have our checked luggage — it’s been two full days since we landed. I wanted to share our experience in case anyone’s been through something similar or can offer advice.

We booked this trip through Amex Travel in March using about $1,800 in flight credit that was expiring in June. We didn’t have many good options unless we traveled domestically, so we decided to spend more and turn it into a short international trip. In total, we paid around $4,000. Amex also added about $100 on top of the Qantas listed price, apparently due to travel insurance.

The flights were:
Perth → Singapore (Qantas)
Singapore → KL (Jetstar, operated by Qantas)

When we landed in KL on April 17 around 9 PM, our luggage didn’t come out. We waited until the belt stopped and confirmed with baggage services — nothing. We called both Qantas and Jetstar on the spot, but they basically pointed fingers at each other. Couldn’t contact Amex Travel because their support had already closed for the day.

We’ve had to buy essentials just to get by — I bought underwear, socks, a shirt, and walking shoes. My partner had to buy undergarments, toiletries, skincare, etc. I’ve been keeping all receipts in case we need them for a claim.

What’s worse is that all our plans for this trip have been impacted. We were supposed to go to Batu Caves, check out bars at night, and visit Petronas Towers dressed nicely. We even had a day trip planned to Genting Highlands. All of that’s basically on hold unless we go shopping here.

It rained on our first night, and I was only wearing my Adidas slides (only shoes I had in my carry-on). They had no grip and I nearly slipped a few times walking on the hotel pavement. I’ve got flat feet and my walking shoes were in my checked bag, so I was in pain every 10 minutes until I found new shoes to buy.

Day 2: Amex followed up with Qantas and Jetstar again. Qantas now says the bags arrived in Singapore, but no one seems to know what happens next or where they actually are. We’re still left waiting.

If anyone’s had something similar happen — especially with Qantas, Jetstar, or Amex Travel — would love to hear how you got it sorted. Also wondering what my chances are for getting compensated for all this mess.

Thanks in advance.

I have booked the layover hotel that China Southern offers for free but I wanted to know if I’m able to take my checked luggage out of the airport and bring it back and check it in the next day? I’m hoping to do some shopping in China but also have access to all my toiletries in my checked bag.  I land at 4:50 pm on Sunday and my flight going to Japan is at 4:20 pm on Monday.
