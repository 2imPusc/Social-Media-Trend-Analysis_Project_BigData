gaming,1jufto1,mm20dec,"I think my biggest concern is the US still doesn't really think internet is a right, it's more of a privilege-- the Affordable Connectivity Program ended some time ago and I've gotten an offer for free internet through my provider, but it was the lowest speed they could offer me. I guess free internet is better than nothing if I couldn't afford it, but I know internet companies like to hike your prices up whenever they get a good reason (or lack thereof) to do so...  
  
I'm guessing the Game Key Cards are made because some games won't fit on the cartridge (I would not be shocked if FF7 Remake Intergrade is on a Key Card if it gets a physical release, for example)... but it's still going to be a bad system if Nintendo completely resorts to this system down the line like Sony is with not offering a disc drive with the console itself.

gaming,1jufto1,mm7xirk,"That's a fair observation and part of why I'm not totally melting down over it, but they do still have the power to do what Disney did with their older animated films before streaming became common. For those that don't know there was something called the ""Disney Vault"" that the company put old masterpieces in which just meant they removed them from physical circulation until they ""opened the vault"" again to rerelease. Biggest example i can give is during the 90s when I was a kid. Many of the films from the 1930s thru 1970s were coming out of the vault for rereleases. It was a huge marketing ploy and very dumb when I think back to it.

And you may say it's different because that's physical media and people could keep them. But the thing is these days a company can do something similar and pull their product from the internet completely and if they want there's still the possibility yo completely remove the ability for people to stream the content online in the same way these platforms do when the rights to content transfer to another company. Now you can't watch it because you don't have that service. It's all about the possibility that Nintendo very well could pull a ""Disney Vault"" situation at a much larger scale.

But that's all just a possibility. Honestly after the Mulan situation where they made people pay for early access to watch it despite already being subscribed should've taught them a lesson. And hopefully Nintendo isn't stupid enough to think people will support them if they remove our access to digital/physical licenses to their titles.",3,2025-04-09 14:46:50,mhireina

So come fathers day during the first year of COVID I said fuggit and bought him a copy via Steam cause he knew his way around the program from playing Team Fortress (Yes TF1). He was only acclimated with holding down the RMB to MOVE and LMB to shoot. WASD was a foreign concept to him. He was never a big big gamer at all so it was no surprise that he was a little frustrated trying to learn this and was going to basically give up.


So instead I gave him one of my old controllers and just kinda coached him through it. It took some time but he got it down. Now he spends more hours in that game then I ever have and I couldn't be happier to show him the same lesson. ",10,2025-04-09 21:51:07,beaudafool

gaming,1jpc49g,mkynvy5,"I’m recovering from a stroke in late 2022.  No cognitive impairment but lost a lot of function on my left side.  I was heavily into gaming before the stroke.  Through lots and lots of rehab which is still ongoing, I’ve gotten most of my function back and honestly, gaming helped a lot with that.  I mostly play PS5 games like Horizon, God of War, Ghost of Tsushima, etc.

When I first even tried picking up the controller about 6 months after the stroke, I could barely move the left analog stick with my thumb and I couldn’t independently move the rest of my hand well enough to hold the controller and use the left trigger buttons.  I played some casual games like those mosaic ones where you have to deduce which squares are filled and which are empty.  I don’t particularly enjoy those games, but it was good hand therapy, there was no timing or coordination component (like aiming and firing a bow at an active enemy) and it was a nice diversion to just sitting there watching TV and feeling sorry for myself.  It really helped getting use of my left hand back!

I’m still not back to my pre-stroke ability but I’m most of the way there.  I just finished yet another replay of both Horizon games, and I am starting on another run through of Ghost of Tsushima in anticipation of the sequel.   Then maybe Subnautica again, it’s been at least a year since I last played that.   Gone are the days of CoD, Fortnite, and other PvP games.  I was not a real big fan of those before anyway, and I just don’t have the fast twitch reflexes anymore to compete.  I’m at a point in my life where I don’t need some 13 year old wiping the floor with me and then calling me things they shouldn’t even know about at that age lol.

Disabilities come in many flavors.  As much as it sucked having a stroke, I’m grateful it wasn’t much worse.  And I should be able to mostly overcome it with time.  Others with more permanent disabilities, or cognitive issues, will have a different experience.

The game wants me to use L1 to block, but like Elden Ring, I just got used to using O to dodge so blocking isn't necessary.

gaming,1jqgf7e,ml6zk9z,"Are you sure about record profits though? Not only have a ton of dev companies gone bankrupt or are in a rough spot, the cost of development also went up not only by normal inflation means of everything getting more expensive but also by the sheer number of devs that is necessary nowadays to make a AAA title. There was a video the other day about the credits of some CoD or whatever game being over 2h long. 

I'm too lazy to look it up, but my feeling is that non-mobile gamers are pretty whiney when it comes to retail prices but are totally fine to spend $10-$20 on MTX and DLCs later on because that's small installments instead of one big sum. And the mobile market is every companies wet dream, predatory marketing schemes making people pay hundreds of dollars over the course of years while development is probably done by AIs at this point with how low-effort nearly all mobile games are. 

This is not in defence of publishers but rather the irrational mentality of buyers that likely leads to a lot of publishers including a store into every single game including SP titles. 

And at some point, I guess the cost of a successful game will still make a publisher rich, but the cost of 2-3 failed releases might also just ruin them.

gaming,1jqgf7e,ml6ssci,"Im writing this paragraph AFTER the second one. You ever start writing something, google for some numbers and accidentally prove yourself wrong? Oops. The gap between Gran Turismo on the PS1 and GTA 5 actually does indicate that prices should have risen at some point.

The top selling PS1 game, Gran Turismo, sold about 10 million copies, and cost $5mil to make. GTA V has sold 210 million copies, and cost $265mil. The rise in sales has almost matched the rise in development cost, but not quite. In this case, the games probably should have gone up in price if the ""cost per copy sold"" was supposed to stay the same. GTA 5 made less profit per game sold, but sold way more of them to make up for that.

The question is, should cost per copy actually matter? GTA 5 made billions and GT1 didnt. The reason computers today dont cost $55000 is that theyre easier to make and more people want to buy them. As a result, theres also billions in profit in that industry. When the first computer cost 55k, it didnt make anywhere near that much money.",14,2025-04-03 12:21:03,RedditButAnonymous

gaming,1jqcbmu,ml5ykba,"It helps beat scalpers, but punishes casual gamers or people that play their switch sparingly.

It’s a step in the right direction though I guess.

I tend to buy every console when it comes out, and this generation most of my play time has probably been on PS5.. I’m also full time working and a dad so gaming time is somewhat limited regardless, therefore my switch time is likely to be low outside of completing both Zelda games.

I guess other suppliers will still be doing preorders so I’ll try my luck there.

AoE2 holds up because multiple remasters have kept it up to date without changing the core of what makes it good.

gaming,1jr7it0,mlfw7ix,"I will be honest. It's kind of a disappointment, so far. I know it's still in development, but I don't think it will change *that much* in the future, honestly. 

Zois are incredibly stupid. 
They can't wait for other people to vacate a position before doing their actions and will just cancel it instead. 

There is no item-zoi passive interaction, meaning that a zoi sitting on the couch can't watch the TV if it was turned on by another one and zois in general are completely deaf to music turned on by someone else. They don't react to other zois actions, unless they're specifically targeted. They act like lifeless robots even compared to early Sims games. 

If a zoi makes food, they won't eat unless you tell them to and if they're hungry they will ""eat soup"" from the fridge instead of whatever the fuck they just cooked. If a family member makes a family sized portion, nobody will touch it if not to throw it in the dishwasher.

If a zoi is using the restroom, other zois will act shocked even when there's a wall between them. They can also see eachother and greet from other rooms. It seems like they only react based on distance and not sight, which seems like a quick and easy (and cheap) way to make it work.",14,2025-04-04 21:13:12,I_think_Im_hollow

The delivery is not great either. It also really doesn't let you think about what you see or draw any conclusions for yourself without literally spelling it all out for you.

Frankly if we could just see the footage and judge for ourselves it would be better viewing experience, the narration actively detracts from it.

A few years back, Paradox, makers of great strategy games with nearly zero voice work, got the Star Trek license.

Instead of making a new game, they outsourced it and slapped a Star Trek logo on a years old version of their space game Stellaris, with one major change.

Unlike in Stellaris, all the factions in Star Trek Infinite had voiced lines when you contacted them.

Poorly written, badly recorded, horribly acted, voiced lines.

""Knives talk, money howls."" Says the Klingon, like that means anything, in the monotone of an accountant, or more likely, a programmer they pulled into the booth at the last second.

The worst part, is there were better voices avaliable... in the paid DLC.

Yep, they released a shit game, with shit voice acting, just so they could sell DLC to replace the shit voice acting.

Anyway, I was too young and sucked hard at the game. It was hard as hell and I never managed to pass the third level. Then one day my parents were away I invited a friend and asked him to play co-op with me. We played and I realized that in co-op when one of you dies, they respawn as long as the other player is still alive. I barely played an hour or so with my friend. 

But then I proceeded to finish the game in co-op mode, except I played alone. I would go forward with player one, make sure everything was safe and cleaned up, and move player 2 forward after that.

I play a lot of games.  I identify it as gaming.  Recently played titles over the past couple of years, in no particular order - Skyrim, Stellaris, Doom 2016, Titanfall 2, Mass Effect Legendary Edition, Everspace 2, Red Dead Redemption 2, City of Heroes (MMO).  Replayed some old classics - Original Half-Life/Opposing Force/Blue Shift, and Half Life 2+Episodes 1 and 2.

Tried but bounced off of Dragon Age: Origins, Kingdom Come: Deliverance, Starfield, Outer Wilds.  Will probably come back to those when I have the time.

Kinda busy with work and RL stuff so I don't have time or energy to try to learn a lot of new game systems, which may be why I tend to replay older classics that I am familiar with.  I have a lot of unplayed games in my backlog - maybe one of these days.

Working sucks, but being poor sucks worse, so I'm gonna try to slog it out a couple more years until I hit 70, then I can work on that backlog if I can still see the screen by then. :)",205,2025-04-11 23:48:39,_Rusty_Axe
gaming,1jx3tc4,mmo2p7m,"My mother is in her mid-70's and I bought her a Nintendo Switch a year and a half ago. 

She has bad hands due to age and arthritis. But I got her a small PowerA Nano Wired Controller - Zelda themed because she loves watching me play BoTW and ToTK on my Switch. She loves the compact controller because it doesn't hurt her hands so much.


She played some Mario Kart 8 Deluxe for a while, but it was too intense for her lol so I had her try Animal Crossing New Horizons on my Switch. 

She still plays it to this day, every single day - she loves it so much. She was even brought to tears when she thought we had lost her save when I migrated her island from my Switch to hers.

But every morning she watches The Price Is Right or reads... then fires up her Switch, chooses her little outfit, gathers all the crops, gives everyone an Apple or Orange, and catches the same couple of types of fish - because she always plays at the same time of day (I wish they would tweak that a bit)... she also enjoys clapping her hands while getting a boat ride to another island and the yoga activity. OH AND SHE LOVED THE NEW YEARS EVE STUFF!!

Then she sells all her stuff to get her ""points"" and takes her outfit off, and tucks her character into bed.

Then she plays Mahjong.

And it makes me happy she enjoys it. I think it has even improved her mind and overall happiness. I try to get her to consider other games.

But she loves ACNH and her Mahjong.

Sometimes I want to write the devs of ACNH and thank them. And to tell them to hurry up and make a new one because my mom would love to see what they do next before she moves on to wherever we go after this life.

And to maybe add a little more variety. I feel bad she does a lot of the same same. Would be nice to have more games and activities.",77,2025-04-12 02:06:55,theCBCAM

A few Xbox/Game Pass games come to mind that might be a good fit:

* **Stardew Valley** – Super relaxing, no fast reflexes needed, and kind of like Animal Crossing but with more to do. You farm, fish, talk to townsfolk, and just do your own thing. Really peaceful and rewarding.
* **PowerWash Simulator** – I know it sounds dumb, but it’s honestly so satisfying. Just blasting dirt off stuff with a power washer. No stress, just good vibes.
* **Forza Horizon 5** – Even if he’s not into racing, this is just a beautiful open world where you can cruise around, do little events, or just explore. Very beginner-friendly and chill.
* **Unpacking** – A quiet, cozy puzzle game where you unpack someone’s stuff and place it in a new home. No timers, no pressure, just kind of meditative.
* **Solitaire Collection** – Classic, easy to get into, and probably familiar. Not flashy, but good brain food.

If he ever does want some light online interaction, maybe Minecraft on peaceful mode could work. You could even join him once in a while and just build random stuff together.

Also, setting up bigger text and maybe turning on accessibility settings (like reduced difficulty or aim assist) could make things easier to jump into.

It is not the players job to balance the game and make it fun to play. It is the game designers job.

I’m finding it very weird to see this kind of “feature” implemented in Doom TDA, as I remember Hugo Martin talking a lot of times of the importance of having the player stay on the “fun zone” of the game, and how in Doom Eternal the gameplay heavily enforced the player to keep moving, being agressive and keep shooting. So having the player to try to balance it out the game doesn’t make much sense as the player wouldn’t know what is the supposed fun zone that they are supposed to be.

And the fact that I can change the parry window… having an option to change it completely removes the fun of being good at parrying and expressing this skill, as everbody can be just as good as you by just puting the parry Window at minimum.",-7,2025-04-01 13:29:57,DisasterNarrow4949

gaming,1jlugs6,mk6s8vv,"I haven't played ACS yet, but I do have a thought that might apply to OP's issue. In a lot of (modern) open world games, the player is so free and so powerful to travel wherever they want, that getting to a location is not special, but it's trivial. 

I'm currently playing Far Cry 6 and if I wanted to, I think I could swim, fly, drive or boat my way to almost any place on the entire map, as soon as the basic tutorial is done. No place is special, no place is hard to get to, no place gets built up as if it were a character in the game. It's just *there*, waiting for me to walk in, do my little quest, and leave it again. 

One of my favorite ancient games is Outcast. It's an open world action/adventure. In theory, you can get almost everywhere from the start. But its palaces, temples and military complexes are absolutely lethal if you don't know what you're doing, and almost all of them play crucial roles in the game's storyline. So they're places that are mentioned before the player gets to them, are built up as dangerous places, are shown to the player (and these places bite back if the player walks in too early in the game!), are set pieces in the storyline, and are quite literally conquered. 

TLDR: Places in games that are easy to get to, won't feel as special as places that were a challenge. Ubisoft games allow a lot of freedom and don't lock the player out of places, when sometimes that could help to make the world feel a bit more special.",159,2025-03-28 14:18:47,twonha

gaming,1jlugs6,mk6ieex,"I have trouble understanding these statements sometimes. 

What exactly is missing? Do you want to be able to have dinner inside strangers’ homes? Have full conversations with random guards? 

These games are made to be Combat-oriented, the world is meant to serve the gameplay and put the game inside a world, but it’s not a “living simulation” and it could never be that.

I agree there are things they could refine in the open world, but most of what this game does is very similar to how most open world games work.

gaming,1jlugs6,mk6k6tn,"That's just Open World games in general. All of them have large stretches of basically nothing to just pass through on your way to the next objective similar to real life. The ones that do try and fill the void usually have random encounters which can be neat but they can only make so many unique ones so you end up with repetitive things like fighting random bandits or helping the same character models do the same thing. I haven't played Shadows but I never would have suspected anything different from what you described going into it as it's just the nature of open world games in general. 

I'm also not sure what you were hoping for? If every NPC was unique then you end up with Elder Scrolls where the ""cities"" are a couple dozen people because it takes a lot of time and resources to craft a unique NPC. If cities were realistic then a huge amount of resources would go to things the majority of gamers (and even you probably) would never see such as NPC's closing up shops, visiting each other's houses, etc. 

In the end you effectively have the Elder Scrolls method where the unimportant citizens/buildings that must be there just aren't shown to the player or you get the usual method where the unimportant people/places are shown to the player but don't do anything.",42,2025-03-28 13:35:35,Pallysilverstar

# Other stuff

https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-offers-new-details-on-switch-2-hardware-software/

> Third-party publishers announced a number of ports for the Switch 2, including Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition, Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, Hades II, Street Fighter VI, Split Fiction, EA Sports FC, Madden NFL, Hogwarts Legacy (with new Mouse Controls), Yakuza 0 Director's Cut, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4, and Hitman: World of Assassination.

> FromSoftware also offered an extended preview of a new vampire-themed, Bloodborne-inspired action RPG game called The Duskbloods. The Switch 2 exclusive, planned for 2026, showed off a wide range of metaphyiscal imagery and both melee and gun-based combat, including a character that flies around in a metal suit with a jetpack.

> The Switch 2 will include 256 GB of internal storage. Players can add additional storage only through MicroSD Express cards, which will ""make high-speed data transfers possible."" Regular MicroSD cards that work on Switch will not be compatible with the new console. Game Cards for the Switch 2 resemble the shape of those for the original Switch, but will be in red and feature ""much faster data reading speeds,"" Nintendo announced.

> Nintendo Switch Online memberships will carry over to Switch 2. And Switch 2 owners who subscribe to the Expansion Pack will get access to a library of Nintendo Gamecube games including The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, Soulcalibur II, F-Zero GX at launch, with more to be added in the future. These games will feature ""sharper graphics and higher resolution"" than the original releases, Nintendo said. A replica wireless GameCube controller will also be available for purchase by Nintendo Switch Online members.

> Nintendo also showed a small preview of a new, open-world Kirby Air Riders game. The follow up to GameCube's Kirby's Air Ride showed the pink puffball grabbing a jetpack-propelled star across verdant, grassy fields.

> The presentation concluded with a new 3D Donkey Kong game, named Donkey Kong Bonanza, planned for July 17. The trailer showing a redesigned, cuter version of the big ape climbing cliffs, digging through highly destructible ground, and bashing enemies into one another with massive punches, alongside classic 2D and mine cart sections.

> Nintendo will send out invitations for ""priority"" purchasing of the Switch 2, direct from the company, starting May 8. Those who have purchased a Switch Online membership as of April 2, have had it for a minimum of 12 months, have opted to share gameplay data, and have logged at least 50 hours get priority. There will be a 72-hour window in which to use priority purchasing invitations.",1,2025-04-02 13:42:52,printial

I think especially as From gets more and more successful it's going to be more and more difficult for them to experiment with new gameplay styles and mechanics. Nightreign and Duskbloods feel like them experimenting and trying new things. Maybe they succeed, maybe not. The big take away though is that as a company From will learn lessons from these games that they might have never before that will influence future titles.

gaming,1jyc4u4,mmx7wp0,"That PvP specific gamers have become somewhat sociopathic and anti-social in a digital space. Because it's the one place in their lives, they feel that they have control and power over someone else. Since our quality of life has degraded IRL and everyone feels squeezed and depressed constantly.

Edit: 
I realize that my original take is too short hand to capture the gravity of the claim This edit is to address this. It isn't everyone who plays PVP games. I myself play PvP games. 3k hours in PvP Tarkov before they added PvE got Kappa the second wipe it was available, 5-6 star player in Hunt Showdown with 1.6k hours in have played every event since I started playing including the one going right now.

The issue isn't all PvP players. Its that PvP communities breed toxic, cruel, angry, and simultaniously false supiriority behaviours that have only gotten worse as time has gone on. My crew is small and close knit because we all are chill. We all take the losses and the wins and keep it fun. We are as kind as one can be in a digital competiton space. And we occasionally look for new folks to join the crew. It was much easier to find people in the games we play who don't show toxic behaviours before now. 

As time has gone on its become increasingly harder to find people who will play a competitive game for fun rather than to win. Stay calm in our losses and be kind and humble in our victories. Its not a single game issue. Its a wider issue in gaming as a whole. Which leads to issues that have gotten worse IRL for people and nod to a much larger issue. 

As a whole people are more stressed out every day IRL. Due to political, social, and economical pressures that everyone cant help but feel at this point. Some people aren't able to separate the parts of their lives from one another and the anger, rage, strain, and stress comes out in outlets they feel safe in. 

Behind the screen, you are safe, You can vent your frustrations and angers of the day. Some don't have the grace to hold themselves accountable or to an acceptable social standard and they don't have to. No one is going to hold them to that but themselves. And why should they when the pressure of their day IRL bleeds away any contentment and peace they may be able to have otherwise. Besides, who cares what an internet stranger thinks...

It circles back into gaming through voip, text chat, gestures, and emotes. One toxic player is toxic to another toxic player who is then toxic to non-toxic players and it goes on. It becomes more normalized and the social standards in the digital space decline. 

The winning and being the best or better is validating. Makes the time, energy, and care put into skill at a game worth it. When so much of our lives is wasted on unfulfilling mindless tasks. Where our skill is a punishment instead of a reward.

For me personally, I don't really blame the individuals for acting toxically. It is a choice they are making. But the failures of our society are showing through in every aspect of life. The facade is crumbling. All lies are truth and any truth that isn't profitable is a lie.

Life sucks. Some people have to share that with others more directly.",277,2025-04-13 16:59:12,gears19925

gaming,1jo93iv,mkq4jgk,"You should play Noita. That game is filled to the brim with unknown interactions. Alchemy, liquid interactions, fires and explosions, unknown enemies, magical liquids, quests, puzzles, secrets. A huge chunk of the game exists outside the normal path, and you need to know how to get there and what lives there in order to survive. But once you do, you can extract some of the most powerful spells and items that the game can offer you.

Usually people spend dozens of hours trying to beat the game (on the normal path) once, but with a little knowledge (and perhaps a dose of luck) you can become a nearly unkillable god that bends reality to their will.

And because it's a roguelike, you'll find different spells each time you run through. Knowing how these spells work together, you can make some extremely powerful wands much earlier than normal. There are a few tricks that are well known, and some that are lesser known, but knowledge is *always* power.

You start out thinking the game is all in a single cave. Then you find that there are other areas of the world. And then you find that there are entire other areas *above and below* the world. And then you *find out that there are entirely other worlds*.

The game teaches you none of this directly. Exploration might hint at certain interactions, but experimentation and exploration are required. Part of me wishes I could unlearn how to play, so that I could experience it anew again.

You now know that these platforms fall, so if you play the game correctly, you can beat the level first try.

gaming,1jphpku,mkzq6g9,"10 hours in, haven't gotten any endings yet because I am taking my time to explore, and unfortunately I do agree with your points.

Playing on intense difficulty, so I don't know if easier difficulties will have a significant difference in experience.

Having no fast travel is fine, since this game takes place in several medium-sized regions instead of one massive map. But because your only mode of transportation is just sprinting, it can get tedious.

Stealth is completely worthless as least on intense difficulty.

* Enemies can spot you instantly from a mile away
* They frequently move and turn around a lot
* Your character moves too slowly
* Stealth takedowns causes a lot of noise

Every time when I just running from region to region and not actually fighting anyone, I always hear outlaws in the background going ""alright back up, you don't want any trouble"", when I am nowhere near them or even in their territory.

I guess taking stealth perks could rectify all of that, but skill points ain't easy to come by unless you are really exploring every nook and cranny. Honestly it's a lot easier to just run in every fight, take cover and gun them down one by one.

Melee combat is also really bad. **There's no actual dodge or block in this game**. You have a light melee attack, a heavy melee attack, and a kick. Your only way of stopping enemy melee attacks is by hitting them with melee and hoping it staggers them, or by simply kicking them. So every melee encounter boils down to kick and attack, kick and attack, rinse and repeat.

At least gun combat is a lot more tolerable. Even on intense difficulty, you do find enough ammo for every encounter as long as you are properly exploring and not spending like 10 shots killing one dude. In fact even with the Deep Pockets perk, I'm always full on certain ammo types so I have to go out of my way to shoot some poor dude.

Oh and the AI in this game is hilariously bad. Spoilers ahead for one of my encounters:

>!I met this woman named Joyce in the Interchange, and you get a quest from her while she just hangs around the room. I managed to lure a feral to her room and she has no reaction whatsoever while I am running around with the feral in her room because she is fiddling with computers and her back is turned towards us. She finally turns around and reacts, but the feral just smack her and she dies.!<",44,2025-04-02 08:11:25,SubjectClass321
gaming,1jphpku,mkzfohn," I was really digging the story, but man is it a chore to explore the world they built. I agree on all your points, especially stealth. In my last play session, I was sneaking up on someone, was behind them, and they turned around to fuck up my takedown. Turned into an all out fight and I died. So next time around, I wait to see if he’s on a timer, turning every so often. Nope. No timer. I stealth up again, completely out of sight. Once again, at the last second he turns and sees me. For a game with emphasis on using stealth to avoid open combat, it sure hates when you use stealth at all.",367,2025-04-02 06:15:39,BatemanHarrison

gaming,1jphpku,ml01012,"Normally I enjoy Rebellion games, but this one feels like a chore to play. Combat is awkward and unrewarding, plus it’s forced on you by certain paths if you want to get to a specific area. The NPCs are unlikable. Even the skills system is awkward. 

I was really excited about this game until I played it.",22,2025-04-02 10:14:45,Diela1968
gaming,1jphpku,mkzz23n,"Yup, 100% agree. I spent 2 hours in it and was just incredibly frustrated the whole time. For a game that is so stingy on ammo, it doesnt offer you any real good alternatives to dealing with situations. Stealth sucks as you said, enemies spot you from a mile away and takedowns cause so much noise everyone immediately jumps on you. Melee sucks as you cant block/dodge so you every fight is a battle of attrition as some of the melee enemy attacks are unavaoidable. Couple that with the fact most fights are you vs \~5 enemies its usually easier to just try to avoid combat entirely which isnt ""fun"". Also it should be a cardinal sin to respawn enemies in a game with heavy ammo restrictions.

Luckily the AI is terrible and they just stand out in the open while they reload, so you just have to duck behind something when they are about to fire, and then pop up and headshot them. Youre also pretty tanky all things considered.

I found combat only began to get at least a little enjoyable when I threw caution into the wind and started to just use my guns more, hoping that Id get enough ammo off of the people I killed to keep me in a net positive.

Its a shame, as I loved the setting, the world is really pretty and the quirky little ""British'isms"" of it are super charming. I dont think I'll end up going back.",18,2025-04-02 09:54:08,nailbunny2000
gaming,1jphpku,mkzjgis,">but it never pulled me in like say, Fallout does   
Heck, compare it to Fallout 3 even.

I think your complaints are valid, but you should not be comparing this game to Fallout at all because it is not an RPG. The only thing it really shares with fallout is being a sort of post-nuclear setting with a 1950s science vibe. 

The actual game itself is much closer to a immersive sim like dishonored and prey, even though its not exactly like those games either.",73,2025-04-02 06:55:23,xanas263
