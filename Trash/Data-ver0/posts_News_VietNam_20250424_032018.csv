VietNam,1jyd4rd,"Obsessed Fan Grabs Head, Scratches Sơn Tùng M-TP's Arm; Security Team Criticised","Sơn Tùng M-TP experienced an incident with an overzealous fan during the *Sky Wave* concert, held on the night of April 12 in Hạ Long (Quảng Ninh Province, Vietnam). The incident has sparked outrage among netizens and fans alike.

# Obsessed Fan Jumps on Sơn Tùng M-TP

According to the circulating video, a male audience member unexpectedly breached security, ran onto the stage, and forcefully hugged and then jumped on Sơn Tùng M-TP.

Though surprised by the aggressive behaviour, the artist quickly regained his composure and politely said: ""Calm down, thank you so much everyone.""

Despite being pushed away by Sơn Tùng M-TP, the obsessed fan continued circling back and tried to pull the artist close again.

Only after security appeared did the fan return to the audience area. Concerned for the fan's safety, Sơn Tùng M-TP was heard saying ""careful, careful"", and kept repeating ""it's okay, thank you very much"".

Based on photos and videos, Sơn Tùng M-TP sustained a light scratch on his arm, with visible abrasions and bleeding following the incident.

Online, many have expressed concerns about the professionalism of the organisers for allowing such a dangerous situation to happen.

Comments from viewers include: ""Where were the security guards? It took them 2-3 minutes to get up there,"" ""So frustrating to watch,"" and ""What kind of show is this? So poorly managed.""

Some also pointed out that ""whether you're a fan or not, you can't behave in a way that endangers the artist and disrupts the entire programme"".

In addition to criticism of the organisers, many viewers praised Sơn Tùng M-TP's ability to handle the situation. Despite the chaos, the artist remained calm and continued interacting warmly with fans.

So far, neither the male singer nor the event organisers have commented on the fan's aggressive behaviour.

# Controversial Concert?

Previously, this concert had already sparked frustration due to ticket price fluctuations.

Tickets went on sale on March 16 and sold out all 10,000 within a day. However, many people were unable to buy tickets, while on the black market, tickets were still being sold in large quantities.

This was believed to be caused by ticket scalpers hoarding large amounts of tickets, then rushing to undercut official prices.

Resale prices fluctuated by the minute, with some tickets selling for 20–50% less than the original price, or even as buy-one-get-one-free deals.

This led to malicious rumours on social media, especially when some seats appeared empty, with people speculating that Sơn Tùng M-TP's popularity might be ""cooling off"".",64,0.85,19,2025-04-13 17:34:00,https://v.redd.it/31sseuh61nue1,notAssmin

VietNam,1jtojdq,What’s with the anti Viet Kieu with northern VNmese?,"TLDR; running into a lot of “how can you be Viet if…” comments from seemingly northerners.

Some background: I was born in HCM, lived a bit in Cambodia, and then moved to the UK when I was eight. So my Vietnamese is at the level of an eight year old (speaking, reading, and writing). 

I’ve now had multiple instances where (seemingly northerners) have made rude comments towards me. 

2016 - First time was at Tan Son Nhat, I asked for help with a form and was told ”người Việt mà không biết tiếng Việt”. Basically how am I Vietnamese without knowing Vietnamese. 

2023 - Second time was in the Vietnamese embassy in London where they had no English forms and I asked for one and was sighed at and also berated for not knowing Vietnamese. Ended up following along with Google translate.

2025 - Third time, also Tan Son Nhat. Tried to set up for the autogate and the guy behind the counter spoke very fast with a strong northern accent (not something I’m exposed to much). Then when I told him I didn’t understand much he asked me how I could have a Vietnamese passport if I didn’t understand. To which I responded that I was born here and left when I was young. He of course responded saying I shouldn’t have one if I don’t understand… 

Each incident seems to have common themes. My inability to understand high level language, and their northern accents. 

Anyone else experienced something similar?

Edit:
Just want to make sure people are not getting the wrong end of the stick. Perhaps my choice of wording isn’t right. I’m just trying to understand if there is context I am missing for these encounters - which some of you have informed me about the sentiments from Northerns to Viet Kieus from the war (and I appreciate that) it adds context. 

I’m not trying to say all Northerners hate Viet Kieus, in my experience it just seems to happen when official documents/processes and a northern dialect is involved. I’ve had very loving and kind interactions with people from all over Viet Nam, including the north.

VietNam,1jycoam,Moving to Vietnam,"Hi, I’m from the U.S. and got married to a Vietnamese woman in Vietnam two years ago. I knew her the previous 5 years on Facebook. I lived in Seattle, and made several Vietnamese friends there that introduced us. 

I always wanted to visit her, she made me wait 5 years, lol. Fell in love before we ever met. 

We were originally going to try and get her immigration here. The last two times I was in Vietnam, I fell in love with the country and the people. Her family loves me, and don’t expect anything from me than to be happy. 

I like the U.S., but live Vietnam. I have no real family here…and have hers there. I told her I’d like to move to VN, and the entire family was happy. 

They are not rich, not poor, own businesses and live comfortable lives. I’m not rich either. Everyone I met there was very kind to me. 

I plan on coming in about a month. With all this Trump news going on, I hope people are still kind to Americans that love Vietnam. Thought I’d come on here and see how people felt about people like me. I don’t care much for politics, I love my wife and Vietnamese family…and am coming regardless…asking if you think Americans will be treated differently because of what Trump does or doesn’t do?

I looked into other reddit pages in european countries, for example in Germany they do have the right to kick children out at 18, yet their law says parents must pay for children until they finished education that enables them to go and work (maximum 25). They also say kicking out isn't a culture there. So if it is not culture there, why do they keep telling such stories of parents kicking out at 18 as if it is their culture ?

VietNam,1jn3fzc,Hoi An tailors may be marking up hundreds of percents - my experience,"Hey everyone, just want to share my experience with tailors in Hoi An.

I thought it was kinda expensive but then i was like yea pure silk, handmade, guess it is worth this much.

Then we went to Hue, and to Da Nang. Went to the most popular tailors there, and the pricetags for identical models from also 100% silk, of the same fabric texture and feel, cost 35-50$. With a way bigger selection of silk even.

So this post is not to defame any tailor in hoian or to convince people to get their clothes tailored elsewhere, this is just my experience. The price me and my wife paid for a kimono and a dress was enough to buy about 5 custom made silk kimonos for my entire family + lots of silk for my mum.

They respond: no, no, it’s fine, just continue. 

And the trainer must know better, right? Wrong. After the lesson after the person got off the horse was foaming at the mouth and had eye wrinkles. That is wrong. I am not going back.

And why i couldn’t do anything? I am a kid. No one will listen to a teen. The adults know better right?

VietNam,1jug4ej,Go watch Tunnel/ Địa Đạo. Highly recommend!,"I know it kind of sudden, but HOLY SHIT! The movie is good. 

I came in, expecting something like: ""Captialism U.S.A bad!!!! Communism good, it is freedom, it is what we fought for!"" And hell, I set the bar so LOW! I even brought my sketch note and a pen with me write down the bad parts of the movie but it never leave my pocket until the credit roll. 

But no! It was Good, really good, to the point that I ponder whether or not it was made by A24. The story, the pacing, the message, the combat, the sound even, it was SO GOOD! Maybe the only downside I can mentioned of the fighter plane and that just it, it show once during the bombing, and all, 10 seconds in an 2 hour film. It leave time for moment to linger and rememberable. Especially some of the death brutal and raw but not to the point it completely romantize them. 

Maybe the character is a bit cliché and I do agree that some romantic part of the story is one of the weak point but it so small and was in the first stage movie that it kind of was wash over me. 

On top of that...FINALLY! NO ""HÀI NHẢM"" and that is such a fresh air. The humor is on point and fit with the moment and you could felt like it could be something they said in that moment.

Lastly, the message, it is pro-communism? Actually and unexpect-ly no. Maybe there is but it was so suttle and would wash over those who aren't native and trying dig too too deep into politic. And it is another great point of the movie because it felt relatable to my own belief of the core reason we fight was just for freedom, that it is. There are no politic, no communism ideal shove down my throat, it is just about 'Why we fight?' . Just that and it give me that patriotic feeling. 

I am not saying this because I am patrioic or communist ethutiastic or want to ""support Vietnamese movie industry"" kind of guy. I have seen bad Vietnamese movie, really bad one that have oversexulizing or just cringy, trying to copy major action movie (858 or something, really terrible). 

In conclusion: It is peak Vietnam Cinema for me, and if anything, it be like the Battlefield 1 of Battlefield franchise- a well-respected and well made historical media. Hope this is what they will put in Cu Chi Tunnel cinema, because it really fit compare to what they had now.

So yeah! If you had some time, go watch it. ",47,0.79,33,2025-04-08 15:19:00,https://i.redd.it/3v8cduqoomte1.jpeg,binhan123ad
VietNam,1jo5i2l,Vietnam's Ministry of Culture Directs Investigation into ViruSs Controversy on Social Media,"**The Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism is directing relevant authorities to investigate Vietnamese streamer and musician ViruSs, who has been hosting livestream sessions to publicly discuss [his romantic relationships with multiple women](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Polyamory).**

Nguyễn Danh Hoàng Việt, Chief of Office and spokesperson for the ministry, stated that the ministry has instructed authorities to look into ViruSs and several TikTokers who have been livestreaming discussions about his relationship controversies, drawing millions of viewers.

""The Authority of Broadcasting, Television, and Electronic Information will investigate the matter and provide the latest updates to the press,"" Việt said.

Previously, ViruSs had hosted livestreams to confront and clarify his relationships with women such as Ngọc Kem and rapper Pháo (Nguyễn Diệu Huyền), stirring up social media.

These live broadcasts attracted millions of viewers. On the night of March 28 alone, one session had over 4 million viewers, with peak concurrent viewership exceeding 1.5 million.

Clips from these confrontational livestreams have been widely shared across social media platforms, also garnering millions of views and comments.

Cultural researcher Đoàn Xuân Hương commented that young people today are driven by herd mentality—flocking to and sharing whatever generates buzz.

""But they don't realise that such 'drama' is highly toxic for young audiences, as it consists only of emotional disputes and personal matters.

If in the past, people would say, 'Private matters should be discussed behind closed doors,' today's youth expose everything for public scrutiny. To me, these are ugly stories with no educational value,"" Hương expressed.

TV host Lê Anh also criticised the trend, stating that ViruSs' livestream conversations with his acquaintances are purely personal, lacking verification, academic value, educational merit, or meaningful direction.

According to Lê Anh, ViruSs' livestreams are not only inappropriate but may also violate Decree 147, recently issued by the government to regulate livestream activities and account verification.

Lê Anh further commented: ""No country can advance if its youth waste hours watching romantic drama instead of investing in education, creativity, and their future.

Vietnamese youth deserve greater aspirations—beyond just a 'like', a midnight laugh, or a meaningless argument.""

ViruSs, whose real name is Đặng Tiến Hoàng, was born in 1990 in Hanoi. Coming from a family with an artistic background, he spent much of his childhood studying music and was trained in piano at the Hanoi Conservatory of Music, now known as the Vietnam National Academy of Music.

Later, he became a professional gamer, serving as captain of Hanoi Dragons, a well-known domestic *League of Legends* team.

In 2014, ViruSs retired from competitive gaming and transitioned into streaming and e-sports commentary. He is recognised as one of Vietnam's ""[Four Streaming Kings](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteFour)"", alongside Độ Mixi, PewPew, and Xemesis.

Beyond streaming, ViruSs has been active in the entertainment industry, composing, performing, and producing numerous hit songs.",52,0.85,49,2025-03-31 15:11:24,https://i.redd.it/ki5g6p92j1se1.png,notAssmin
VietNam,1k52o37,Trip report - 18 days in Vietnam,"Since this sub was so helpful when I (solo 43F) planned my itinerary, I thought I’d give back to the community with a trip report - hopefully someone will find it useful! I like my itineraries fairly packed (which I think will be clear from the below), but I genuinely didn’t feel rushed at all during this trip - obviously everyone likes a different pace so YMMV.

TLDR: it was amazing. Go to Vietnam.

Wednesday 2 April - flew out of London (direct flight with Vietnam Airlines).

Thursday 3 April - landed in Ho Chi Minh City early afternoon. Took a taxi to the service apartment I had booked in Japan Town (INDO Serviced Apartment) and walked around the area. It’s definitely a red light district, which could put some people off, but it really was absolutely fine and I never felt unsafe. The apartment itself wasn’t amazing, it looked nothing like the pictures online, but it did what it needed to do, it was cheap and I only saw one live cockroach inside. Worked out in the gym attached to the apartment, went for a massage in the evening and discovered that supermarkets in that part of town sell melonpan, which made me very happy.

Friday 4 April - explored District 1. Worked out that the way to cross the street is “have faith”, strolled around Ben Thanh market, took a look at Notre Dame Basilica (from the outside because it was temporarily closed when I went), the Central Post Office, went to the War Remnants Museum (terrible pictures but I think important to see/not forget). Went to the zoo and wished I hadn’t. Went for a run on the treadmill (which I really dislike but running outdoors in Ho Chi Minh City didn’t seem as easy/straightforward as in other places). In the evening I had a food tour with XO Tours and it was absolutely fantastic - very strongly recommended (in particular as they take you outside of District 1) and I wish I’d booked their other tours too! 

Saturday 5 April - kept exploring Ho Chi Minh City. Went to the Jade Emperor Pagoda, Tan Dinh market and Phu Chau floating temple (the latter is a bit out of the way but easily reachable with a Grab bike and, I thought, worth visiting). In the evening I had a tasting menu at Anan Saigon - good but not mind-blowing, but the relaxed atmosphere and the chilled bartender made it worth it.

Sunday 6 April - took a day trip combining the Cu Chi tunnels and Mekong delta. Discovered coconut candy and my life changed.

Monday 7 April - flew to Da Nang then went straight to Hoi An. Had my first egg coffee and my life changed (and that’s even before I tried salted coffee, which ended up being my favourite). Stayed at Maison Hai Homestay and it was fantastic. Had a lovely evening food tour with a company called Hoi An Food Tour, ate lots of delicious food and played a hilarious game of traditional Vietnamese bingo. 

Tuesday 8 April - Had a great early morning run along the river (we’re talking 5 am. Any later is way too hot already) and took a day trip to the old imperial city in Hue. The tomb of the last king (which we visited in the afternoon) was my favourite spot.

Wednesday 9 April - took an early morning trip to My Son sanctuary and Marble mountain - the 5:30 am departure was worth it to beat the crowds and the heat. Really enjoyed the sanctuary, the ruins look stunning. Chilled in Hoi An in the afternoon and went to a local gym to work out (Superfit Hoi An Fitness and Yoga - easy to get a day pass, good equipment, lockers, sells water, small towel provided to wipe equipment down but not convinced by the showers so I showered back at my homestay). Bought an extra “Fjallraven” bag to store all the coconut candy I bought on the Mekong delta day trip. 

Thursday 10 April - flew from Da Nang to Ha Noi. Explored the Old Quarter. Had my first Bun Cha and my life changed. Stayed in the Silk Grand Premium Hotel and Spa - it was neither premium nor grand but it did the job. Had a great massage in the evening. 

Friday 11 April and Saturday 12 April - early morning run around Hoan Kiem lake. Left my luggage at the hotel in Ha Noi and took a 2D/1N trip to Ninh Binh. This was the highlight of my trip (so far! Little did I know that my mind would be irreversibly blown only a few days later). Went to the Mua caves (do not go into the Tiger Cave! It was just an ankle-deep pond inside and you can’t see a thing, so I ended up with wet socks and shoes), a stunning bird sanctuary at sunset, biked around Tam Coc and through rice paddies, visited a local market in the morning, did the Trang An boat trip and unexpectedly stayed overnight in a gorgeous resort which was way more luxurious than what I’m used to (Lalita resort). Got back to Ha Noi mid-afternoon on the second day.

Sunday 13 April - Spent morning and early afternoon in Ha Noi. Did a really interesting tour called “Stories from Vietnam war at not-to-go-alone areas”. Discovered avocado ice cream in a tall glass of avocado smoothie (at Cafe Kem Bo Xuka) and my life changed. Left my big luggage at what was going to be my next hotel in Ha Noi, packed a small bag and boarded a bus to Ha Giang at 4 pm. 

Monday 14 April to Thursday 17 April - premium 4D/3N Ha Giang loop with Road Kings and MY LIFE FUCKING CHANGED FOREVER. Nothing I have ever done comes close. Everything I did next was shit in comparison. I cried my heart out when it was over and, as I’m typing this on my flight back home, I’m seriously depressed. I was in a group of 9 and we bonded right away. The views were out of this world (the weather was absolutely perfect for the 4 days and visibility was excellent). The food was amazing. The camaraderie was incredible. I had an easy rider and he was the absolute best. I would go back to Vietnam in a heartbeat just to do the loop again and, if/when I do, it will 100% be with Road Kings again.

Friday 18 April - got back to Ha Noi around 2 am. The sleeper bus wasn’t as bad as I was led to believe (although it was certainly an experience) and we did have a rest stop (I’d heard horror stories of buses not stopping on the way. I’m glad mine did). Checked into the hotel where I had left my luggage (Golden Rooster - really nice, staff absolutely outstanding, would definitely return) and crashed for the night. Went to the Vietnamese Women’s Museum (really nice), the Temple of Literature and had a lunch tasting menu at Gia (not worth it. My life definitely did NOT change). Had a lovely evening run around Hoan Kiem lake.

Saturday 19 April and Sunday 20 April - went for an early morning run around the lake, then did a 2D/1N Lan Ha bay cruise. It wasn’t too busy although it was fairly overcast. Went with Venezia Cruise - by no means luxurious but the boat was fine, the bed was super comfortable and the views from the cabin obviously really cool. Food was a let down because it very clearly catered to westerners and therefore lacked flavour. Lan Ha bay was gorgeous but I personally preferred Ninh Binh. Back in Ha Noi mid-afternoon on the second day, wandered aimlessly to try and soak in everything I could and lamenting my impending departure.

Monday 21 April - flew home, utterly heartbroken. 

I didn’t expect it but I fell so hard in love (and not just with my easy rider). Normally at the end of a trip I feel ready to go home, but this time it feels like I am actually grieving and I am so, so sad to be returning to real life. Thank you so much, Vietnam, for changing my life in so many ways!

VietNam,1k3jm4y,Nguyen Van Nguyen: A Revolutionary Journalist of Southern Vietnam,"**Vietnamese Text on the Sign:**  
""Nguyễn Văn Nguyên (1910 - 1953) quê quán Châu Thành - Tiền Giang. Ông là một chiến sĩ cốt cán, nhà báo viết có tài, nhà văn nghệ nhân dân.""

**Direct English Translation:**  
""Nguyen Van Nguyen (1910 - 1953), from Chau Thanh district, Tien Giang province, was a key fighter, a talented journalist, and a writer of the people.""

Nguyen Van Nguyen (1910–1953) was a prominent journalist and revolutionary in Vietnam's history. Born on March 15, 1910, in Dieu Hoa village, My Tho province (now Ward 1, My Tho city, Tien Giang province), he left a lasting legacy through his leadership in journalism and his contributions to the revolutionary cause.

Nguyen Van Nguyen made significant contributions to the field of journalism, serving as Director of the Southern Information Department and editor-in-chief of newspapers such as Cuu Quoc Nam Bo. His sharp, impactful writing not only conveyed the revolutionary message but also inspired others to join the cause. Beyond his journalism, he actively participated in revolutionary activities, holding key roles in building the resistance movement in southern Vietnam.

His death in 1953 marked the loss of a pivotal figure in Vietnam’s cultural and revolutionary history. Posthumously honored by President Ho Chi Minh with the First Class Independence Medal, his name endures in schools, streets, and commemorations in provinces like Tien Giang and Ben Tre, underscoring his continued impact on Vietnam’s identity.

VietNam,1k2v3bz,Noi Bai airport- quick vent,"I had such a joke of an experience heading through immigration (departures end) in noi bai airport this morning. Context i had already been on a flight from Ho Chi Minh and was up since 3am this morning. Immigration guy barks at me that I’ve overstayed my visa by one day even though I have a multi entry 90 day visa which expires in May. So he was off by a month and it said it clear as day in my passport. I am very aware of my vulnerability in that situation as I’m a foreigner etc but I did speak up and say “it expires on the - of May” and then he says, might I add, with a grin, “no” then barks at me to walk past all the queues who are all watching at this point, tells me to sit in the corner like a naughty child. Eventually a second person checks it and says it’s fine but there was literally no acknowledgment of the mistake even though the whole thing was rather humiliating. I’m wondering was he hoping I’d pay a fee even though I was not in the wrong. 

Anywho my new approach in life when these things happen is to pay it forward and add good karma into the world. I also have to say it does not stain my overall impression of Vietnamese people at all, it does not take away from all the wonderful experiences I’ve had talking to locals there and I will definitely return one day, once I’ve recovered from the trauma ;)",48,0.91,38,2025-04-19 12:25:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1k2v3bz/noi_bai_airport_quick_vent/,Crafty_Country_3924

But even among the cities, I failed to notice any mosque or religious gatherings (not a Muslim, but mere observation).

Basically, I used to get my nails done a lot at this one salon, like every two weeks maybe, and me and my mom always got them done by the same guy because we always wanted extravagant stuff and he's the most versatile. He was always really nice, and I didn't think anything of it. I started coming in less and less because I started playing sports and I couldn't have long nails, soon I started coming in only for special occasions. He started asking questions about my life more frequently, and my age (I'm in highschool, but I am legally an adult now) repeatedly. I didn't think about it too hard because for awhile he was also asking why I didn't want long nails anymore, so I assumed he was just missing the money. But then he said something I didn't understand. Literally I couldn't understand what he said, it was in Vietnamese, but he told me it was a proverb and had something to do with beauty (I don't remember it that well, he was having trouble translating it). I didn't really know how to respond so I just kept saying thank you, it wasn't really an awkward moment though.

 That was awhile ago, and I don't think I'd been in much after that. But some time last week, one of the ladies from the shop came to my job (I work at a grocery store) and while we were talking she mentioned that this guy missed me. Missed me. He missed me and she knew about it, so he was talking about me. Anyway, I told her I was gonna come in next week (today as of when I'm writing this). So I come in today, expecting him to be there because my mom had called ahead, and he wasn't. I was disappointed ngl. But that didn't matter for long, because someone FaceTimed him while I was getting my nails done and handed me the phone?? And he apologized for not coming because he was sick, said he thought I was never coming back, etc. That's unorthodox right? For all your coworkers to know you want to see a specific customer so badly that they call you while that customer is there, so you can say speak to them?

VietNam,1jnvgvw,Marriage in Vietnam as a foreigner experience,"So I was preparing to get married in Vietnam and was trying to get the paperwork ready in the US. I made a huge mistake and wasted a lot of time and money, so don't make the same mistake as me. I was initially following this [list of requirements](https://vn.usembassy.gov/marriage/). I thought I could get each of those requirements like Affidavit of Single Status, Record of no marriage myself in the US first. I made the mistake of trying to get these papers notarized and translated by a public notary in the US. Don't do this! I came to Vietnam with these papers and they said it was useless and to throw it away and had to rush to make a real appointment for the real documents, with the aid of some lawyers based in the US but had staff physically in Vietnam to help. Luckily everything turned out okay.

So what you need to do is, online, make an appointment to go to the U.S. Consulate, Đại sứ quán, in Saigon or Hanoi for a marriage application. Once there, you can have someone wait outside to hold your stuff for you, there is highland coffee next to the consulate in saigon. What you need to bring inside is your passport and the printed form for the Affidavit of Single Status, Độc Thân and the form for the certified copy of the foreigner's passport, and some money. These are the only two you need to get notarized and each document costs $50 so $100 in total. I recommend bringing cash, like a clean $100 but I believe they also accept debit cards. When entering the consulate, you will pass through security where you leave your phone in a locked box and go into a few rooms with other people waiting for their appointments, such as trying to get their lost passport replaced, interview for entering the US and other marriage applicants. 

Once they call your name, you tell them the purpose of what you are doing there, and you give them the forms and your passport and pay the fee. Wait a bit and then they will come back with documents with the official red stamp and seal. Once that is done, they will ask if you are planning to use this document in Vietnam or outside. Since I was getting married in Vietnam, I said in Vietnam. Then they gave some instructions to go to another government building nearby to authorize the signature. However, I did not do this part personally, because I had a vietnamese lawyer (name of the tax/immigration office was “TOAN VU” from Oakland california).  helped us and they took care of that for us. And they also printed out the forms for us (after we emailed them all our scanned documents) and told us what to sign. And the staff waited outside for me. Their service was $200, which seems fair as they took care of all the paperwork for us. And since I messed up right before, I had to make sure everything was 100% correctly done this time. Unless you are good at Vietnamese law, I’d recommend just paying an expert to do the paperwork and make the appointments for you. Then I waited a day, this staff person came to our hotel and dropped off the documents once the signature authorization was done. So in summary, the two papers that you need notarized with the red stamp at the US embassy/consulate in SGN or HN are the single status paper and the certified copy of passport. Since the form is already in Vietnamese and English, it doesn't need to be translated.

After you have those two documents, go back to your spouse's home province. Make sure you get a photo printout 3x4 cm of your photograph and your spouses’, there are a lot of places that do copy and photographs, they also photoshop to make the photos look professional. The final document you need is the mental health exam. This has to be done at the local hospital, not a big international hospital like vinmec or anything. You don’t need to make appointments, just show up, just that they close on weekends I believe. You can tell that the hospital offers this service since the hospital often has a big board that lists the medical services and marriage mental health exam should be one of them. I read online of someone's experience that they make you put probes and electrical sensors on your brain and take urine tests. We were not subjected to that extent but all we had to do was just take an IQ test, which was the Raven's Progressive Matrices for pattern recognition. You and your spouse go into different rooms and the staff steps out to let you work on the test. Tbh, I finished pretty quickly but my wife was slow at taking the test and so just went into my room and copied my answers, I guess no one noticed or cared 😂. They check your answers to the IQ test, then you go over to the psychologist office where the psychologist reviews your information and asks some basic questions. For example, they asked me, “What is the capital of the US?”, to which I replied quickly, Washington D.C., to make sure I know why I’m there and I’m not dumb. After that, they sign the doctor’s note that you mentally well and not being coerced or anything, attach the face pictures to the paper, and they stamp it and you're good to go.

After you have those 3 documents, go to the People’s district committee, huyện ủy in your spouse’s home province/town. Before you enter the building, make sure you wear pants, same with the US consulate, because they won’t let you in if you wear shorts and flip flops. Then there will be someone that will help you do the marriage application. Once they have everything they will process the marriage application. Normally, for foreigners it takes 3 weeks to get it back, but I was in a rush and needed it done in 3 days before I leave. So my wife asked if it could be done faster, which I thought involved paying bribe money, but tbh, the staff was understanding and didn’t request extra money besides the standard application fee of around 1 million. After they give the completed marriage application back, which is an official government document with red paper, you will get a chance to sign it. I recommend recording it as a lot of people seem to do it on social media. After that you are all set and officially married and that marriage is also legal and recognized in the US also. The whole process is quite cumbersome for a foreigner, at least compared to two local vietnamese marrying, as you have to go to the capital or SG and take some hospital tests. But besides that, if you have external help, and native spouse, the marriage process is pretty straightforward.",37,0.85,43,2025-03-31 04:48:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1jnvgvw/marriage_in_vietnam_as_a_foreigner_experience/,kirsion

Final version of the minimalist tribute poster: The Vietnamese Alphabet.

Big thanks to everyone here who gave feedback over the past month. From critiques to deeper conversations about language and identity—it shaped the final piece more than you know.

Context:
Growing up Viet Kiều, I never formally learned the Vietnamese language—just picked it up at home. At the same time, I was drawn to Swiss & Dutch design. I remember seeing an iconic IKEA poster back in ’99 featuring the Swedish alphabet and wondering: what if that was the Viet alphabet?

Years later, I finally made it. This started as a design exercise, but became something more—a bridge between language, history, and identity. A personal project turned poster, made for my younger self and others who grew up between cultures.

Let me know what you think—and thank you again for being part of the process.",33,0.88,11,2025-04-08 13:16:30,https://i.redd.it/n22q2c2u2mte1.jpeg,Toko12AM

Mình cũng cảm giác họ nghĩ tụi mình giàu lắm, như kiểu sống ở phương Tây là có “money glitch” vậy, nên đôi khi họ cư xử rất khác – kiểu vừa xa cách vừa kỳ vọng.

Mình không biết là cảm giác của mình có đúng không? Có phải nhiều người Việt trong nước thật sự nghĩ như vậy về Việt Kiều không? Hay chỉ là do mình nhạy cảm quá?

Lý Công Uẩn, known as Lý Thái Tổ, founded the Lý Dynasty and ruled from 1010 to 1028. His most enduring decision was to move the capital from Hoa Lư to La Thành, which he renamed Thăng Long—now known as Hanoi. This move marked a pivotal moment in Vietnamese history, shifting the country's political and cultural center to a location that would foster growth and prosperity for centuries to come.

His reign laid the foundation for one of Vietnam's most prosperous dynasties.

2. Boost in Trade and Digital Economy – Agreements signed during the visit aim to enhance trade, green economy, and digital transformation, helping Vietnam integrate further into global supply chains and modernize industries.

3. Stronger Regional Partnerships – Singapore is a key economic partner within ASEAN. Strengthening ties with Singapore enhances Vietnam’s economic resilience, particularly in sectors like logistics, financial services, and smart infrastructure.

There were more domestic routes and international flights to Singapore and Australia. Now it is not as great as before, but prices are still competitive, most of their domestic flights are punctual, on ground and inflight services are still great, and the planes are relatively new.

Đoàn Trần Nghiệp, also known as Ký Con, is remembered as a youthful and courageous revolutionary who rose to prominence in the Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng. Despite his small stature, his commitment to the cause of Vietnamese independence was anything but small. Joining VNQDĐ in 1928, he quickly became a trusted figure, managing party operations and taking part in daring missions against French colonial authorities.

In February 1930, Ký Con led an uprising in Hanoi, coordinating bombings and strikes to weaken the French regime. Even after his capture, he stood firm in his beliefs, declaring his dedication to driving the French out of Vietnam. His execution later that year marked him as one of the first martyrs of Vietnam’s independence movement.

Today, Ký Con is celebrated as a symbol of resilience and determination in Vietnam’s history, inspiring generations to continue the fight for freedom.

The Hùng Vương era, which lasted from approximately 2879 to 258 BC, represents the foundation of Vietnam’s first state, Văn Lang. It’s marked by legendary tales of the 18 Hùng kings—figures deeply woven into Vietnam’s national identity. Their era set the stage for the civilization and nation-building that followed, and it remains a cornerstone of Vietnamese cultural heritage.

VietNam,1k26ifp,Nguyen Trung Truc: A Symbol of Resistance Against French Colonialism,"**Vietnamese Text on the Sign:**  
""Nguyễn Trung Trực (1837 - 1868) quê phủ Tân An, tỉnh Gia Định. Anh hùng dân tộc trong kháng chiến chống Pháp. Năm 1868 bị Pháp bắt và hành hình tại Rạch Giá.""

**Direct English Translation:**  
""Nguyen Trung Truc (1837 - 1868), from Tan An, Gia Dinh province, was a national hero in the resistance against French colonialism. He was captured by the French in 1868 and executed in Rach Gia.""

Nguyen Trung Truc (1838–1868), whose real name was Nguyen Van Lich, is one of the prominent national heroes in the resistance against French colonialism in Southern Vietnam. He was born in Binh Nhat village, Tan An district, Gia Dinh province (now part of Ben Luc district, Long An province) in a family that made a living through fishing.

Nguyen Trung Truc began his resistance activities when the French attacked Gia Dinh in 1859. He joined the resistance movement under the leadership of Truong Dinh and quickly demonstrated his leadership abilities. In 1861, he commanded a group of insurgents in the famous battle at Nhut Tao, where he burned the French ship L’Esperance, achieving a resounding victory.

After years of fighting, he was appointed by the royal court as the Governor of Gia Dinh province and the Commander of Ha Tien. However, after Ha Tien fell in 1867, he withdrew to Rach Gia and continued his resistance efforts at Hon Chong and Phu Quoc.

Nguyen Trung Truc is famous not only for his military achievements but also for his indomitable spirit. He repeatedly refused to surrender under pressure from the French forces. Finally, in October 1868, to protect his guerrilla forces and the people on Phu Quoc Island, he surrendered to the French. He was tried and executed in Rach Gia on October 27, 1868, at the age of 31.

Nguyen Trung Truc is revered by the people as a symbol of patriotism and the spirit of resistance. Many temples have been built to honor him, including those in Rach Gia and Phu Quoc. His image lives on in the hearts of the Vietnamese people as a symbol of resilience against foreign oppression.

Lê Thị Phỉ (Năm Phỉ) became a cultural icon in Southern Vietnam through her groundbreaking contributions to cải lương. Born in Điều Hòa village in what is now Mỹ Tho City, she gained prominence during the 1930s for her exquisite voice, expressive acting, and ability to breathe life into the cải lương stage. Năm Phỉ’s performances not only entertained but also set the standard for generations of artists who followed.

Her talent, creativity, and commitment to her craft elevated cải lương from a regional performance style to a respected art form. Even after her passing in 1954, her influence continues to shape Vietnamese theater and cultural identity.

I sat down next to a Balut vendor lady to eat my Balut. As soon as I did, she moved my backpack a few inches away, placing it against the wall. I heard a thud—my phone had somehow fallen. She quickly picked it up and slid it underneath the tiny chair she had offered me to sit on.

Thing is, I knew for a fact I had placed my phone in the side pocket of my backpack. There was no way it could have just fallen out when she moved my bag. I picked it up, and before I could even put it back in my backpack, she said, ""just leave your phone there,"" as if I should just leave it under the chair.

Yeah, no. The chances of me forgetting my phone that way? Pretty damn high.

VietNam,1jytqu8,🚨 SCAM ALERT in Hanoi – Booking.com,"🚨 **Scam Warning – Avoid This Hanoi Host** 🚨

**Contact Number Used by Host:** \+84 81 204 3887  
**Addresses to Avoid:** 

20 P. Lê Văn Linh, Hàng Mã, Hoàn Kiếm, Hà Nội, Vietnam

Ng. 622 P. Minh Khai, Vĩnh Phú, Hai Bà Trưng, Hà Nội, Vietnam

If you book a hotel through [**Booking.com**](http://Booking.com) and the host changes and sends you to either of the addresses listed above -DO NOT GO. This is part of an ongoing scam.

Here’s what happened to us:

* After booking, he only allowed communication through Whatsapp. We later found out that he will constantly change his number and claim it isn't him when questioned by booking platforms.
* The host provided a new address 30 minutes away from the one listed. When we questioned it, he blamed Booking.com.
* We were threatened with full charges if we tried to cancel, leaving us feeling trapped.
* Later, we were moved again to a new property in the Old Quarter—this time, it only had one bed (we had booked two).
* The promised “free airport shuttle” was only available if we booked a tour through him.
* We were asked to pay via a third-party link, not through Booking.com.
* We never met the host in person; he made coffee shop workers check us in and would tell them instructions through the phone.
* When we left a bad review, the host contacted us from another WhatsApp number to insult us and laugh that we got scammed.

He continually changes listing names, addresses, and numbers, making it hard for platforms to hold him accountable. He will mark you as a no-show and claim that it wasn't him communicating with you.

⚠️ **Avoid this host at all costs.** Spread the word so others don’t go through the same thing.

We booked her apartment more than a month in advance, and she had many weeks to inform us but chose not to.

We refused, and if we canceled, the payment for the booking was non-refundable. #AirBnb supported us in not having to pay any extra fees, as this was a scam, and it was against/broke their policy.

When the host did not get her scam payments \[btw she stopped by the apartment many times with different people demanding cash payments throughout our stay which made it very hard to relax there\] she wrote some disgusting statements about myself and my family in a message, and in retaliation, I replied with a F++K you scamming B++ch \[I was upset reading her insults and after dealing with her behavior\].

My account was then suspended, and I was sent an email from AirBnb customer support, a statement to inform me of this, along with scathing feedback posted about us on AirBnb by the scammer host regarding our character and us in a very personal targeted way.

How is it possible to have this public posted feedback out us by a host that was unsuccessful in scamming their guest even allowed to be there?

Forget letting future guests know about a bad experience, best to keep it to yourself, and forget using AirBNB at all. Too many better more protected, ethical options available.

Ngô Quyền (898–944) pulled off one of the most legendary military upsets in Vietnamese history. In 938, he lured the Southern Han fleet into the Bach Dang River and annihilated them using hidden wooden stakes—ending 1,000 years of Chinese rule. A year later, he crowned himself king, kicking off a new chapter of Vietnamese self-rule.

The whole trip with a private driver to take me to and from Saigon was below $500, this total includes food and three night stay. We ordered room service a few times as well. Went to a vegetarian restaurant down the street. We also had two hours of spa service. The room we stayed in had the private balcony. We had a private patio with an okay jacuzzi. Was not Hawaii, but also did not pay  Hawaii prices. Would do it again. Great peaceful spot with beach access. A nice place to get away from the city for a few days.

Remember the fake milk powder case? That news was covered a lot these days but have you noticed that NONE OF THE FAKE BRANDS were named? My mother was asking me if the milk she bought was indeed one of them? Of course, I couldn’t know because they did not say it publicly on TV. Why did they leave out such a vital piece of information.

This is not the only case. The other day, they broadcast news on unsafe food served on the street. They came to the storage, examined the original packages. And guess what, none of the packages were named, either. The location of the food stalls were not mentioned, either. 

Today, the news talked about the drugs/food that are not on the MOH’s list. Again, none was named. Then they talked about a pre-school facility that violently abused some kids. Guess what, that preschool was not named. How am I supposed to avoid and boycott it if I don’t even know its name? This should be the first information to show.

This level of vagueness is alarming. This is why school abuses and food poisoning have been going on undetected and unsolved for years. The news informed us but nothing is valuable to us. There was nothing named, we don’t know what and where to avoid anymore. There was nothing specific so we thought to ourselves “Oh, I guess we are safe, the problems are being suffered by someone else” and then ignored them entirely over time.",13,0.65,26,2025-04-21 20:39:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1k4o0os/the_level_of_vagueness_in_the_news_is_insane/,brevity142

VietNam,1k06kqk,Nguyễn Trãi: Vietnam’s National Hero and Cultural Icon,"“Nguyễn Trãi (1380 - 1442) hiệu Ức Trai, là anh hùng dân tộc Việt Nam, danh nhân văn hóa Thế giới. “Bình Ngô đại cáo” do ông viết, được xem là bản tuyên ngôn độc lập thứ hai của Việt Nam - đời vua Lê Thái Tổ.”

Direct English Translation:
“Nguyễn Trãi (1380–1442), known as Ức Trai, was a national hero and world cultural figure. His work “Bình Ngô Đại Cáo” is regarded as the second declaration of independence in Vietnam during the reign of King Lê Thái Tổ.”

—

Nguyễn Trãi, known by the pen name Ức Trai, was one of Vietnam’s most important historical figures. His role as a strategist during the Lam Sơn Uprising and his authorship of “Bình Ngô Đại Cáo,” considered Vietnam’s second declaration of independence, cemented his legacy as both a national hero and a cultural icon.

Nguyễn Trãi was more than a military leader. His works, including “Quân trung từ mệnh tập,” “Ức Trai thi tập,” and “Dư địa chí,” demonstrate a profound understanding of Vietnamese politics, culture, and geography. These writings reveal his vision of a just and independent Vietnam, blending Confucian, Buddhist, and Taoist philosophies to promote a humane and equitable society.

Despite his contributions, Nguyễn Trãi faced tragedy in the Lệ Chi Viên incident, where he was wrongfully accused of regicide, leading to his family’s execution. Years later, King Lê Thánh Tông posthumously exonerated him, recognizing his invaluable service to the nation.

Nguyễn Trãi’s influence endures not only through his literature and political philosophy but also as a symbol of patriotism, resilience, and intellect. His works and legacy remain a cornerstone of Vietnamese cultural and national identity.

Lê Lợi (1385–1433) is one of Vietnam’s most celebrated national heroes. Leading the Lam Sơn uprising against the Ming occupation, he waged a decade-long resistance that ultimately reclaimed Vietnamese independence in 1428. As the first emperor of the Later Lê Dynasty, he implemented reforms that strengthened the nation and solidified its sovereignty. His leadership and determination remain legendary in Vietnamese history.

VietNam,1jt6d0k,A Kind Soul at Hoa Lu Festival: Our Nighttime Rescue by Quy Nguyen,"We were at the Hoa Lu Festival 2025 in Ninh Binh, and the day was filled with emotions, surrounded by thousands of people celebrating. That same afternoon, Quy Nguyen, who we met through Tam Coc Queen’s Travel, had brought us to our hotel, which was about 15 minutes from the city. Before leaving, he handed us his card with a warm smile—a small gesture that, at the time, seemed like nothing more than a kind formality. Little did we know how much it would mean later on.
By around 11 p.m., with the festival still in full swing, there wasn’t a single taxi available to take us back to the hotel. Running out of options, I decided to text Quy, even though I knew he was likely resting after a long day. To our surprise, he replied almost immediately and, without hesitation, came to pick us up. Seeing him arrive, with the same calm and kindness he’d shown earlier, brought us such a sense of relief. He drove us back to the hotel, charging only the regular fare, as if it were the most natural thing in the world.
That moment really touched us. On such a hectic day, coming across someone like Quy, who went out of his way to help with so much generosity and humanity, even late at night, was something truly special. It’s such a blessing that there are still people like him out there, who, with simple acts of kindness, remind us of the value of caring for others.

Đỗ Trình Thoại (… - 1861) emerged as a key figure in Vietnam’s early resistance against French colonization. Serving as the district chief of Long Thành, he played a pivotal role in mobilizing local forces and forging alliances with prominent leaders such as Trương Định and Nguyễn Hữu Huân.

Sacrificing his life in the Battle of Gò Công, Đỗ Trình Thoại left behind a legacy of patriotism and determination. Despite the uncertainty surrounding his exact birth year, his actions resonate as a symbol of resilience during a period of great national upheaval.

You can also pay for a fast track service, but I didn't so I'm not able to answer any questions about that.

There will be many sim kiosks starting after immigration and around baggage claim. I exited baggage claim/customs and got cash from one of the ATMs near the exit doors. Again, there will be more sim kiosks next to the ATMs. I'm not sure if these kiosks have eSIMs though.

After getting cash I walked all the way to the left to the dedicated Viettel store, where they had a sign announcing they had eSIMs available. I bought their 20 day unlimited data package. I apologize but I don't remember how much it was in VND but it was around $14 USD.

They asked me for my passport and took pictures of my face to verify my identity against my passport. They did the entire setup for me. Took about 10 minutes.

TLDR: exit baggage claim, turn left, go to the dedicated Viettel store and get your eSIM there

So far so good with Viettel, it's been fast data speeds and no problem with signal. The eSIM also comes with a phone number. Hope it helps!",10,0.82,5,2025-03-25 03:16:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1jja0se/guide_esim_at_sgn_airport/,dinobonoid

VietNam,1jvvair,Nguyễn Bỉnh Khiêm: Vietnam’s 16th-Century Philosopher-Seer,"“Nguyễn Bỉnh Khiêm (1491 - 1585) người làn Trung Am, huyện Vĩnh Lại (nay thuộc huyện Vĩnh Bảo ngoại thành Hải Phòng). Ông là nhà triết học lớn của Việt Nam thế kỷ XVI.”

Nguyễn Bỉnh Khiêm (1491–1585) wasn’t just a philosopher—he was the oracle of his time. Known for his deep wisdom and cryptic prophecies, he lived through one of Vietnam’s most chaotic eras and somehow made sense of it all. Officials, scholars, and even warlords sought his counsel. Today, he’s remembered not only for his poetry and moral teachings, but also for predictions that people still debate centuries later.

I didn’t think much of it and paid by credit card. I tried to buy a return ticket to Hanoi from Sapa and online it was 92 USD (2.3 million VND) but my card was declined so we went to the station to pay by cash. At the station the price for the return tickets were only 27 USD (700K VND) for both of us, I couldn’t believe it! We double checked that it was a sleeping cabin and they confirmed it was.

VietNam,1k1esko,Nguyễn Tri Phương: The Unyielding Defender of Vietnam,"Vietnamese Text on the Sign:
“Nguyễn Tri Phương (1800 - 1873) Là một đại danh thần nhà Nguyễn. Ông là vị tổng chỉ huy quân đội Triều Nguyễn chống lại quân Pháp xâm lược ở Đà Nẵng (1858), Gia Định (1861), Hà Nội (1873).”

Direct English Translation:
“Nguyễn Tri Phương (1800–1873) was a prominent official of the Nguyễn dynasty. He served as the Commander-in-Chief of the Nguyễn army, leading the defense against French invaders in Da Nang (1858), Gia Dinh (1861), and Hanoi (1873).”

Nguyễn Tri Phương (1800–1873), a key figure in Vietnam’s history, emerged as a steadfast defender during some of the most critical moments in the Nguyễn dynasty. Born in Thừa Thiên - Huế, his brilliant military strategies and unyielding spirit are best known from his leadership during the French invasions. From the first attacks in Da Nang to his final stand in Hanoi, Nguyễn Tri Phương exemplified resilience, refusing to yield even in the face of certain defeat.

Captured and gravely wounded, Nguyễn Tri Phương’s final act of defiance—refusing to submit or cooperate with the French—cemented his legacy as a symbol of patriotism and honor. His sacrifices and determination live on as a testament to Vietnam’s enduring fight for sovereignty and independence.

VietNam,1jxbgkz,Real estate prices in Vietnam seem off on popular websites — anyone else feel the same?,"Hello everyone,

I'm a Vietnamese citizen currently living in the U.S., and I already own properties in Trà Vinh and Vĩnh Long, so I’m not new to the property game in Vietnam. Lately, I’ve been looking at buying more real estate back home for investment and I’ve been browsing all the usual sites: Batdongsan, Chotot, Homedy, etc.

But here’s the thing: the prices on those sites just don’t feel right. Some listings have stayed up for *months* with no changes, some prices seem super inflated, and then others are suspiciously low. It’s hard to tell what’s real and what’s just bait to get your attention.

Here’s what I’ve noticed or found out:

* A lot of listings are outdated or already sold, but they’re left up to attract leads.
* Some agents intentionally list fake or low prices to get you to call them.
* The same property can be listed by multiple agents with different photos, descriptions, and even totally different prices.
* Vietnam doesn’t have a public MLS (Multiple Listing Service) like in the U.S., so there’s no official way to verify the actual transaction price unless you know someone on the inside.

Has anyone else run into this?

* How do y’all verify prices when buying from overseas?
* Are there any trusted agents or platforms you recommend?
* Or is this just how the real estate game works in VN?

In the west we have hospice care, where morphine can be administered orally throughout the day, to ease the suffering of the patient. My wife asked the doctor about it and he doesn't seem to understand. He thinks we mean injecting morphine. He's suggesting my MIL get in a taxi, come to his office once a day and get a morphine shot. The shot would only last a few hours. This is not an option, we need the oral morphine to administer hospice care, at her house while she is on her deathbed.

VietNam,1jn9pdr,Solo Ha Giang Loop (March 2025 Update),"I just finished the loop a few days ago. Here’s my experience summed up in one post for those who want the most up-to-date and complete information.

I won’t go into much detail about the loop itself or which routes to take, as that’s been covered by hundreds of blog posts. Just this: Do the loop counterclockwise. Most tours go clockwise, so going the other way gives you a better chance of having roads and spots to yourself.

How Experienced Do You Have to Be?

While researching, I found many sources claiming the roads are terrible and that you need to be an experienced driver. While bad roads exist, if you stick to the main ones, it really shouldn’t be a problem. If you’ve never ridden a motorbike before, you’re probably better off ~~overpaying~~ booking an Easy Rider. But if you have some experience, I’d say go for it—you’ll have the time of your life.

For me, this was my first major motorbike tour. I had plenty of experience riding scooters in Southeast Asia but very little with semi-automatics. Since you’ll need one for the loop, I practiced for a day in Da Nang, which helped a lot.

Getting There

Ha Giang (the start and end point of the loop) is about a 6-hour bus ride from Hanoi. I booked a ticket online a few hours in advance on a random bus website. I recommend taking a late morning bus, so you arrive in the evening with enough time to find a place to stay, rent a bike, and ease into it.

Packing

Pack as light as possible. Most hostels/hotels allow you to leave your main bag behind. It gets cold, so pack accordingly—I underestimated this and caught a cold on day 2.

Getting a Bike

You’ll find bikes for rent everywhere in Ha Giang. If you have a preference, do some research and message rental shops on WhatsApp in advance. I went with a Honda Future 125cc—a classic choice that gets the job done.

I don’t have a valid international driver’s license, so some places wouldn’t rent to me. However, I do have a Thai license, which is valid in Vietnam, though some shops still didn’t accept it. Ultimately, I had no trouble finding a rental. If you plan to rent without a proper license, bring cash. Which brings me to the next point...

Traffic Police & Fines

If you’re riding without a valid license:

Small bikes → fines up to 3M VND

Big bikes → fines up to 9M VND

I met a guy with a big bike and a valid license who got stopped almost every day. It seems police target big bikes because of the higher fines. In general, traffic stops are random, usually in small villages along main roads.

Some people never got stopped, while others did a few times. I passed four police checkpoints and got stopped once on day 2. They asked where I was from, I showed my Thai license, and that was it. Still, I kept some cash in my back pocket just in case.

My take on this: If you’re riding illegally in Southeast Asia, you’re accepting the risk (e.g., no insurance coverage). Just pay up and move on—it’s basically a road tax. Also, if you get fined, you’ll receive a receipt, meaning you won’t be fined again on the same trip.

5 Days vs. 4 Days (vs. 3 Days)

You can do the loop in three days, but where’s the fun in that? My girlfriend and I took our time and did 5 days. The best roads are away from the main routes, so if you can, set aside extra time to explore.

Have a rough plan but stay flexible—if you see a cool road or hear about a great route from someone at your homestay, go for it. Just be prepared for some rough roads, which can actually make for the best memories.

Homestays & Hotels

There are plenty of cool places to stay—and a lot of extremely dull ones. Do your research and book what suits you. We usually booked one day in advance via Booking, which worked smoothly.

Try to avoid places where big tour groups go—unless you enjoy drunk 21-year-olds singing the same 10 karaoke songs every night. Most of the spots we stayed at had other solo travelers doing the loop, so we met great people along the way.
