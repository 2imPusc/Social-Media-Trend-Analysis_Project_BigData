travel,1jq6ezf,Angola and Namibia in two weeks - am I mad?,"Hi all - looking to be talked down (or up!) on a potential itinerary.

We live in São Paulo, Brazil and are off to a wedding in Lisbon in the summer. We’d been looking at an adventurous journey back via Luanda - a chance to go to Angola and take advantage of being Portuguese speakers.

While messing around on flightconnections.com, however, I’ve spotted that TAAG has reasonable connections to Windhoek - with an option to go on to São Paulo via Johannesburg. Namibia has long been on our list and this is probably the closest we’re going to get.

Would combining both be madness? We’ll have a couple of weeks and I was thinking (perhaps) 4-6 days in Luanda to get a sense of Angola and do an excursion, and then sink the rest of the time into some of the natural beauty of Namibia. We’re not massive adventure tourists. 

We’re reasonably cash-rich for flights but time poor, hence the ambitious itinerary… ",4,0.83,15,2025-04-03 02:01:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jq6ezf/angola_and_namibia_in_two_weeks_am_i_mad/,LordNorminator
travel,1jppaq2,Best alternative to Google My Maps?,"Hey guys! 

During the past several years, I’ve been using Google My Maps / Google Maps to plan my travel itineraries and daily activities. I have also seen some other travellers recommending it here on this sub. 

That said, there are some issues/flaws that are very frustrating to me:

- When opening your “My Map” on Google Maps, Google Maps basic features become unavailable, such as seeing location pictures, reviews, etc. I end up having to close Google Maps entirely so I can get out of the “My Maps” section.

- You are unable to make any changes to your maps, apart from enabling or disabling different layers. I generally use layers to plan different days, but would appreciate the option to adjust things on the fly if needed.

- The actual Google My Maps platform on desktop is quite limiting, and outdated.

I have also tried just using Google Maps instead, saving the different places I’d like to visit. A similar thing seems to happen though, and sometimes the places I saved just come up as GPS coordinates on a map instead of the actual place name.

Any alternatives would be highly appreciated. Thank you!",6,1.0,2,2025-04-02 14:01:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jppaq2/best_alternative_to_google_my_maps/,DundieAwardsWinner

travel,1jov3e3,Barcelona to Montserrat day trip - your advice on planning and ticketing?,"Hi all,

I'm visiting Montserrat from Barcelona with my mother on Wednesday 9 April and I would really appreciate and benefit from some help planning for the day. So thank you in advance.

For context, we are travelling there on our own by public transport (R5 line and cable car). We plan to visit the Montserrat Monastery (not watching Boy's choir), museum, have lunch, and take the funiculars up/down for the views.

So far, I have seen multiple people suggesting the Trans Montserrat Card/ToT Montserrat Card and we are planning to get the Trans card to cover all core transport and entry to the Monasterry. However, it also says on Barcelona's Turisme's website, that *access to the Black Madonna and basilica is included, no pre-booking required but ticket holders must queue for entry*.

My question here is:

1. As no pre-booking is required, is entry still guaranteed and we can do it anytime of the day? How long should we expect the wait to be?
2. Approximately how long would it take to visit the whole the Monastery, if we are not queuing to see the Black Madonna?
3. Is the Museum worth seeing?
4. . Aware that there will be a lot of groups and tours, what's the best way to plan for the day to avoid the crowd? Should we start with the funiculars and get the views early then visit the Monasterry after 2:30/3:00pm assuming it will be a little less crowded as the groups start to leave?
5. Finally, do you have any suggestions of decent restaurants/coffee shops at Montserrat?

Thank you so much!",4,0.84,2,2025-04-01 13:04:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jov3e3/barcelona_to_montserrat_day_trip_your_advice_on/,ZealousidealAd5375

My question to you experts is: would it be worth it to book everything ourselfs?  (flight tickets, rental car and 8 nights in multiple spots in Iceland, i think 4 different hotels?) Is it possible in Iceland to just drive, and see at which hotel you end up? Or will everything be booked in September 2025?

travel,1jneicz,Traveling to Istanbul & Cappadocia Region,"Hi Everyone,

I’m planning a trip to Turkey, specifically Istanbul and Cappadocia, from June 7 to June 16. I’d love some advice on a few things:

1. Traveling from Istanbul to Göreme

What’s the best option—taking a flight or an overnight bus?
I’ve read about shuttle services from the airport to the hotel. How reliable are they, and what’s the approximate cost?

2. Hot Air Balloon Suggestions

Which hot air balloon company would you recommend for the best experience? I’ve heard the cost is around €220—is that accurate?
Are there any trusted operators that offer better deals or packages?

3. Red and Green Tours in Cappadocia

How much do the Red Tour and Green Tour typically cost?
Any suggestions on which tour offers the best value for money?

4. Return from Göreme to Istanbul

Would taking a bus back to Istanbul be a good idea for a different experience?
How comfortable and safe are the overnight buses on this route?
Are there day bus services that leave in the morning and reach Istanbul by evening? If so, how do they compare in terms of comfort and duration?

I’m traveling from India and prefer budget-friendly options, so any information about costs in euros would be really helpful.

Looking forward to your suggestions and insights!",2,0.67,7,2025-03-30 15:10:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jneicz/traveling_to_istanbul_cappadocia_region/,Conscious-Sugar-4912

	•	A bit of history and culture (but not trying to museum-hop all day)
	•	Relaxed vibes—some beach or nature time would be amazing
	•	Great food and wine, of course
	•	A little bit of nightlife is a bonus, but not a must

A few questions:
	•	Is it better to stick to one area (like the east coast/Catania/Taormina), or try to see both sides of the island?
	•	Any can’t-miss towns, beaches, or food experiences?
	•	Would renting a car be essential for a trip this length?

travel,1jm0w4v,Advice needed for 5D Montenegro itinerary,"Hey guys, I am having a hard time planning out my Montenegro trip and would love some advice. I'll be landing in Podgorica in May and will have 5 whole days to enjoy Montenegro before heading to Albania. This is what I have planned so far:

**Day 1:** Half day exploring Podgorica's Old Town, before taking the bus to Kotor in the afternoon. Remaining time spent exploring Kotor's Old Town and hiking the city walls.  
**Day 2:** Half day trip to Perast in the morning *(need some advice regarding how to get there)*, before returning to Kotor and then going back to Podgorica  
**Day 3:** Day trip to Lake Skadar and Budva / Sveti Stefan from Podgorica (thinking of this option: https://balkanadventure.me/tours/skadar-lake-day-tour/)  
**Day 4:** Day trip to Korita / Grlo Sokolovo lookout point from Podgorica  
**Day 5:** Half day in Podgorica before taking the bus to Tirana, Albania

Lastly, I'm not planning to drive because we drive on the other side in my country and I'm not experienced enough to confidently drive in Montenegro. However, I'm still keen to visit Lake Skadar and the Sveti Stefan lookout, and if time permits, the Grlo Sokolovo lookout point. I would much prefer to hike at Lake Skadar to see it from above but so far I haven't found any tours that bring us up instead of just boating on the lake.

Has anyone done a large group trip (multiple families/16ish people) in Japan or South East Asia (Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand) in August before?  We're trying to figure out which would be a better location to go to for a short 9 day trip having visited neither before.  Both are of course great places to go, but we have some concerns with both locations.

For Japan, we're concerned about the heat and the crowds.  And 9 days feels like a short time to visit Japan.  We feel that Japan might be better saved for when we have 2 weeks or so to visit.

While for countries like Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand, we're concerned about the showers ruining trip plans since August is monsoon season for them.  It's documented that the showers typically last for \~1 hour if they happen in the day, but we're not sure how bad it'll be if we get caught outside during them.  We're also concerned about potential gloomy weather.

We're looking for a place to experience good vegetarian food, culture, activities, and site seeing.  We've disregarded most of Europe since some in the group have visited the major countries there.  We initially planned for Greece but decided against it due to earthquake warnings in Santorini.

Anyone have an opinion on which would be better?  Or if neither are recommended, any alternative suggestions that have good vegetarian food, culture, activities, and site seeing?

I'm hoping still for something a little more relaxed than the Lima-based day tours, like this:

\-Saturday morning bus from Lima to Huacachina

\-lounge in the hotel pool during the hot hours

\-sand-boarding at 4pm

\-watch sunset from atop the dunes

\-dinner and parties!

\-Sunday late morning bus to Paracas

\-ceviche lunch in town

\-walk around the desert in the afternoon for a couple hours to see Mirador Istmo II and nearby sights at my own pace (is there an alternative to tours?  Does Uber work there?).  Also, is is too hot in May to do an extended walk in the afternoon?

\-take the last bus back to Lima (17:40-21:25)

\-Monday 10:45am flight home... Am I cutting it too close with the last bus back to Lima from Paracas the evening before?  Do the buses sometimes get cancelled?  Maybe it'll be better peace of mind to be in Lima the evening before the flight...

I keep hearing about the Ballestas islands boat excursions, but it doesn't appeal to me as much as landscapes in solitude and a more relaxed pace.  Am I really missing out?

I have an upcoming trip with an Iberia flight from Chicago to Portugal, with a layover in Madrid, and I’m getting nervous. I’m generally not a nervous flyer, but I’ve never flown with Iberia before and have recently heard they’re famous for the amount of luggage they lose, especially when there’s a MAD layover. Based on LuggageLosers, they’re almost always in the top 5 (if not #1) in terms of baggage lost.

I do have to check a bag and although I definitely plan to stick an AirTag in there, I keep stressing about the likelihood of them losing my bag and everything inside! It also sounds like it’s incredibly difficult to get them to actually reunite you with your bag even with the location sharing, and in all honesty I would rather not spend my vacation constantly on the phone trying to explain the situation to their CS agents. 

Any reassurance or recommendations to help stop me from stressing over this? Should I just expect them to lose my bag and be happy when they don’t? ",3,0.71,20,2025-04-20 04:12:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k3e9mv/iberia_luggage_woes/,sushi-potato

travel,1k2owe6,Advice for Borneo / Orangutans,"My girlfriend and I are going to Borneo in mid-May. But we are having trouble trying to decide how to best spend a few day, focused on seeing orangutans.

We are starting in Kuala Lumpur on Sunday and need to be in Kota Kinabalu by Friday at noon for a 3D2N Mount Kinabalu (dates are fixed and can’t be changed). So we have 4–5 nights to work with beforehand.

While we booked a 3N orangutan river cruise in Tanjung Puting (Indonesia with Orangutan Days) the logistics are starting to make me question if this is the best use of time, as we would need to:

* Fly KUL–CGK (Sunday) Overnight in Jakarta
* Fly CGK–PKN (Monday)
* PKN–CGK (Thursday), followed by CGK–BKI 
* However, the nonstop CGK-BKI was just canceled by AirAsia so now it would be CGK–KUL–BKI

So now we’re considering skipping Indonesia altogether and staying within Malaysian Borneo. 

Have been looking at either the Kinabatangan Wetlands Resort or Sukau Rainforest Lodge since we can fly direct KUL-SDK and then SDK-BKI. Considering 2N or 3N options there. 

I’m also intrigued by Borneo Rainforest Lodge, although it’s very expensive and might be tough to squeeze in time-wise between Sunday and Thursday.

Wondering what advice people have here

1. Should we stick to the original plan even though it's requires 5 flights? We were excited about the boat journey
2. How does Kinabatangan compare? Thoughts between the two resorts?
3. Is it worth the effort/expense to try to make Danum Valley work? Can we do both this and Kinabatangan in this time window?

**Days 1 - 3** - **Dublin** (3 nights)
> * Arrival at noon / Half-day + 1 Full day to explore
> * 1 Day trip: *Belfast* (2 hours each way) OR *Cliffs of Moher* (3 hours each way)

> * Half-day + 2 Full days to explore (Jordaan District, Rotterdam, Utrecht, etc). Spending my birthday here.

**Day 8 - 10**: **Brussels** (3 nights) - *Train from Amsterdam*
> * Half Day + Full day to explore
> * 1 Day trip: *Bruges* or *Ghent* or *Antwerp*

**Day 14** - **Return to Dublin** (1 night) - *Flight from Paris*

**Day 15** - **Departure**

travel,1k17tkn,Why nobody is going to Java? (Also please help with travel plans),"Hello everyone!

I'm trying to plan a trip to Java for two weeks (Apr 27 — May 11). After some research it seems 95% of travelers in Java are domestic tourists, and the other 5% are people going on tours from Bali for a couple of days.

Why are there so few independent international travelers in Java? Am I missing smth or is it just undiscovered yet?

Some context: I'm a female solo traveller and I'm white so my main concern is safety and just being comfortable — I don't enjoy standing out too much.

First version of my itinerary looked like this:

Yogyakarta (4 nights) (flying in)  
Dieng Plateau (6 nights)  
Yogyakarta (1 night)  
Train from Yogyakarta to Probolinggo, then transfer to Cemoro Lawang  
Cemoro Lawang (3 nights)  
Transfer from Cemoro Lawang to Surabaya (to fly out)

I'm mostly interested in nature, the island seems out of this world with all the volcanoes and waterfalls. I thought i could stay in Dieng and do some hiking, maybe rent a scooter and explore.

Now I'm thinking of skipping the Dieng Plateau because it looks too remote and it seems not many international travellers go there. Should this be a concern?

Should I go to Malang and/or Banyuwangi instead?

I've been planning to use public transportation (trains, buses) to get around. I can also drive a scooter if the traffic is not too crazy. Not a fan of group tours but it looks like there aren't many other budget-friendly options for some attractions such as Ijen.

Please help me figure this out. Any advice will be appreciated.

P.S. One more question: how big are the Labour Day celebrations? Should I be worried about hotels/tickets because of increase in travel during the holidays?

EDIT: I understand that popular places such as Jogja, Bromo, Ijen see a lot of international tourists. My main concern is with less popular areas. 

My understanding of Java being somewhat under the radar comes from research: there is little popular travel content about the island on Youtube etc. ",3,0.57,44,2025-04-17 08:28:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k17tkn/why_nobody_is_going_to_java_also_please_help_with/,ilyazd

I’m a Moroccan passport holder flying soon from Casablanca to Bangkok with a layover in Beijing (under 24 hours).  
I plan to use the 24-hour visa-free transit (TWOV) policy in China, which I know applies to Moroccan citizens. I already have a confirmed onward ticket from Beijing to Bangkok, but the problem is:

\-And I won’t have the boarding pass for the Beijing–Bangkok flight when I check in at Casablanca

I’ve heard that in such cases, Chinese immigration may allow a temporary entry permit to collect luggage and re-check for the onward flight.

My concern is this: Will I be blocked at the Casablanca airport check-in desk if I don’t have a Chinese visa and I’m transiting on separate tickets?

Have any other nationalities faced issues with this kind of setup — like being asked for a visa or denied boarding at their origin airport (especially with separate tickets)?

travel,1jzewyr,"2-week itinerary for Germany, Czechia, Austria & Switzerland – too much?","Hi everyone! I’m planning a two-week trip through Germany, Czechia, Austria, and Switzerland in late September and would really appreciate any advice or suggestions. We’re a group of four young guys (late 20s), all pretty easygoing and looking for a good mix of culture, sights, food, beer, and fun. Definitely want some nightlife here and there, but also enjoy spending time in nature and just generally soaking up the atmosphere in new places.

To give a bit of context: the trip is centered around two major events: I'll be in Berlin to support a friend running the marathon (Sept 21), and then heading to Munich for Oktoberfest (Sept 25–27). Beyond those two fixed points, we’re still figuring out the rest of the route and wondering if we’re squeezing too much in or missing any gems.

Here’s the rough plan so far:

**Sept 19–22: Berlin**  
Arrival. Planning to stay a few days to explore the city and cheer on my friend in the Berlin Marathon. No set itinerary yet for Berlin, so open to ideas!

**Sept 22–25: Prague**  
We’ll head to Prague for a couple of days. Again, nothing really planned yet.

**Sept 25–27: Munich**  
Back to Germany for Oktoberfest. We’ve already got accommodations sorted here.

**Sept 28–Oct 3: ??**  
This is where things are still flexible. We were thinking about doing something like:

* Salzburg for a night or two (it’s so close to Munich, seems like a no-brainer)
* Then maybe head to Innsbruck, and finally Lucerne to end the trip
* We’d fly out of Frankfurt on Oct 3, so we’d need to factor in travel time back there

My main question: does this feel too rushed? We want to see a good mix of cities and scenic spots, but also don’t want to spend half the trip on trains or feeling burnt out. Also curious if anyone has suggestions for places we might be overlooking (or that aren’t worth the time).

Thanks in advance for your help!",3,0.8,7,2025-04-15 00:47:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jzewyr/2week_itinerary_for_germany_czechia_austria/,cparosh

I have a question about how Spain's train system works. I bought a RENFE ALVO train ticket for April 21st from Barcelona to Seville through the RENFE website. I have a few questions: 

1) When buying a ticket, I wrote my passport number in the option where the ID number was requested (I am Turkish, I wrote my Turkish passport number.) but the ""nationality"" option did not appear. Is there such an option or is it enough to just write my passport number as it is? 

2) Is there a place, person, kiosk etc. at Barcelona Sants Station where I need to validate my ticket or is it enough to just get on the train? 

3) The ticket came to me in PDF format. I printed that ticket in black and white. Will printing it without color cause problems when I am asked for my ticket?

4) Also the trains route will be Barcelona - Madrid then Madrid - Seville. How is the train change in Madrid train station?",3,1.0,8,2025-04-14 17:29:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jz4n68/some_questions_about_train_systems_on_spain/,According_Gene_5269

travel,1jyikm5,Lisbon/Cascais/Sintra trip- does it make sense to make Cascais our home base?,"Planning a trip to Portugal in June. We have 9 days in the country. The three major parts we want to see are Sintra (day trip), Cascais, and Lisbon. We want the flexibility in our trip to be able to spend time relaxing at pools/beaches, while also seeing the major city. Because of this, we are contemplating making Cascais our home base and choosing a nice resort to stay in that area, and traveling to Sintra/Lisbon from there. 

We’d want to do 2-3 days in Lisbon, a day in Sintra, and the rest of the time in Cascais, mainly because it seems central to all spots and we can relax a bit. It also gives us flexibility if we do decide we want to relax one day, we’re not stuck in such a city atmosphere. Does it make sense to stay at a resort in Cascais the whole time, or would you say it’s necessary to spend a couple nights in a hotel in Lisbon? From what I can tell, the train from Cascais to Lisbon is about 45 minutes, so I don’t think it would be a problem to do this a couple of separate times. The bus from Cascais to Sintra looks to be about 25 minutes.

Unfortunately, I’ll need to have a surgery consultation, so I have to travel to France. I’ll be staying there between June 19–24. The consultation will be in Montpellier, and my girlfriend and I will arrive by plane in Marseille.

Since I’ll be spending a few days there anyway, I’d like to see some beautiful places. I’m not sure how warm the sea is around that time, but it would be great to go for a swim since we’ll be near the coast.

Nice seems like a much more interesting city, but based on videos, the sea looks like it has strong currents. I’m not sure if it’s suitable for swimming.

travel,1jvuory,2 weeks Nicaragua vs. Mexico City & Oaxaca,"Hi!  
I'm a 20s Male, and got roughly 2 weeks I want to spend in Central America in the 2nd half of July (2nd half), as a solo backpacker.  
I'm conflicted between doing Nicaragua (maybe combined with a few days in El Salvador), vs. Mexico City + Oaxaca. Will be flying from and to Boston.  
For Nicaragua, I was eyeing Leon, San Juan del Sur, Granada, Masaya, Ometepe and Corn Island (weather-permitting). For CDMX and Oaxaca, I suppose around 1 week in each is a good amount, but haven't done any research yet, so I'm open to any suggestions of nearby towns to stay at/visit as well.

Nicaragua is definitely cheaper and better for my budget (including the flights) and might have a more chill backpacker vibe to it, but the food and culture/history part seem to be better in Central/Pacific Mexico. I understand there is a festival in Oaxaca during July (Guelaguetza) so it might be a bit too crowded but could also be fun, and the food in this region is a big draw. I'm guessing safety is rather similar between the two.

I've already been to Central America (Costa Rica, Caribbean Mexico, Belize, Guatemala (just Tikal tho) and Cuba) and also South America (Peru, Colombia), I can speak Spanish, and my interests are hiking, food, culture (temples, ruins), more food, nature and meeting other ppl/locals (so if there are other backpackers as well it's definitely a bonus), and am a pretty fast-paced traveler. Not too much into museums (history is fine), and I don't surf if that makes any difference.

in my family, each of us must take medication for personal use. Altogether we have about 10 different ones. I am always worried that this may cause problems when travelling to other countries. Next trip: probably China.

We all know that it differs from country to country what is considered a normal medication, controlled substance, or illegal drug. What can be a a normal medication in one place could in the worst case be illegal in another. Especially when it comes to regions that are known for hard drug laws I am worried. I've read reports of people sent to jail (or worse) for carrying painkillers, e.g. in Egypt. I didn't yet read it about China, but it is known for hard drug laws.

How do you handle this? Can the embassy certify in advance that you are allowed to bring it?

Obviously, I am googling. But I find the default answer ""bring your doctor's prescription"" unsatisfying. If a substance is illegal, a letter written by someone (a stranger to the customs) from the other side of the world will hardly change that. If a doctors prescribes you marihuana, it will still be illegal in those countries. As a laymen I know this about marihuana - but how should I know which of the long list of medical incredients (many of which with multiple names) could also be problematic?

Cons: both trips require a 2 hour layover making it a 6 hour total flight both ways with plane swaps. Also, this flight time is not ideal with an early departure at 0500. The next option is Volaris. The Pros: it is a direct flight at a convenient time for me. Cons: I've heard rumors that the quality of the airline is subpar, and that the trips are sometimes cancelled at the last minute. The pricing for this flight is $307 on a website called ""Kiwi"" that I haven't heard of. If anyone could share their experience with this airline or the booking website? Also, there is no carry-on option. The third option is AeroMexico. Pros: Its a direct flight at a very convenient time for me. Also, one carry-on bag is included. Cons: This is the most expensive option at $410, although there is an option for $382 on a website called ""eDreams"" but once again I question the legitimacy.

That caught my eye and really made people who lived in the castle real. The thrones and the beautiful clothing and amazing architecture are all wonderful but being able to really picture the people from that time - working, resting, laughing, struggling, tired, excited, chatting with friends, worried about their kids - I felt all that. 

At the Roman Colosseum, I saw an exhibition of little things found under the seats like buttons, money, etc. It really resonated with me; all those things are found in our stadiums today. 

What are the things that you have seen during your travels that made you feel truly connected to people from the past?",4,0.83,9,2025-04-05 17:47:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1js9539/what_have_you_seen_on_your_travels_that_really/,ForsythCounty

We’ve both been to Rio before so we’ll probably skip Christ the Redeemer and possibly Sugarloaf mountain (unless he really wants to do the helicopter ride) and just chill in Ipanema. He loves a beach vacation. 

We’ve never done Buenos Aires so we want to do 3 full days there, 2 days at the falls, and then 3-4 full days in a Rio. We want to fly Buenos Aires to the Argentinian side of the falls and fly out to Rio from the Brazilian side.

travel,1jpoync,Take the Amtrak or drive to NY?,"Hello, I’d just like a few opinions on if me and my friend should take the train to New York or just drive. We’re roughly 6 hours away by car, the train would take about 13 hours with the stops and layover it has on its route. 

For both of us using the cheapest option for seats, it comes to around $380 since we are taking two connecting trains. I know people say this can be cheaper due to gas and parking expenses, however we are planning on staying in New Jersey and would not be driving into the city, instead taking an Uber or another transportation system. 

Part of me feels like it would be cheaper to drive, but I’ve never been on the Amtrak before and thought it would be a fun idea, but I don’t it to turn into something super expensive. I enjoy driving, but after 3 hours I personally start to get antsy lol. I wanted some opinions on if you were in my situation if you would rather drive or take the train. Thank you for any help!!

EDIT: Thank you all for your suggestions and opinions! I honestly appreciate that a ton of people gave me lots of ideas and things to consider.

I completely forgot to mention in my post, but we are going to see a concert and it estimates on amtrak that we’d get there around 1-2 hours before the concert starts. 

Some people have said there can be delays with the train, so I’m now considering flying instead to not deal with the potential of missing it. If the ride was shorter and I wasn’t needing to be somewhere at a certain time, I’d probably take it, but I don’t want to risk it lol.

Again, I appreciate all the responses and suggestions I didn’t even think about! One day I’ll take the train, but I may this time for the trip lol",3,0.8,50,2025-04-02 13:47:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jpoync/take_the_amtrak_or_drive_to_ny/,livyIabufanda

From what i see safari became extremely expensive and i dont have a lot of savings. Most people are suggesting Botswana or Kenya but from what i've read on reddit people claim that Kenya is a cheaper option. How much can i expect for 5 or 7 day safari to cost. I'm talking cheapest option possible. For 1 person, backpacker. I dont care where i sleep, dont want expensive hotels, all inclusive or anything like that. I just want to travel through wilderness and national parks, see as many animals as possible and check a city or two. Can you point me to some safary agencies, or give me tips and advice for planning the trip, what to see and where to stay. I would like to mention that i have the option to travel with agency, the trip is 13 days and costs about 1700€ + attractions(about 1000€) and includes 1 day of safari. But i prefer to travel alone and organise trip according to my interests.

The trip with agency includes Nairobi, Masai Mara national park and safari, Kibera, Diani Beach, island Wasini, biking throgh Ukunda, Robinson Island, Mombasa.

I am currently in Fairbanks and unfortunately there’s been a nasty snowstorm while I’m here. There’s a chance I may see them tomorrow but either way I’ve been obsessed with the northern lights for a while and know I am going to want to see them again.

I want to stick with North America as I cannot do long flights. I would prefer not to come back to Fairbanks as I like traveling to new places. Willing to come back to Alaska again though.

My ideal trip would be staying in a hotel that has breakfast and food in the lobby/ or walkable to restaurants. Would like to be able to see the lights from outside my hotel or accommodation. 

I have enjoyed sleeping during the day and staying up all night while I’ve been in Alaska and would be fine staying somewhere without many activities. Preferably somewhere that I would not have to rent a car and could easily get to where I’m staying from the airport.

Also an extra would be somewhere that’s on the cheaper side and easy to get to from Denver, Colorado. 

I have read about a few different places in Canada just wanted to see if anyone has personal experience that might match what I’m looking for.

Feel free to comment in the document above. I’d love to hear your suggestions or advice regarding my travel plans! 

I also have a few specific questions that I hope you can help me with:

Iceland's Ring Road self-drive itinerary: ChatGPT suggested skipping the Westfjords and Snæfellsnes Peninsula. Is it really impossible to cover these areas within my timeframe? Also, I’ve heard that apart from Reykjavík, other areas in Iceland are not very developed for tourism, with sparse populations. Would this pose any inconvenience for travelers?

Norway in a Nutshell tickets: I read that buying individual tickets for each segment is much cheaper than purchasing the official tour package. However, some people say that if you book each segment separately and one leg is delayed or disrupted (e.g., due to a strike), it could affect the entire journey. On the other hand, the official package provides assistance in case of disruptions. What’s the best approach here?

Transportation from Bergen to Lofoten: I couldn’t find any direct flights from Bergen to Lofoten. It seems that I have to fly to Bodø first and then take a ferry. How can I check the ferry schedule? I only found various cruise package tours but not standard ferry routes.

Activities in Tromsø: Apart from Northern Lights chasing, what other Arctic experiences would you recommend? (e.g., ice fishing, reindeer experiences, etc.) Are there any recommended tour operators for such activities (like Klook or KKday)?

Additionally, if you have any local recommendations for restaurants and accommodations, please share them with me. I’d really appreciate your help—thank you so much!",3,0.8,24,2025-03-29 15:41:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jmp1tg/iceland_and_norway_itinerary/,tiatsao0727

\- I am not a solo traveller, and this will be my very first solo travel (Singapore-Hanoi for a few days). I am a bit wary but also, I know I can hold my own (23, female, I look like a victim, but I can hold my own in the countries mentioned, they're very safe).

\- I want to choose whichever is cheapest + worth it

\- If Option 1 is significantly cheaper (Bali-Manila-Hanoi) (by around USD 80-100), I'll choose Option 1

\- If Option 2 is significantly cheaper, or only slightly more expensive than Option 1, then I will choose this for the experience. Again, USD 80-100 is the cost difference I can tolerate

I attached the image of the cost comparison, based on the current price of flights right now (+ image attached).

I'm still not entirely sure of the realistic cost of the Speeing Pod, Food, and Activities in Singapore for a layover flight, and Acommodation and Food in Hanoi. I am researching it inmy spare time, but I also want to hear your suggestions!

**What I need help with:**

1. Can you share your experience/cost in either or both Singapore and Hanoi?
2. If you can weigh in on what is the better option based on experience in the same flight/destinations, I would love to hear your thoughts!
3. What was your experience solo travelling?

I am the type of traveler that most hate. I love photography, so I take photos a lot, it is the highlight of my trip for me because I can enjoy it after the trip pa hehe. I love wearing cute clothes, but I am willing to bring less/maneuver the luggage situation, so I only bring 7kg for Option 2. I want to stay longer in one place to appreciate it and explore every nook and cranny than going everywhere. I am less of a traveler and more of a vacationer, so I might not enjoy Singapore if I'm exhausted but it's Singapore, so I think I'll enjoy even if I stay in the airport and only leave for the city center for dinner.

Please be kind, even if you don't agree with my travelling style. I just wanted to hear the thoughts of veteran travellers/those who have done the same trip as the one I'm planning. Thank you.

If I missed any details, please ask. I will kindly provide more context, I just think my post is already too long.

travel,1jmanpd,Antigua or Mexico city in May? Open to other suggestions,"Hi all,

Looking to take my girlfriend of three years on an international trip in late May, as she hadn’t been out of the country a ton. I travel a lot for work so unfortunately my windows of availability to leisure travel are the best.

I’ve been to Latina America, Asia and am very comfortable in foreign countries, but want to choose not too adventurous of a place to ease her into things. That said, two places I’m looking at are Mexico City and Antigua. Both are tourist friendly and have direct flights from LAX, which is a huge plus as well probably only have 4-5 nights. We are the type of people who can have a blast doing both city and nature things, so both are very appealing. 

Downside is that May is the beginning of rainy season and I’m wondering which of these is better, or if it wouldn’t be worth it.

travel,1jlm9rm,August 10 day road trip through the Balkans- help me choose route!?,"
Hi y’all, I have 10 days in the Balkans, and my husband and I are renting a car. We love moving around, seeing different landscapes, and don’t mind a packed itinerary. I really want to experience the mountains and alpine scenery, but I also want to get down to the southern coast of Albania. My husband, on the other hand, is set on seeing some of Croatia.

We know that renting a car in Croatia and dropping it off in Albania can be tricky, but we’re open to working around it. Here are two rough route ideas—would love your thoughts on how to divide our time or if you have a better suggestion!

Route 1: Just Albania
	•	Tiranë
	•	Shkodër
	•	Theth (Albanian Alps)
	•	Albanian Riviera (Vlore or Himarë?)
	•	Maybe a ferry to Corfu
	•	Back to Tiranë to fly home

Route 2: Croatia to Albania
	•	Dubrovnik
	•	Kotor (Montenegro)
	•	Shkodër
-would LOVE to fit a teth ntl park in here if possible 
	•	Vlore
	•	Tiranë to fly home

I love the idea of seeing the transitions between different countries, but I’m struggling to balance beach vs. mountain time. How many days would you recommend in each place? And is one of these routes a clear winner?

Would love any advice or alternatives! Thanks!",3,1.0,7,2025-03-28 03:47:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jlm9rm/august_10_day_road_trip_through_the_balkans_help/,Automatic_Intern_440

travel,1jkriru,Seeking Advice from locals and experienced travellers for my World Trip,"Cheers, everyone ;)

Please excuse grammatical errors or spelling mistakes; it's not my native language. c:

Here's some info about me so you can get a better image of what I might know or don't know.

I'm a m/20 from austria. German as a native language and English on a C1 level (I'm better at speaking than typing). I already had the privilege to visit many different countries with my family, resorts, and hotels, so mostly crowded beaches and cities. As an introvert, I feel much better discovering cozy rural towns, finding secret beaches, or experiencing beautiful natural scenery.

The countries outside of Europe I have visited so far are:

* Turkey | Antalya
* Egypt | Hurghada
* Maledives | Olhuveli Island
* Thailand | Phuket, Patong Beach

I always wanted to travel the world, and now after I graduated high school and served my mandatory military service, I'll finally be able to fulfill my dream of traveling Asia by car for roughly 5.5 months (24 weeks).

I will start from Austria and drive all the way to Turkey in the first couple of days without much of a stop. After Turkey, Georgia, and finally Azerbaijan, I'm going to take a ferry at Baku over the Caspian Sea to whatever port in Kazakhstan. My research got me to the point that there are regularly ferries that transfer from the Caspian Sea to ports in Kazakhstan. The tickets for the ferry can be bought locally at the port, to my knowledge. After I arrive in Kazakhstan, I'll finally start with the main part of my journey. The car I use for traveling is an old VW bus and is already edited for traveling. There's a bed in it as well as a little kitchen and an external shower. Electricity is also being produced by solar panels on top of the car. I am just going to travel from town to town and decide on the go what I would like to see today. The entire way from Austria to Baku, Azerbaijan, is not supposed to be any longer than 1 week. In Kazakhstan I will roughly spend 2 weeks.

The next country would be Kyrgyzstan, which was one of the reasons I wanted to do this journey so badly. I have heard nothing but positive things about this country, its nature, its people, and its food. I'm maybe going to spend 2 weeks there.

Next stop, PR China. Sadly, it is not possible to drive in China with an Austrian (EU) driver's license without any additional burdens. Even with an international driver's license (which I possess), it is not possible to drive in China without the Tourist Driver's Allowance. It can be obtained by a multiple-choice test regarding Chinese traffic signs and an ophthalmologist's certificate. Since I will enter PR China in the middle of the desert, I wanted to ask how the hell I'm supposed to get to a doctor who can hand me such a certificate and where to do that test. I really have not found a good solution for this problem so far, so I would appreciate any help or correction if I got anything wrong. If I find a solution regarding this problem, I would spend 1 week in China until I enter Mongolia.

Mongolia, also a country I wanted to travel to very desperately. I will roughly spend 2 weeks in Mongolia.

I'm going to enter the PR China again at this border control: [https://maps.app.goo.gl/NhXnLnneP4qrhQjg6](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NhXnLnneP4qrhQjg6)

I will continue to drive eastwards to Peking, then Tianjin, and after that I will stay at the coast all the way south till I enter Vietnam. I'm probably going to stay a little bit in Shanghai and Peking, but as I already mentioned earlier. I prefer nature over cities, so maybe I will find some pretty places along the way. Estimation for PR China is 4 weeks.

I'm putting together Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand here since I am probably going to cross the border a couple of times probably until I enter PR China north of Thailand again. Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand will also roughly take 2 weeks.

Thailand will be just a brief visit since I have already visited it, and it simply is a target for a later journey.

Bhutan and Nepal both together will take 3 weeks since I would like to take some time for myself in the NP Annapurna.

India is the next big country I'm going to spend a lot of time in. Mostly at the north side close to the Himalayas. 3-4 weeks is what I'm supposed to spend in India until I re-enter PR China and make myself back on the way home. From entering the PR-China, I'm going back on the route from Kaxgar to Almaty. From there, all the way across Kazakhstan to the port, I arrived and back with a ferry to Baku. From there, the same home I arrived in in the first place. From India until home, I estimated 3 weeks.

After arriving in Austria, I will continue my journey westwards to Gibraltar, where I will park my bus and hitchhike a sailboat. In online forums, I have heard of a concept called hand against cot (""Hand gegen Kojüte"" in German). Hopefully I will find a ship pretty soon there that's crossing the Atlantic at a cheap price or, at best, for free. After arriving wherever in the Caribbean, I'm going to take a flight to Buenos Aires, where there are ""frequent flights"" to Río Gallegos in the south of Argentina. There I would buy a used/cheap motorcycle and travel from South America to North America for another 5.5 months (24 weeks). I would sleep in a tent and live off daily groceries like noodles or local food. I'm not going to lean into singular countries regarding a route or time estimations since I believe I can decide pretty much on the way what I would like to see in what time. But rough estimations are

South America—2.5 Months (11 Weeks)

* Brazil 2 Weeks
* Argentina 3 Weeks
* Bolivia + Chile 3 Weeks
* Peru + Colombia 3 Weeks

North America—3 Months (13 Weeks)

* Panama + Costa Rica + Nicaragua + Honduras + Guatemala 2 Weeks
* Mexico 3 Weeks
* USA 4 Weeks
* Canada 4 Weeks

I'm also not quite sure on how to get from South America to North America in the cheapest way possible.

My overall budget for the gas, food, water, etc., so basically for the entire journey, will be €17,000 (the bus is already paid, so it's just the motorcycle).

Thanks for reading this very, very long and detailed plan of my world trip. If there are any missing information in this text, route optimizations, tips for beautiful secret places the tourists don't know about, or even just a comment regarding this idea as a whole. I appreciate it. ;)

travel,1jkahw2,Chinese student travel LAX → DUB → AMS transfer issues in Dublin?,"Hello, 

I have an issue and having a hard time getting a solution. 

We're a group of students, including a Chinese student, travelling home with this itinerary with Aer Lingus:

LAX →DUB  
21 May 20:15 - 14:30 (+1 day)  
  
DUB → AMS   
22 May 18:20 - 20:55

We all bought our tickets together, and she got her visa for US but now this transfer in Dublin is confusing us. It says:

""If both your arrival flight and onward connecting flight are in Terminal 2 between the hours of 04:00 and 16:00 on the same day, you can use a transit visa in this case."" 

China is not on the list of of countries that needs this, but the connecting flight is after the 04:00-16:00. Can she go through to the gate already or will there be issues? 

If she gets an earlier flight before 16:00 to Copenhagen and then to Amsterdam, would it be okay or will she be stopped in Los Angeles? 

We need to know if she has to book another flight, which would also be much more expensive and she doesn't have that kind of money. Any help or guidance is greatly appreciated!

We wrote the airport who said we should contact the embassy and we also got through the airline telephone after trying for many hours, and he said we should also check with the embassy but that it should be fine (?).

Thank you!!!

Looking for a spot to host my bachelor party for guys between 30 - 33. Not looking for Vegas or anything like that. I’ve narrowed down to a few places but I’ve never been to any of them so I am unsure if they would be a good spot. 

Quick details:
Time frame: July - August
Amount of people: ~12 - 15
Should have direct flights from Chicago, under $500 round trip (rules out Jackson Hole Wyoming and Aspen and Bend, Oregon) 
Should be within 1 hour or less of airport.

- Hike with nice views
- White water raft
- Hit up some breweries
- One nice dinner in town
- Poker night at the house, so ideally it should be a house large enough for 12 to 15 guys that has a backyard for a bonfire or fairly secluded. 

Bonus points if there’s a river to do a chill float down with some beers and also if there’s a nice central town area. Similar to Bend Oregon, which I loved when I visited but there are no direct flights from Chicago.

- Big Sky, Montana
- Bozeman, Montana
- Missoula, Montana
- Boulder, Colorado
- Asheville, North Carolina

travel,1k4twnc,Traveling with family for oktoberfest suggestions,"Hey all, I'm trying to plan a trip to Germany this year for oktoberfest and have barely any clue on how logistics normally work. I did a 2 week stay in Australia last year, but that was arranged by a local friend who acted as a guide. I'm wondering what is all involved in getting there and having the ability to travel freely. I have 4 people including myself currently lined up for it. 

Is it much effort to get a rental car for travel to nearby areas? I see my license is valid for 90 days and visas aren't really a thing for short stays. I need to get dates lined up for flights but past that, is there a good recommendation for lodging? I want to take my parents because they always described it as a beautiful place, and I wish to experience it as well. What do you think a 4 person trip will run me? Not really an issue but wanting to know ahead of time. I'm currently kind of sleep deprived so this post may be a bit everywhere, but any help would be appreciated. Thanks

Most travel sites / forums only address *part* of what I'm looking for so aim hoping you travel geniuses can help me out:

- Caribbean / Mexico / East Coast  
- AMAZING beach
- Upscale but not bonkers luxury resort (<$800/night) 
- NOT all inclusive if possible 
- Vegan friendly (either on site or local cuisine). And I mean actual food not just ""fruit bowl for breakfast and single sad pasta dish in the cafe that you need to request they omit cheese"" 
- Awesome kids club with good supervision / safety
- SAFE area, would like to explore without having to stay in a tourist zone


Yes, I understand that the Caribbean in July/August isn't ideal weather wise but I'm willing to take our chances, but will consider an equally good east coast resort that doesn't cost a bajillion dollars. 


I have a travel agent that recommended Half Moon in Jamaica which fits most of these except the safety part. I hear good things about Aruba as well.

2. On-site dining: We would like to walk to meals and stay on campus for all food.   
3. Fun activities for a 3 year old: We would like lots of activities for a 3 year old on campus. Disney or other resorts do not seem like a good fit because they are more oriented to older kids. He will not be able to do big kid rides.

Pax: 2 (me and my wife)
Arrival & exit: Milan (28th May)- Rome (8th June)
Accommodation: Mix of Hotels and Airbnb

Verona 
28th-29th-30th-31st (4 nights)

I am making Verona as my base to explore. We want to visit all beautiful sights of Verona, enjoy food experience and simply soak in the north Italian charm.
Day trips we wish to do from Verona: Lake Garda, Padua
Day-1: Verona
Day-2: Lake Garda, Sirmione (Brescia it time permits)
Day-3: Padua, Vicenza
Day-4: Trento (or at leisure in Verona)

Florence 
1st-2nd-3rd June (3 nights)

We want to enjoy Florence, but reading it to be tourist trap and expensive theme park; I’m unsure where to stay. Does it make sense to stay in Florence? Or we could base ourselves somewhere on outskirts?
Day-1: Florence
Day-2: Florence
Day-3: Pisa-Lucca-Florence

Pienza/Montepulciano/Grosseto/Sienna: 
4th-5th June (2 nights)

Will do one/two of above places. Undecided where to stay. But the region is so beautiful, I don’t want to miss it

Rome: 
6th-7th-8th

I think Rome will easily take 3 days to explore. We will add a day trip is possible to explore something around. Open to suggestions.

I really wish to do Naples with day trip to somewhere Sorrento/Ischia. But it looks very difficult unless I sacrifice day in Verona/Tuscany.

How does this look? Is it doable? Both of us are 36, and decently fit. Any suggestions on where to stay or some experience/food/tour that you highly recommend?

travel,1k3yuo1,11 Day Peru Itinerary Advice,"Hey everyone! My wife and I are headed to Peru for an 11 day trip and would love some feedback/suggestions. We’re flying into Lima late on the first day and staying in the airport hotel. Then heading to Cusco early on Day 2. We want to see Machu Picchu, Sacred Valley, Cusco, and possibly Lake Humantay and Rainbow Mountain. We had originally thought to see another region in Peru as well but after some research it seems like this could cause us to be too rushed. We want to see a lot but dont want to constantly be on the move. 



Itinerary:

\* Day 1 – Arrive in Lima. Stay at airport hotel

\* Day 2 – Fly to Cusco (early AM), chill, explore, acclimate

\* Day 3 – Cusco day – explore San Blas, Qorikancha. Take it easy to continue acclimating. 

\* Day 4 – Sacred Valley day trip: Pisac, Ollantaytambo, Moray, Maras

\* Would it make more sense to stay in Ollantaytambo this night or head straight to Aguas Calientes?

\* Day 5–6/7 – Machu Picchu (ideally a 2-day, 1-night or 3-day, 2-night tour)

\* Having trouble picking a tour of Machu Pichu. It seems like there at 4D/3N and 2D/1N tours ( we’d love a 3D/2N lol). But confused as to how to get a mix of hiking + train which both seem really cool and unique. 

\* Day 7 – Return to Cusco

\* Day 8 – Day trip to Lake Humantay/Rainbow Mountain

\* Day 9 – Day trip to Lake Humantay/Rainbow Mountain 

\* Day 10 – Final full day in Cusco 

\* Day 11 – Fly from Cusco to Lima → fly home late that night



Questions:

\* Does this itinerary feel too rushed or too drawn out? Are we allowing enough rest and acclimation time? I'm especially concerned about the two day trips in a row. 

\* Anything I’,m completely missing?

\* Tour company recs?

\* I had a thought to stay in sacred valley but having trouble figuring out logistics as most tours seem to leave from Cusco. 

\- would another Peru region make sense or should we stick to this area?

\- Any hotel or general recs are appreciated!!

  
Thank You!!

My current passport expires in July 2025, and I’ve started researching the renewal process. From what I understand, whether you do it online or by mail, you have to send in your old passport and wait for the new one, which is tricky for me.

I fly to Canada for business 1–2 times a month, and I don’t have Global Entry or Nexus (yet). Even with expedited processing, I’m nervous about being without my passport for more than 2 weeks, especially if something unexpected delays the process. That’s a big risk for me work-wise.

Ideally, I’m looking for a way to renew while holding on to my current passport or minimizing the time I’m without it. I’m totally open to other ideas too, like getting Global Entry if that could help in any way, or going to a passport agency in person if that would be faster.

travel,1k2bwck,"Help us pick our last US trip together: PNW, Yellowstone, or Florida?","Hi everyone!

My friend and I are planning a one-week trip in mid-May and trying to choose between three very different travel options in the US. Each has its own appeal, but we’re having trouble deciding what would make for the most memorable and enjoyable experience—especially since this might be our last big trip together before she moves abroad.

Here are the options we’re considering:

Seattle + Portland (PNW) – We’re drawn to the vibe, food scene, nearby nature, and walkable neighborhoods. We’re not planning any hardcore hikes—just want to soak in the city energy, maybe visit some parks, and enjoy the coastal atmosphere.

Yellowstone and nearby areas – We’d have to join a tour since we don’t drive. It seems like a once-in-a-lifetime kind of place, but we’re unsure if May is a good time to visit, or if a group tour would feel rushed or exhausting.

Florida (Orlando + Miami) – The mix of theme parks and beaches is tempting, but we’re worried it might be too crowded or touristy in May. That said, it could also be a super fun and carefree choice.

A few notes about us:

We won’t be renting a car, so accessibility via public transport or tours is a big factor.
We like city exploring, scenic views, cultural spots, and some time in nature—but nothing too physically demanding.

Ideally, we’re hoping for something meaningful and low-stress, with minimal logistics to worry about.

Would love to hear your thoughts or experiences with any of these options—especially if you've done them without a car. Thanks in advance!

Update:
Just wanna add another option: San Francisco + Yosemite/or somewhere near SF

We are not considering driving since my friend was in a car accident a while ago and still feels uneasy about driving, and I don’t feel confident driving long distances in unfamiliar places either😢",1,0.51,114,2025-04-18 18:24:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k2bwck/help_us_pick_our_last_us_trip_together_pnw/,Shoddy-Wait-5886

I've been to London a bunch and would like to go somewhere I've not been.

The two options I'm looking at, one gets into Rome at 2200 on a Friday, and I'd fly out at 1310 Saturday. The other gets into Dublin at 1635 Saturday and I'd fly out 0930 Sunday.

So the Rome flight gets in late but also gives me time the next morning; the Dublin flight gets in earlier but is a pretty early flight out, and I'm kinda leaning away from that for that reason. Never having been to Rome, and only spending one day in Dublin decades ago, I'm not sure which airport is easier to get to/from the city center, nor what the cities are like either on a Saturday morning (Rome) or a Saturday night (Dublin). Can anyone provide some input about transit experiences in those cities?

If it helps in terms of policies, the airline would either be American or BA.

travel,1k1cjqz,France & Amsterdam itinerary too packed? Open to tips,"Hey everyone, I’ll be traveling from Singapore to France and Amsterdam this coming late April to early May. We love food, chill scenic walks, and cute cafés. Not big into museums or nightlife.

We’ll be spending time in Paris, Strasbourg, Lyon, Nice, and ending in Amsterdam. Accoms and trains are mostly booked, so now I’m just checking if this is realistic — or if it’s one of those trips that looks good on paper but ends up too exhausting in practice 😅 

**Paris > Strasbourg > Lyon > Nice > Amsterdam** 

**📍Paris (2 nights)**

* Arriving from CDG, staying near Gare de l’Est
* Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, bakery hopping (La Maison Rose, Du Pain et des Idées, Carette)
* Walking Champs-Élysées, grabbing dinner near Saint-Émilion
* Not doing Louvre or Versailles — keeping it scenic and food-focused

**📍Strasbourg (3 nights)**

* Day trip to Colmar (return by train)
* Petite France, Place Kléber, local winstubs, cathedral
* Trying local bakeries and chill walks around the riverside
* Staying near the station

**📍Lyon (3 nights)**

* Bouchon dinner (Les Lyonnais), and another at Carmelo
* May do the 2-hour e-bike tour if the weather’s nice
* Exploring Vieux Lyon, traboules, Parc de la Tête d’Or, and checking out Presqu’île
* Staying fairly central

**📍Nice (3 nights)**

* Promenade des Anglais, flower market, beach strolls
* One day trip to Eze, plus a walk up to the Jardin Exotique
* Food will be light and local — socca, seafood, pastries

**📍Amsterdam (4 nights)**

* Exploring the city by tram and foot
* Anne Frank House, Keukenhof, and a half-day out to Zaandam + Zaanse Schans
* Cafés like Lanskroon, Fabel Friet, Winkel 43

  
Is this too packed or stressful? Any days that feel unrealistic or too rushed?

Here’s the itinerary for reference:

* ✈️ Return Air Tickets Included
* 🌆 6 Nights in Tashkent
* 🌃 4-Star International Standard Hotels

Looking forward to your suggestions! TIA.

EDIT: Thanks so much, everyone, for the clarity! I have a lot more information now to make a wise decision.

travel,1k0jd6v,Help me choose - Tanzania (2 options),"Hi all, I'm in the midst of planning a bucket list vacation for my husband and I to Tanzania in November 2026, combining time spent on safari with time spent relaxing on the beach in Zanzibar. I've narrowed down to two itineraries/quotes and am having trouble deciding between the two. They have many similarities - length of time, route, private guide/car the entire time on safari.  
  
Would love your takes and/or first-hand reviews of either operator or any of the accommodations. I'm particularly wondering if quote 1 is too good to be true?!

**Option 1 - Operator is Easy Travel Tanzania**

*Total Price:* $20,652 CAD

*Accommodations*: Lemala Ngorongoro Tented Camp, Lemala Nanyukie, Zuri Zanzibar 

*Pros*: LOVE all of the accommodations provided. Company seems to have very positive reviews online, is a member of TATO. Cheaper option.

*Cons*: Slightly less professional communications compared to other operator. Quote was a bit less clear - providing us with total price per person for the safari portion but then providing individual nightly cost for the Zanzibar portion. Also quoting based on 2025 rates, noting that the lodges haven't yet released 2026 but we can hold at 2025 rates for now and pay the difference later. Is this normal? 

*Other notes:* Local company based in Tanzania and specialized focus on this nation.  


**Option 2 - Operator is Vaya Adventures** 

*Total Price:* $24,575 CAD  
*Accommodations*: Lemala Ngorongoro Tented Camp, Serengeti Acacia Bliss, Zuri Zanzibar 

*Pros*: Still very much into all accommodations provided, only difference between the two itineraries is the Serengeti location. Company seems to have very positive reviews online. Communication has been impeccable, very clear and professional information sharing. 

*Cons*: More expensive, don't like the Serengeti location as much as the Lamala Nanyukie in option 1. 

*Other notes:* Not local to Tanzania but work with local operators/guides. Company does not solely specialize in safari/Tanzania although this is a main focus area. They seem to offer luxury travel primarily in Africa & South America. Does include more note of stops throughout the trip and guided visits to villages, Stone Town while in Zanzibar etc.",2,1.0,21,2025-04-16 12:37:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k0jd6v/help_me_choose_tanzania_2_options/,mmeast

We are going to be in Germany the week before so we are taking the train from Munich to Zurich on 5/30. First time visitors and open to anything - a bit of hikes (not too intensive though). Looking for advice or any additional recs for the following rough itinerary - thank you!

Travel wise, planning to look on the SBB app - looks like it might be better for us to the saver day pass and half fare card instead of the Swiss Travel Pass.

5/30 Zurich 

* Arrive in early afternoon
* Explore western old town, Lindenhof, walk around the lake 
* Lindt chocolate museum 
* Kunsthaus Zürich

5/31 - 6/3 Lauterbrunnen - Grindelwald - Lake Brienz (with Wengen as base)

Avoiding Interlaken as base after reading through reviews (though yes it is convenient as a travel hub) 

5/31 Lauterbrunnen

* Hike in the valley and visit the Trümmelbach Falls, Staubbach Falls, Weisse Lutschine, take the cable car up to Murren
* If time allows, go up to Schilthorn as well 

6/1 Grindelwald

* Mannlichen Royal Walk
* Mannlichen to Kleine Scheidegg hike
* Grindelwald First 
* Anything else we should do?

6/2 Lake Brienz

* Giessbach Falls 
* Brienzer Rothorn - Cogweel train for the scenic ride
* Gelmerbahn
* Harder Kulm back in Interlaken
* Debated between Lake Brienz or Lake Oeschinensee but Lake Brienz is more convenient. Half of us are leaving that day so figured Lake Brienz is better. Appreciate any advice here! 

6/3 Lucerne

* Explore old town, museums and take a boat tour

6/4 Lucerne

* Lake Lucerne to Vitznau via boat, then cogwheel train up to Rigi, and cable car down 

6/5 Bern

6/6 Geneva (day trip to Montreux)

* Prefer checking out Montruex vs. staying in Geneva 
* Lavaux Vineyard, Lake Geneva

6/7 Geneva to NYC

travel,1jzg9la,Sardinia vs Albanian Riviera: which one to choose for an 12-day trip in June,"In early June I'll travel with my parents to Italy (14 days) and we'll end the trip in Sardinia (4 days). We'll flight to Cagliari, drive to Villasimius and sleep there. In the next day we'll drive to Santa Maria Navarrese or Cala Gonone and stay in the nearest beaches. Then, we'll do a boat trip through Orosei Gulf (I'm thinking about doing a hike to a secluded beach like Cala Goloritzé, meet the boat there and continue the day with them). They still need to buy the flight back to Rome to leave Italy so the last day depends on that (ie if we have to go to Olbia then we need to plan for an itinerary that we'll be different than if they flight back from Alghero or Cagliari).

I'll be in Europe for 12 extra days and during 5 of those days I'll have to work remotely, starting at 2pm - which means that I have the mornings to explore. I'm very doubtful if I stay in Sardine or if I visit somewhere else like Albanian Riviera.

In Sardinia, I'd visit other beaches in the Orosei like Cala Luna, Cala Sisine, Cala Mariolu and some other hikes like Pedra Longa trail and Passo Ghenna Silana → Gorropu Canyon. I could continue going North and although I haven't researched much, everyone says it's even prettier than Gulf of Orosei, which I already found absolutely astonishing from the pictures I saw.

In Albania Riviera, I'd most likely stay in Himarë. Using it as a base, I could explore the nearby beaches: Filikuri, Jale, Qeparo, Celestina, Livadhi, Aquarium, Gjipe, etc. Hike to Porto Palermo, Himara Castle, etc. Could also visit Gjirokastër for a day trip or even stay a couple days. I could even go south at the end of my trip, get a boat to Corfu, stay one or two days there and flight back to Milan.

In a nutshell, Sardinia seems more beautiful and more expensive. Albanian Riviera overall costs are appealing to me even if the nature is not in the same league as Sardinia's. I'm very curious to taste Albanian food and I think I'll get bored with Italian food. Sardinia's hikes look more challenging, which means I'd need my hiking boots - which sounds like downside if I want to travel light.

Please, help me decide! Are my assumptions correct? Am there any aspects I'm not considering?",2,1.0,3,2025-04-15 01:56:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jzg9la/sardinia_vs_albanian_riviera_which_one_to_choose/,MuriloScarpa

I'd be in multiple cities/countries and might not buy the return leg flight on the same airline as I would be in a different city upon making the return leg. 

  
What are some good travel insurance options for this kind of situation? Do people just use the trip insurance offered by airlines at checkout? If I want to cancel or reschedule, I guess it might not be a ""covered cancellation"" option as I don't think ""this trip doesn't fit my schedule"" counts as a covered reason. 

  
Also- what are some options for insurance for things like flight cancellations or delays?  I never really bought insurance in the past, as I was young and just bought the cheapest tickets and if something didn't work out, just toughed it out. But have had some crazy experiences in the past that I'd like to hedge against now.

travel,1jyl96n,France itinerary in november,"I'm going to France next November and would like opinions on this itinerary. I have 20 days. I've been to Paris once, so this time I want to focus more on the countryside (but still going to Paris cause my husband hasn't been there and we're visiting a friend). Nice in November might seem weird, but I've researched and it seems doable, I don't necessarily have to go swimming, just want to see the sights. I won't have a car, want to get around by train, preferably.

Paris (5 days)

Avignon (3 days) 
Will take day trips to other towns in Provence during the stay, could also stay in Aix but decided for Avignon cause it's more central

Nice (4 days)
Day trips to Cannes, Monaco, maybe Saint Tropez

Lyon (4 days)
Would love suggestions for cool day trips 

Strasbourg (3 days)
Day trip to Colmar

And from Strasbourg, I'll go back to Paris for my return flight.

Any suggestions? Are these good places to go in November, and are the time spans appropriate for each?

travel,1jyjsdm,Menorca or Costa Brava (or Costa del Sol)?,"Hello! My wife and I are trying to decide on a place to stay in Spain in the second half of May. We are looking for a good beach spot specifically. Last year we were on the Greek island of MIlos for the seaside part of our trip, where we were spoiled for beaches. We would like to stay somewhere similar in terms of quality of beaches and water.

This year we are trying to decide between Costa Brava or Menorca. Costa de Sol is also a consideration, but seems underwhelming compared to the other two locations. But, if you have it, we would love to hear evidence to the contrary. 

So for us the major things to consider are: temperature (both daily and water temps in late May), quality of beaches and surrounding landscapes, and a relaxed and local feel to the place we’ll stay. Food is also very important, and the possibility of nice hikes and walks are very welcome.

We will be there for about eight days in the second half of May. If we go with Costa Brava, with its higher latitude, would the water feel much colder than Menorca, enough to prevent us from considering it? Aside from the beaches, it seems that Costa Brava has a host of wonderful small towns from which to choose. While Menorca offers more beaches, and more of a getaway from everything.

My wife and I are both fluent in Spanish, so language will not be an issue, if it helps to know.Thanks in advance!!",2,1.0,1,2025-04-13 22:25:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jyjsdm/menorca_or_costa_brava_or_costa_del_sol/,RhyzomeElPaisano

we are making a 35 days road trip in central Europe this summer. In Austria we will see Vienna (4 nights) , Graz (2 nights) , and Wachau Valley (2 nights in Krems). We have 5 others nights. For now we have 2 nights near Zell am See and 3 nights in Bad Aussee. We already neem to Salzburg in another trip 

After done some reading it seems that:  
1) Zell Am See could be skipped  
2) Bad Aussee is not a good base for Salzkagermmut

We have chose Zell Am See mainly because we would like to do the Grossglockner road. The thing is that that road have to been on a clear sky day to be enjoyable. 

What would you do with those 5 nights Between Graz and Wachau Valley (Vienna will be the start of our 35 days trip) ?

travel,1jwmarx,2 weeks in Yucatan: my itinerary!,"Hi, in a week i'm travelling to Mexico for 3 weeks. The first week we are going to spend in CDMX, we already have a good itinerary (suggestions always welcome!).

After CDMX we're taking the plane to Yucatan. I have created a itinerary for travelling around Yucatan in 2 weeks. We are going to rent a car, so transportation is no issue.

Below my summary, suggestions/tips & tricks are welcome!

  
**Day 1 --> 3 (3 nights) : Isla Mujeres**

* We want to start off with a couple of days on the beach and really take our rest. Hoblox was our first choice but ultimately decided on Mujeres because it's close to the airport and no immediate need for a rental car/taking a bus.

**Day 4 --> 6 (3 nights) : Valladolid**

* Visiting the town
* Ek Balam
* Cenotes (like Chichikan/ Xchanche

**Day 7 --> 10 (4 nights): Merida**

* First day: from Valladolid to Merida: do Chichen Itza on our way. If we have time also Izamal in the late afternoob
* Visiting the city
* Progresso, (my girlfriend loves raccoons and wants to visit Reserva Ecológica El Corchito
* Cenotes at Homun (Cenote Santa Bárbara)
* Celestun maybe, but Flamingos are already gone??

**Day 10 --> 12 (3 nights): Bacalar**

* First day: from Merida to Uxmal, afternoon a 5hr drive to Bacalar
* Spend time at the lagoon
* Boat tour at Canal de los Piratas
* Rapidos not really worth it?

**Day 12 --> 14 (3 nights): Coba/Tulum**

* Found a hotel between Coba and Tulum which is so much cheaper than a hotel right in Tulum
* Coba ruins
* Snorkeling at Akumal
* Cenotes/beach days",2,1.0,4,2025-04-11 10:07:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jwmarx/2_weeks_in_yucatan_my_itinerary/,Laulaufuego
travel,1jw4ryt,Trip across the south of France starting in Nice and ending in Toulouse,"Hello everyone,

I’m currently planning a week long trip in May with my girlfriend. We both need to back in Toulouse by the 25th so ideally we go back on the 24th. 

Our current plan is to spend time in Nice exploring the city with possible day trips to Cannes and Antibes. Then travel back to Toulouse via Marseille and Montpellier, spending a couple of nights here, to see the flamingos. 

Here is rough itinerary 
Nice - 4 days, 3 nights
Marseille - 2 days, 1 night
Montpellier - 3 days, 2 nights
Toulouse - 1 night then fly

Now the question is do we try to maximise our time in Nice/Montpellier or stop off in Marseille to break up the travelling. We are trying to enjoy the food, wine and beaches but would like to try to go on a hike and experience interesting cultural activities (museums, monuments, etc.). Nightlife in terms of wine bars and cocktails would suffice, we don’t need to go clubbing.

What’s your opinion on the vibes of Montpellier and Marseille?
