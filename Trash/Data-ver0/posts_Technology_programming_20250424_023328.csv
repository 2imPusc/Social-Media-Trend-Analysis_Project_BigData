programming,1k5m8pr,"Comprehensibility and ""Perceived"" Correctness Is All You Need","In this recent ICSE work, we explored how software developers define and evaluate the trustworthiness of an AI-generated code suggestion and what the reasons are that they may change their minds later about their decision. The result shows that they only consider comprehensibility and correctness as their factors for trust and don't (or couldn't due to lack of tools) assess for safety and maintainability of the code. We also found that developers can't assess the correctness of the code correctly; therefore, there's a gap between the perceived correctness and the actual correctness, which makes them alter their trust in already trusted AI code generation.

Next-generation AI code assistants can be over-trusted, and we should think of tools that can help programmers make more informed decisions when trusting AI-generated code.",0,0.29,11,2025-04-23 00:38:10,https://www.amazon.science/publications/trust-dynamics-in-ai-assisted-development-definitions-factors-and-implications,sadrasabouri

programming,1k3q0st,Swarm Debugging with MCP,"Everyone’s looking at MCP as a way to connect LLMs to tools.

What about connecting LLMs to other LLM agents?

I built Deebo, the first ever agent MCP server. Your coding agent can start a session with Deebo through MCP when it runs into a tricky bug, allowing it to offload tasks and work on something else while Deebo figures it out asynchronously.

Deebo works by spawning multiple subprocesses, each testing a different fix idea in its own Git branch. It uses any LLM to reason through the bug and returns logs, proposed fixes, and detailed explanations. The whole system runs on natural process isolation with zero shared state or concurrency management. Look through the code yourself, it’s super simple.

If you’re on Cline or Claude Desktop, installation is as simple as npx deebo-setup@latest.

[Here’s the repo. Take a look at the code!](https://github.com/snagasuri/deebo-prototype)

[Here’s a demo video of Deebo in action on a real codebase.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/141VdQ9DNOfnOpP_mmB0UPMr8cwAGrxKC/view?usp=sharing)

Deebo scales to real codebases too. Here, it launched 17 scenarios and [diagnosed a $100 bug bounty issue in Tinygrad.](https://github.com/snagasuri/deebo-prototype/blob/master/memory-bank/9bd38e9840d3/progress.md)

programming,1k4c7g8,A multi-language codebase with symbolic abstractions — would love feedback from systems thinkers,"**I've been building a complex system that blends multiple languages (Python, Ruby, TypeScript/React) to explore how software can model not just logic but layered meaning. It's not your typical CRUD stack — this project uses a dialectic structure where each knowledge entry has a main point, a counterpoint, and a counterfactual. There's also a custom lexical network (think a dynamic ontology of stems and familiar terms) and experimental logic layers inspired by mathematical structures.**

I've just published a deep-dive comparing this approach to conventional best practices — especially Stanford-style architecture, modularity, naming, and testability. I’m not rejecting best practices — I value it  — but this system takes a more experimental, recursive approach and I’d love critical, thoughtful feedback from devs who think about structure, semantics, and system design.

If this sounds interesting, the article is here: [The Longer Version](https://seriace.substack.com/p/analysis-of-seriaces-symbolic-scroll)

I know the system might seem overengineered or even eccentric, but it wasn’t built to be clever — it was built to model relationships between ideas in ways that flat logic sometimes misses. That said, I’m still looking for collaborators who can help refine it, simplify parts, and connect it back to more standard tooling. If you’ve worked on DSLs, symbolic reasoning, recursive data, or you’re just into bending the usual paradigms — would love your take.

(And yeah, I know some naming conventions are… unconventional. Open to ideas.)

programming,1jwegdm,How To Solve The Dual Write Problem in Distributed Systems?,"# Understanding the Dual Write Problem

In a microservice architecture, services often need to update their database and communicate state changes to other services via events. This leads to the **dual write problem**: performing two separate writes (one to the database, one to the message broker) without atomic guarantees. If either operation fails, the system becomes inconsistent.

For example, imagine a payment service that processes a money transfer via a REST API. After saving the transaction to its database, it must emit a *TransferCompleted* event to notify the credit service to update a customer’s credit offer.

If the database write succeeds but the event publish fails (or vice versa), the two services fall out of sync. The payment service thinks the transfer occurred, but the credit service never updates the offer.

This article’ll explore strategies to solve the dual write problem, including the **Transactional Outbox, Event Sourcing, and Listen-to-Yourself.**

For each solution, we’ll analyze how it works (with diagrams), its advantages, and disadvantages. There’s no one-size-fits-all answer — each approach involves trade-offs in consistency, complexity, and performance.

By the end, you’ll understand how to choose the right solution for your system’s requirements.",0,0.42,8,2025-04-11 01:37:32,https://medium.com/@lucas.rj.fernandes/1744cb7b08ae,Nervous-Staff3364

programming,1jlygi7,"Rust-like Result<T, E> for TypeScript? Check out rustify!","Hey devs,

Made a small library, rustify, bringing Rust's Result<T, E> (Ok/Err) pattern to TypeScript.

If you're tired of lots of try/catch or null checks for errors, this might help make things clearer.

Quick Example:

    import { Ok, Err, wrapInResult } from ""@ghaerdi/rustify""; // Wrap something that throws, like JSON.parse
    
    const safeParse = wrapInResult(JSON.parse);
    const result = safeParse('{""hello"": ""world""}'); // Ok({ hello: 'world' })
    console.log(result.unwrapOr({})); // -> { hello: 'world' }
    const badResult = safeParse('{invalid'); // Err(...)
    if (badResult.isErr()) {
      console.error(""Parse failed:"", badResult.err());
    }

Handles success/failure explicitly and is type-safe.

You can install via npm/jsr: @ghaerdi/rustify

Feedback welcome!

I recently put together a deep-dive analysis on what’s happening in the programming world right now — and honestly, it’s one of the most turbulent times I’ve seen in over 7 years in the industry.

Some key points I cover:

* The ongoing wave of layoffs and why it’s *still* happening in 2025
* How AI tools (Copilot, GPT-4.5, Claude 3, Gemini Ultra) are automating more coding tasks — and what that means for programmers
* The paradox of layoffs *and* a skills shortage, especially in AI, security, and cloud
* Why the demand is shifting from routine coding to architecture, integration, and AI literacy
* Emerging roles like AI Ops, prompt engineering, and AI governance
* The impact on both junior and senior devs, and how to adapt

I tried to make it a no-BS, realistic look at the challenges *and* opportunities ahead.

programming,1k3e0ax,Model Context Protocol - Exhaustively Explained,"Hey Redditors 👋,



I recently published a deep-dive technical blog on the Model Context Protocol (MCP)—a rising open standard introduced by Anthropic to let AI agents interact with external tools, data sources, and systems in a consistent and secure way.



🧠 What is MCP, in a nutshell? Think of it as the USB-C for AI agents. It allows LLMs to interact with real-world systems (APIs, files, databases, SaaS apps) using a common protocol that supports context fetching, tool usage, and secure operation. MCP removes the need for M×N integrations by standardizing the interface.



📘 The Blog Covers:



What is MCP and why it matters for AI

The M×N problem vs M+N elegance

Client-server architecture and message patterns (JSON-RPC 2.0)

Tools, Resources, and Prompts: the primitives

Transport options like HTTP + SSE

Security considerations (auth, isolation, rate limiting, audit logs)

Strategic adoption advice for enterprises



🧑‍💻 I also built a working demo on GitHub, using:



FastAPI MCP server exposing a sample tool via JSON-RPC

SSE endpoint to simulate real-time event streaming

Python client that lists and invokes tools via MCP



🔗 Read the blog: [https://srivatssan.medium.com/model-context-protocol-exhaustively-explained-f5a30a87a3ff?sk=1b971265640303c66b04377371c82102](https://srivatssan.medium.com/model-context-protocol-exhaustively-explained-f5a30a87a3ff?sk=1b971265640303c66b04377371c82102)

🔗 GitHub demo: [https://github.com/srivatssan/MCP-Demo](https://github.com/srivatssan/MCP-Demo)



🙏 What I'm Looking For:

I'm looking for feedback, improvements, and ideas from:



Architects implementing GenAI in production

Engineers working with agents, tools, or LangChain

AI security folks thinking about safe LLM integrations

Devs curious about protocol design for agent frameworks



I would really appreciate a review from folks who think critically about architecture, protocol interoperability, or just love breaking down new standards.

I am not someone who is lucky enough to work on frontier technologies. I try my best to catch up with evolution and share my learning with others who may not have the time I spent to learn the subject. So, in all fairness, I am looking for avenues to improve in blogging and adding meaningful value to the community.

programming,1jlt4s2,I tested out all of the best language models for frontend development. One model stood out amongst the rest.,"This week was an insane week for AI.

DeepSeek V3 was just released. According to the benchmarks, it the best AI model around, outperforming even reasoning models like Grok 3.

Just days later, Google released Gemini 2.5 Pro, again outperforming every other model on the benchmark.

[Pic: The performance of Gemini 2.5 Pro](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*O2_y5WVPjHStu2gdfZopqw.png)

With all of these models coming out, everybody is asking the same thing:

>“What is the best model for coding?” – our collective consciousness

This article will explore this question on a REAL frontend development task.

# Preparing for the task

To prepare for this task, we need to give the LLM enough information to complete it. Here’s how we’ll do it.

For context, I am building an algorithmic trading platform. One of the features is called “Deep Dives”, AI-Generated comprehensive due diligence reports.

[I wrote a full article on it here:](https://nexustrade.io/blog/introducing-deep-dive-dd-an-alternative-to-deep-research-for-financial-analysistasks-20250301)

Even though I’ve released this as a feature, I don’t have an SEO-optimized entry point to it. Thus, I thought to see how well each of the best LLMs can generate a landing page for this feature.

To do this:

1. I built a system prompt, stuffing enough context to one-shot a solution
2. I used the same system prompt for every single model
3. I evaluated the model *solely* on my subjective opinion on how good a job the frontend looks.

I started with the system prompt.

# Building the perfect system prompt

To build my system prompt, I did the following:

1. I gave it a markdown version of my article for context as to what the feature does
2. I gave it code samples of the single component that it would need to generate the page
3. Gave a list of constraints and requirements. For example, I wanted to be able to generate a report from the landing page, and I explained that in the prompt.

The final part of the system prompt was a detailed objective section that explained what we wanted to build.

    # OBJECTIVE
    Build an SEO-optimized frontend page for the deep dive reports. 
    While we can already do reports by on the Asset Dashboard, we want 
    this page to be built to help us find users search for stock analysis, 
    dd reports,
      - The page should have a search bar and be able to perform a report 
    right there on the page. That's the primary CTA
      - When the click it and they're not logged in, it will prompt them to 
    sign up
      - The page should have an explanation of all of the benefits and be 
    SEO optimized for people looking for stock analysis, due diligence 
    reports, etc
       - A great UI/UX is a must
       - You can use any of the packages in package.json but you cannot add any
       - Focus on good UI/UX and coding style
       - Generate the full code, and seperate it into different components 
    with a main page

[To read the full system prompt, I linked it publicly in this Google Doc.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vDIcrgP-CUMug1cRljMvU6sKOX1Ve_79CJ0qBgJZFi8/edit?tab=t.0)

Then, using this prompt, I wanted to test the output for all of the best language models: Grok 3, Gemini 2.5 Pro (Experimental), DeepSeek V3 0324, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet.

I organized this article from worse to best. Let’s start with the worse model out of the 4: Grok 3.

# Testing Grok 3 (thinking) in a real-world frontend task

[Pic: The Deep Dive Report page generated by Grok 3](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*j-COAuAnMa9x-eZM1RHwhg.png)

In all honesty, while I had high hopes for Grok because I used it in other challenging coding “thinking” tasks, in this task, Grok 3 did a very basic job. It outputted code that I would’ve expect out of GPT-4.

I mean just look at it. This isn’t an SEO-optimized page; I mean, who would use this?

In comparison, GPT o1-pro did better, but not by much.

# Testing GPT O1-Pro in a real-world frontend task

[Pic: The Deep Dive Report page generated by O1-Pro](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*fuZP8ajhCcOPwiu0R8T10A.png)

[Pic: Styled searchbar](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*QjsYa8zI4IXPDvZXemEIWw.png)

O1-Pro did a much better job at keeping the same styles from the code examples. It also looked better than Grok, especially the searchbar. It used the icon packages that I was using, and the formatting was generally pretty good.

But it absolutely was not production-ready. For both Grok and O1-Pro, the output is what you’d expect out of an intern taking their first Intro to Web Development course.

The rest of the models did a much better job.

# Testing Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental in a real-world frontend task

[Pic: The top two sections generated by Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*nkG7DL2n0eOXBIFR89eq9g.png)

[Pic: A full list of all of the previous reports that I have generated](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*jGaq0gt7drXaIO3mLbD7bw.png)

Gemini 2.5 Pro generated an amazing landing page on its first try. When I saw it, I was shocked. It looked professional, was heavily SEO-optimized, and completely met all of the requirements.

It re-used some of my other components, such as my display component for my existing [Deep Dive Reports page.](https://nexustrade.io/deep-dive-reports) After generating it, I was honestly expecting it to win…

Until I saw how good DeepSeek V3 did.

# Testing DeepSeek V3 0324 in a real-world frontend task

[Pic: The top two sections generated by Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*WSPn9cKs8YLJBUf90KP5zQ.png)

[Pic: The conclusion and call to action sections](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*8ZlNAQMq7QXKfsB0w9LaFA.png)

DeepSeek V3 did far better than I could’ve ever imagined. Being a non-reasoning model, I found the result to be extremely comprehensive. It had a hero section, an insane amount of detail, and even a testimonial sections. At this point, I was already shocked at how good these models were getting, and had thought that Gemini would emerge as the undisputed champion at this point.

Then I finished off with Claude 3.7 Sonnet. And wow, I couldn’t have been more blown away.

# Testing Claude 3.7 Sonnet in a real-world frontend task

[Pic: The top two sections generated by Claude 3.7 Sonnet](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*v1Wy_DffshdVxs3F3P5ORw.png)

[Pic: The benefits section for Claude 3.7 Sonnet](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*qFGAQge-UupxpwoqezE7rA.png)

[Pic: The call to action section generated by Claude 3.7 Sonnet](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*jlG6YX-ocMw6jCGAxaqZng.png)

Claude 3.7 Sonnet is on a league of its own. Using the same exact prompt, I generated an extraordinarily sophisticated frontend landing page that met my exact requirements and then some more.

It over-delivered. Quite literally, it had stuff that I wouldn’t have ever imagined. Not only does it allow you to generate a report directly from the UI, but it also had new components that described the feature, had SEO-optimized text, fully described the benefits, included a testimonials section, and more.

It was beyond comprehensive.

# Discussion beyond the subjective appearance

While the visual elements of these landing pages are each amazing, I wanted to briefly discuss other aspects of the code.

For one, some models did better at using shared libraries and components than others. For example, DeepSeek V3 and Grok failed to properly implement the “OnePageTemplate”, which is responsible for the header and the footer. In contrast, O1-Pro, Gemini 2.5 Pro and Claude 3.7 Sonnet correctly utilized these templates.

Additionally, the raw code quality was surprisingly consistent across all models, with no major errors appearing in any implementation. All models produced clean, readable code with appropriate naming conventions and structure.

Moreover, the components used by the models ensured that the pages were mobile-friendly. This is critical as it guarantees a good user experience across different devices. Because I was using Material UI, each model succeeded in doing this on its own.

Finally, Claude 3.7 Sonnet deserves recognition for producing the largest volume of high-quality code without sacrificing maintainability. It created more components and functionality than other models, with each piece remaining well-structured and seamlessly integrated. This demonstrates Claude’s superiority when it comes to frontend development.

# Caveats About These Results

While Claude 3.7 Sonnet produced the highest quality output, developers should consider several important factors when picking which model to choose.

First, every model except O1-Pro required manual cleanup. Fixing imports, updating copy, and sourcing (or generating) images took me roughly 1–2 hours of manual work, even for Claude’s comprehensive output. This confirms these tools excel at first drafts but still require human refinement.

Secondly, the cost-performance trade-offs are significant.

* [O1-Pro is by far the most expensive option](https://openrouter.ai/openai/o1-pro), at $150 per million input tokens and $600 per million output tokens. In contrast, the second most expensive model (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens. It also has a relatively low throughout like DeepSeek V3, at 18 tokens per second
* [Claude 3.7 Sonnet has 3x higher throughput than O1-Pro and is 50x cheaper](https://openrouter.ai/anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet). It also produced better code for frontend tasks. These results suggest that you should absolutely choose Claude 3.7 Sonnet over O1-Pro for frontend development
* [V3 is over 10x cheaper than Claude 3.7 Sonnet](https://openrouter.ai/deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324), making it ideal for budget-conscious projects. It’s throughout is similar to O1-Pro at 17 tokens per second
* [Meanwhile, Gemini Pro 2.5 currently offers free access and boasts the fastest processing at 2x Sonnet’s speed](https://openrouter.ai/google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free)
* Grok remains limited by its lack of API access.

Importantly, it’s worth discussing Claude’s “continue” feature. Unlike the other models, Claude had an option to continue generating code after it ran out of context — an advantage over one-shot outputs from other models. However, this also means comparisons weren’t perfectly balanced, as other models had to work within stricter token limits.

The “best” choice depends entirely on your priorities:

* Pure code quality → Claude 3.7 Sonnet
* Speed + cost → Gemini Pro 2.5 (free/fastest)
* Heavy, budget-friendly, or API capabilities → DeepSeek V3 (cheapest)

Ultimately, while Claude performed the best in this task, the ‘best’ model for you depends on your requirements, project, and what you find important in a model.

# Concluding Thoughts

With all of the new language models being released, it’s extremely hard to get a clear answer on which model is the best. Thus, I decided to do a head-to-head comparison.

In terms of pure code quality, Claude 3.7 Sonnet emerged as the clear winner in this test, demonstrating superior understanding of both technical requirements and design aesthetics. Its ability to create a cohesive user experience — complete with testimonials, comparison sections, and a functional report generator — puts it ahead of competitors for frontend development tasks. However, DeepSeek V3’s impressive performance suggests that the gap between proprietary and open-source models is narrowing rapidly.

With that being said, this article is based on my subjective opinion. It’s time to agree or disagree whether Claude 3.7 Sonnet did a good job, and whether the final result looks reasonable.

I’m Krishil Rohit Sheth, and for the last 4 years I’ve been working on a new algorithm (RPF) to **square large numbers faster than Karatsuba** — and even **outperforming FFT** for up to 800 digits.

🧠 **What’s unique about RPF**:

* **Beats Karatsuba** in raw performance and scalability
* **Still faster** even when both are GMP-optimized
* **Outruns FFT** for small to medium digit sizes (1 to < 800 digits)

I’ve benchmarked it across multiple sizes and built-in enhancements, and the results show promising improvements in:

* Cryptography (modular squaring)
* Big-number libraries (GMP, Java BigInteger, Libgcrypt, etc.)
* Blockchain, simulations, and HPC workloads

programming,1jt0svx,I tested the best language models for SQL query generation. Google wins hands down.,"[*Copy-pasting this article from Medium to Reddit*](https://medium.com/p/42d29fc8e37e)

Today, Meta released Llama 4, but that’s not the point of this article.

Because for my task, this model sucked.

However, when evaluating this model, I accidentally discovered something about Google Gemini Flash 2. While I *subjectively* thought it was one of the best models for SQL query generation, my evaluation proves it definitively. Here’s a comparison of Google Gemini Flash 2.0 and every other major large language model. Specifically, I’m testing it against:

* DeepSeek V3 (03/24 version)
* Llama 4 Maverick
* And Claude 3.7 Sonnet

# Performing the SQL Query Analysis

To analyze each model for this task, I used [EvaluateGPT](https://github.com/austin-starks/EvaluateGPT),

[Link: Evaluate the effectiveness of a system prompt within seconds!](https://github.com/austin-starks/EvaluateGPT)

EvaluateGPT is an open-source model evaluation framework. It uses LLMs to help analyze the accuracy and effectiveness of different language models. We evaluate prompts based on accuracy, success rate, and latency.

**The Secret Sauce Behind the Testing**

How did I actually test these models? I built a custom evaluation framework that hammers each model with 40 carefully selected financial questions. We’re talking everything from basic stuff like “What AI stocks have the highest market cap?” to complex queries like “Find large cap stocks with high free cash flows, PEG ratio under 1, and current P/E below typical range.”

Each model had to generate SQL queries that actually ran against a massive financial database containing everything from stock fundamentals to industry classifications. I didn’t just check if they worked — I wanted *perfect* results. The evaluation was brutal: execution errors meant a zero score, unexpected null values tanked the rating, and only flawless responses hitting exactly what was requested earned a perfect score.

The testing environment was completely consistent across models. Same questions, same database, same evaluation criteria. I even tracked execution time to measure real-world performance. This isn’t some theoretical benchmark — it’s real SQL that either works or doesn’t when you try to answer actual financial questions.

By using EvaluateGPT, we have an objective measure of how each model performs when generating SQL queries perform. More specifically, the process looks like the following:

1. Use the LLM to generate a plain English sentence such as “What was the total market cap of the S&P 500 at the end of last quarter?” into a SQL query
2. Execute that SQL query against the database
3. Evaluate the results. If the query fails to execute or is inaccurate (as judged by another LLM), we give it a low score. If it’s accurate, we give it a high score

Using this tool, I can quickly evaluate which model is best on a set of 40 financial analysis questions. To read what questions were in the set or to learn more about the script, [check out the open-source repo.](https://github.com/austin-starks/EvaluateGPT)

Here were my results.

# Which model is the best for SQL Query Generation?

[Pic: Performance comparison of leading AI models for SQL query generation. Gemini 2.0 Flash demonstrates the highest success rate (92.5%) and fastest execution, while Claude 3.7 Sonnet leads in perfect scores (57.5%).](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*ieHOuVcOQM37CChQfpnXbQ.png)

Figure 1 (above) shows which model delivers the best overall performance on the range.

The data tells a clear story here. Gemini 2.0 Flash straight-up dominates with a 92.5% success rate. That’s better than models that cost way more.

Claude 3.7 Sonnet did score highest on perfect scores at 57.5%, which means when it works, it tends to produce really high-quality queries. But it fails more often than Gemini.

Llama 4 and DeepSeek? They struggled. Sorry Meta, but your new release isn’t winning this contest.

# Cost and Performance Analysis

[Pic: Cost Analysis: SQL Query Generation Pricing Across Leading AI Models in 2025. This comparison reveals Claude 3.7 Sonnet’s price premium at 31.3x higher than Gemini 2.0 Flash, highlighting significant cost differences for database operations across model sizes despite comparable performance metrics.](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*kP_out7B2gh94jCvZzAgNA.png)

Now let’s talk money, because the cost differences are wild.

Claude 3.7 Sonnet costs 31.3x more than Gemini 2.0 Flash. That’s not a typo. Thirty-one times more expensive.

Gemini 2.0 Flash is cheap. Like, really cheap. And it performs better than the expensive options for this task.

If you’re running thousands of SQL queries through these models, the cost difference becomes massive. We’re talking potential savings in the thousands of dollars.

Gemini 2.0 Flash dominates with a 40x better cost-performance ratio than Claude 3.7 Sonnet, combining highest success rate (92.5%) with lowest cost. DeepSeek struggles with execution time while Llama offers budget performance trade-offs.”](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*P1_PsRK9OjteUK-o3_OJVQ.png)

Figure 3 tells the real story. When you combine performance and cost:

Gemini 2.0 Flash delivers a 40x better cost-performance ratio than Claude 3.7 Sonnet. That’s insane.

DeepSeek is slow, which kills its cost advantage.

Llama models are okay for their price point, but can’t touch Gemini’s efficiency.

# Why This Actually Matters

Look, SQL generation isn’t some niche capability. It’s central to basically any application that needs to talk to a database. Most enterprise AI applications need this.

The fact that the cheapest model is actually the best performer turns conventional wisdom on its head. We’ve all been trained to think “more expensive = better.” Not in this case.

Gemini Flash wins hands down, and it’s better than every single new shiny model that dominated headlines in recent times.

# Some Limitations

I should mention a few caveats:

* My tests focused on financial data queries
* I used 40 test questions — a bigger set might show different patterns
* This was one-shot generation, not back-and-forth refinement
* Models update constantly, so these results are as of April 2025

But the performance gap is big enough that I stand by these findings.

# Conclusion: Stop Wasting Money on the Wrong Models

Here’s the bottom line: for SQL query generation, Google’s Gemini Flash 2 is both better and dramatically cheaper than the competition.

This has real implications:

1. Stop defaulting to the most expensive model for every task
2. Consider the cost-performance ratio, not just raw performance
3. Test multiple models regularly as they all keep improving

If you’re building apps that need to generate SQL at scale, you’re probably wasting money if you’re not using Gemini Flash 2. It’s that simple.

I’m curious to see if this pattern holds for other specialized tasks, or if SQL generation is just Google’s sweet spot. Either way, the days of automatically choosing the priciest option are over.",0,0.35,23,2025-04-06 18:25:08,https://medium.com/p/42d29fc8e37e,Starks-Technology

I treated Claude like a teammate: it wrote implementation plans, generated code and tests, and I reviewed/adjusted everything step by step. Overall: surprisingly effective, but definitely not magic. You still need to steer architecture, break down logic carefully, and manage test strategy — or it all falls apart.

I wrote a detailed breakdown of the process, tools I used (Claude + JetBrains), mistakes I made, and things that actually worked.
