movies,1k5evq0,Going to the movies by myself has become one of my favorite things to do,"In recent weeks I have seen two different movies (Drop and Warfare) on my own. As much as I do like going to the movies with people to of course be able to react to things together, there is something I have really started to enjoy about going by myself. 

It’s almost like de-stressing after a long day where you just don’t want to have to talk to anyone and can sit in a dark theater, enjoy a snack and watch the film. 

I’m not even necessarily super introverted it’s just become my thing, does anyone else enjoy this? 

Also another part of it is if there is a movie you want to see that others don’t, I don’t think you should be stopped from watching it. ",118,0.9,35,2025-04-22 19:16:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1k5evq0/going_to_the_movies_by_myself_has_become_one_of/,Askanything236
movies,1k2h2x6,Great Actor That Deserves Praise:  Jack O'Connell,"Jack O'Connell is an English actor who hasn't risen to huge fame (yet) but is tremendous in most things that he has been in.

  
I saw him a long time ago on Skins and he stole every scene he was in. Skins is a breeding ground for talented British actors like Daniel Kaluuya, Nicholas Hoult, Dev Patel and many more.  When he was on screen with the likes of these guys, he really stood out.

I think his biggest US movie was Unbroken, directed by Angelina Jolie, where he was the main character.  Physical role and he carried it well.

I just think this dude should get more visibility because hes a great actor with a lot of promise.,",90,0.83,46,2025-04-18 22:10:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1k2h2x6/great_actor_that_deserves_praise_jack_oconnell/,AcrobaticRock9927
movies,1jz0din,Movies Where The Villians Win,"Without spoiling anything, some of the examples that immediately leap to mind on this subject are The Empire Strikes Back and Avengers: Infinity War.

movies,1jxvqxf,The Back to the Future Trilogy. The perfect trilogy.,"Today is day two of a three day BTTF rewatch. Yesterday i watched BTTF, i've just finished watching BTTF 2 and tomorrow i'll watch 3.

I have seen all three films multiple times, I have read and watched all sorts of behind the scenes trivia and details about them. I know these films and yet they, especially 2, are flawless. I know what to look for, the subtle clues that all is not as it seems and even knowing what i'm looking at and where I still either don't notice or it's not distracting.

For example i know at some point Marty appears to have three hands, i didn't notice as I was so engrossed in the film I forgot to look.

The dinner scene is still my favourite scene, it is so perfect, you have three copies of Michael J. Fox interacting around the same table and even knowing that and seeing the scene multiple times over pretty much all my life I still find it utterly perfect. As a young child I didn't realise Marlene was also played by Michael J. Fox, i thought they got an actress in. I realised later on though, possibly the third or fourth time I watched it,

There is a scene just as they arrive back in 1985 and the car lands and turns into a driveway, in real life this is a model landing then the lamppost is used to cover up the transition between model and real car yet it is superb, i have watched the scene many times and yet its perfect, it is so smooth. [See it here](https://youtu.be/rhNDsPMaK_A?t=454) I have watched it frame by frame and it's still flawless. 

Then there are the plot threads, there are no loose ends, it just all works, there are elements used from the first film and in 2 there are setups for scenes in 3. Everything is neat, Well apart from the second car in the third film but i'm sure the lack of spare parts for a DeLorean in the 1950s stopped them from cannibalising it for parts, it's mostly just an educated guess though.

I love the first film, I do, the little changes in the 1980s setup in the 1950s are really quite nice and they add much to a rewatch. Like I said though, the second film is the best, utterly amazing, some of the effects are a bit dated but so are the effects in Jason and the Argonauts and I still watch that. I'm not going to criticise any old film for dated effects, it's not like they had access to modern tech.

Anyway if, for some bizarre reason, you have not seen these films go and watch them.",88,0.74,43,2025-04-13 00:44:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jxvqxf/the_back_to_the_future_trilogy_the_perfect_trilogy/,Martipar

movies,1jtuoqr,How a friendly grandmother's daily walks indirectly gave WALL-E its voice,"In the fall of 2004, I had just moved 2000 miles to northern California to start my new job in the animation industry. Each weekend, I would visit my grandmother who lived in Marin county and spend the day with her. My grandmother was an amazing woman, she was the type who kept detailed notes of all your preferences so she could provide the best experiences for her guests. For example, each time I visited, she had made my favorite sandwich with the exact proportions of condiments and meats I preferred with absolutely no tomatoes anywhere nearby, purchased my favorite soda (she would never keep soda in her own fridge as she did not like it, so she always bough one fresh the day I visited), and have a selection of candies I liked (or at least which she remember I liked from when I was 5). One of our favorite things to do together was walk through her neighborhood and talk with her neighbors. My grandmother lived in her neighborhood for nearly 30 years, and her husband had lived there for 80 years, so between them they knew the history of every house and of her friends inside. She walked her neighborhood every day, and each time she saw someone outside of their house she would stop and talk with them. If she knew someone’s daily schedule she would time her walks so that she would see them outside and conveniently have their favorite cookies with her to give to them. Each weekend, my grandmother and I would walk the one mile loop and she gave me updates on all her neighbors, which numbered at least 30 families. As we passed each house, she’d tell me whose kids just got into college, who changed jobs, the successes of each kid, their favorite foods and movies, etc. She was like a living newsletter, and I loved hearing my grandmother excitedly tell each story. 


One day during our walk, she was giving me the latest scoop on her neighbor Ben, a kind man with a wonderful wife and lovely young daughter, who creates sounds for movies. As we approached Ben’s house, a car pulled into his driveway directly in front of us and a man in his 50s stepped out. “Oh, hey, that’s Ben,” she said, waving to him as he walked to open his passenger-side door. He turned to us, smiled, said “hi”, and as he opened his passenger-side door, out tumbled his laptop, crashing onto the concrete with the screen still open. He shouted a boomer-sanitized expletive and I instinctively rushed over to help him pick it up. As I did, I glanced at the screen.

What I saw stopped me in my tracks: two figures were battling with glowing swords over a river of lava. I immediately recognized it as the ending duel from *Episode III: Revenge of the Sith*. Now, this was September 2004 and that movie wasn’t due out until May 2005. This was the biggest movie everyone was talking about and counting down to. Fans knew that the end of the movie was supposed to be a climatic duel between Obi-wan and Anakin on the lava planet of Mustafar which leads to the creation of Darth Vader as we know him, but everyone was guessing how it would happen. Any hint of leaks were highly valued and reported on sites like Ain’t It Cool News, Dark Horizons, and ComingSoon.net. A modern equivalent would be to unknowingly stumble upon the “On your left” portals scene from Avengers Endgame 8 months before it came out. And here I was, staring at the scene I had been imagining ever since I read about Darth Vader’s origins nearly two decades earlier.


That’s when I realized that “Ben” wasn’t just any neighbor. He was [*Ben Burtt*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Burtt), the legendary sound designer behind the *Star Wars* and *Indiana Jones* franchises. He created the sounds of lightsabers, R2-D2’s beeps, Indy’s whip, Darth Vader’s breathing, and even secretly inserted the “[Wilhelm scream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YDpuA90KEY)” into his movies which led to its modern popularity. He shaped the audio landscape of every major Lucasfilm movie and show for decades. But to my grandmother, who hadn’t watched any of those films, he was just “Ben”, the friendly neighbor with a lovely wife and daughter. 


I gasped, “Holy cow, that’s *Episode III*,” and Ben quickly shut the laptop and tried to do a Jedi mind trick of telling us it was not what we thought it was. I backed off, understanding the sensitivity of what I'd seen and how his literal job was at stake. My grandmother, ever the social butterfly, then introduced us properly, and we got to talking. I mentioned that I just started working in the industry and we shared stories. Ben invited us inside, introduced us to his wife and daughter, and even showed us his [Oscars](https://postimg.cc/yWW7D52w). After a pleasant visit, we thanked him and continued on our neighborhood loop. I was over the moon about the experience, and my grandmother was just happy to have been able to talk to her friends, and to see me happy too. 


At the start of the story I mentioned I had just started working in the animation industry. Well, that was somewhat burying the lede, because the next part is how we get to Wall-E:


At that time, I was working at Pixar Animation Studios on the movie which would eventually become *Ratatouille*. But that movie was still years away, instead, Pixar’s next movie, *The Incredibles*, was about to release in a couple weeks. Soon after my interaction with Ben, Pixar held the “[Cast and Crew](https://postimg.cc/f3BhLjCz)” screening of *The Incredibles* where all the people who worked on the film [came together](https://postimg.cc/gX7Fyz11) and watched the final product. Along with all the artists and developers, the voice cast was there, as were [Steve Jobs, Ed Catmull, John Lasseter, and Brad Bird](https://postimg.cc/pmMv1dyH). The movie played to thunderous applause, and people cheered when [ahem] *incredibly* difficult technical scenes were shown, such as when Mr. Incredible arrives on the island via an underwater path and all the water drains from the hangar.

At the end of the crew screening, John Lasseter announced that “Friends and Family screenings would begin in two weeks”. These were preview screenings shown at the Pixar building where the crew could invite anyone to see the movie weeks before it came out. I remembered Ben’s daughter was really excited about The Incredibles, so on my next walk with my grandmother we went to his house where I invited his family to join the “Friends and Family” screening.


The day of the friends screening [arrived](https://postimg.cc/DmDnL6Tm) and I met Ben and his family at the [Emeryville studio](https://postimg.cc/K17bXygg). Before the movie started I gave them a tour of all the areas which guests were allowed to visit and showed them all [*The Incredibles* art](https://postimg.cc/SXyhktW1) and decor adorning the walls (Pixar always redecorates its buildings with art and [full-size statues](https://postimg.cc/1nX1Nn7p) from their next release). When it came time for the movie to start we shuffled into the theater, performed the “oohs” and “aahs” as the pre-show shooting stars appeared on the theater ceiling (a Pixar tradition), and then watched the movie. Spoiler alert: Ben’s daughter loved it, as did everyone else. There is just something magical about seeing a movie in the building where it was created and surrounded by the creators. 


After the credits finished rolling (never leave before the credits at these screenings), I walked with Ben to introduce him to a few of my coworkers. One of them was the late, great [Ralph Eggleston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Eggleston), a Pixar veteran who had joined the studio for *Toy Story* and touched everything after. When I had first met Ralph he was also working on the *not-yet-titled-little-chef* film, but soon he moved to a top-secret project which was coming out after that one. With the Pixar-Disney partnership ending after *Cars*, all work on later movies was kept under strict wraps, especially from Disney-affiliated people to avoid a Bug’s Life/Antz fiasco once Pixar broke free from Disney (note: Disney ended up not renewing the partnership with Pixar and instead flat-out bought them, many artists' tears were shed). The only thing I knew about Ralph’s project was it had something to do with space based on the cryptic images on his office door. Ralph and I had bonded earlier on *Ratatouille* as we had both grown up in the deep South in relatively small towns and were shocked that we ended up making major movies in CA, although his resume at that time was far, far more impressive than my single, unreleased movie. 


When I introduced Ralph to Ben, Ralph immediately recognized the name and geeked out over his *Star Wars* credentials. I shouldn’t have been surprised, Pixar, and animation/game studios in general, are full of *Star Wars* fans who know every bit of geeky minutia about the series and recognize obscure names who worked on the films (myself included, hence the origin of this story). As Ralph is geeking out, he tells Ben he is working on a project right up his alley. Ralph then waved someone over from across the room. That someone turned out to be [John Lasseter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lasseter), founding member and chief creative officer at Pixar. 


I don’t know John Lasseter. I had never truly met John Lasseter at that time. Technically he addressed me when he spoke to the audience at the ""Cast and Crew"" screening. And I once walked past him in a nearly empty hallway and he vaguely nodded at me in acknowledgment. Yet suddenly I was in a 4-way discussion with him about a project no one could really talk about due to Disney’s spies being everywhere. *Star Wars* geekiness was shared, comments that “we’ll be in touch” were floated, and soon Ben and I were on our own and I had no idea what had just happened. We met up with Ben’s family, listened to more excitement from his daughter about the movie, and eventually parted ways.


Over the following months Ben and I kept in touch, mostly through my grandmother and our walks. She proudly told all her neighbors that Ben had visited her grandson’s workplace, and that he’d had a wonderful time. A few months later, *Episode III* came out. It was a hit, the final lightsaber battle was incredible, and I made a point to stop by Ben’s house and congratulate him on his amazing work. We finally were able to talk about the fight scene which I “did not see what I thought I saw” months before.


I kept working at Pixar for a while, eventually moving off of *Ratatouille* and Pixar in general just before the Jan Pinkava/Brad Bird transition. I saw Ben less often, but my grandmother kept in touch with him during her walks. I learned through her that he was soon possibly going to work at Pixar and I was curious what he could be working on. The one time I asked he was cagey about it, doing another Jedi mind trick that it wasn’t what I thought it was.

 
Years later, I’m watching a futuristic film set in a post-human world filled with trash, cockroaches, and a single robot. Twenty minutes into the film, the title character, WALL-E, upon meeting the sleek EVE robot, mispronounces her name as “Ev-a” with a technical flare. And once again, Ben Burtt’s hard work was causing me to fall in love with these inanimate objects through their various beeps and other electronic noises. 


Sadly, my grandmother passed away a few years later, around the same time I completely left the animation industry. I fell out of touch with most of my Pixar and ILM contacts from that time. But when I think back on my grandmother I smile knowing about her unexpected contribution to the film industry. Now, I know the film industry is a relatively small, close-knit industry. If someone is making a robot film and they need someone to create voices for those robots then Ben Burtt is the top person on the list. He would have ended up on WALL-E no matter what. But I like to think that in this timeline, my grandmother’s penchant for talking to all her neighbors during her walks indirectly led to WALL-E and EVE getting their voices.

For me, it's always been an enjoyable comedy with a good message at the end. Elizabeth Hurley and Brendan Fraser's chemistry in the movie really helps it shine. To me, it's one of the better comedy remakes that has been done.

The movie also has a ton of quotable lines from each of the wishes he has.",71,0.8,92,2025-04-09 17:08:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jvb0fj/bedazzled2000/,SpreadElectronic1232
movies,1jva93u,What is your favorite random movie with an all-star cast?,There are plenty of big-time movies that has an awesome all-star cast like a lot of the films that were up for awards during awards season but there always seems to be a random film that has an all-star cast. With one of my favorites being Chef. Chef is a nice feel-good film about a father and son bonding over summer vacation as they travel across the U.S operating a food truck but it has 1 of the most loaded casts that I've ever seen with half the cast becoming Avengers and Jon Favreau becoming 1 of the big wigs at 1 of if not the most powerful media companies on Earth as well two of the biggest Hispanic actors in the U.S John Leguizamo and Sofia Vergara. The only person that wasn't a super star was the child actor player the son.

movies,1k55u1w,I just finished Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro (1979)...wow. just WOW. Hayao Miyazaki was THAT good from the begining. This just became one of my favourite heist movies,"I randomly decided to give this a watch. I've heard this is Hayao Miyazaki's first feature film and his directorial debut. It's still a couple years before studio Ghibli was established. Oh this blew my mind on multiple levels.


This was also my first Lupin The Third experience. I...I don't know how I've lived my life so far without having ever experienced the Lupin series. I'm hooked bro. I'm so hooooked. I'm gonna go out of my way and watch a couple more Lupin III movies after this. This was my first introduction to the Lupin cast and I'm already deeply in love with them and feeling nostalgic. Lupin, Jigen, Goemon, Fujiko, Zenigata. Brilliant characters.



This is 70's anime. When animation was still colored flat. And this movie still looks like a masterpiece. The background art is so gorgeous and lovely.


Cagliostro feels so green and lush and cozy. Which is a classic Miyzaki trademark. The aesthetuc choices for the enviorment deisgn is just magnificent.


I understand this is also more Miyazaki and less Lupin The Third as far as characterization and story goes. A bit more lighthearted and whimsical than how classic Lupin is. I personally had no complaints about that at all. I think it plays well into the character.",78,0.87,21,2025-04-22 13:06:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1k55u1w/i_just_finished_lupin_iii_the_castle_of/,Wonder-Lad-2Mad

movies,1jzl6c4,Reign Over Me,"This movie is so slept on. Sandler is raw in a way that’s almost uncomfortable, like you’re watching a real person spiral and heal in real time. It’s not showy grief, but it’s a sorta it’s muffled grief, which hits wayyyy harder IMO. The way he talks about his wife and kids, or more often doesn’t, is quietly devastating. Cheadle as well is phenomenal in this. He is always a perfect grounding force. In that scene in the courtroom where Sandler finally lets it out, feels like a cracked dam during a hurricane. Easily one of Sandler’s most emotionally truthful roles, it feels like he’s in the same headspace as like Uncut Gems but inverted. If that one is manic desperation then Reign Over Me is him suffering from a severe stillness in sorrow.

Because he didn’t try to make things grander than they were, or add a lot of bigger more epic things for dramatic purposes. He stayed completely true to real life even though the case in real life went nowhere. Telling the story through the eyes of Jake Gyllenhaal playing the real life cartoonist was the perfect way to tell the story for the film, because that’s where the letters were being sent, so we slowly learn the case at the same time as everyone else is learning about it reading the sent letters. Robert Downey Jr is fantastic as always, and this is by far my favorite performance from Mark Ruffalo!

She's a phenomenal fighter, probably the best martial arts movie star the World has ever had. I love Michelle Yeoh but she is not a real fighter like Cynthia, she's more of a dancer in the same vein as Zhang Ziyi. That said, Cynthia Rothrock is a mediocre actress. 

And in Hollywood, she mostly did DTV movies. THe China O'Brien films, that one she did where she played a bodyguard to some rich dude which was so bad that it was a chore to watch it to the end.

movies,1jioin1,"9 (2009), the machine was meant to be the hero. (Mini essay)","
Not all of Chekhov’s guns have to be physical objects, for instance we see it all the time in monster movies. The monsters weakness is revealed or discovered, and later used against it. To give the audience the information that the werewolf is weak to silver, but never put it into practice, creates the same narrative void as is the protagonist found a physical “anti werewolf gun” only to never use it.    
    
I would like to bring up the fact that the whole movie, 9(2009), is built around an unfired ‘Chekhov’s idea.’ We are directly given information that in my mind, built up a completely different and non-traditional ending that I was so excited for, only for the movie to fall on it’s face into the ‘generic ending’ puddle, including a good ol’, out of nowhere, Deus Ex Machina.   
    
A quick synopsis:
The movie 9 is set in a post apocalyptic world, the story starts with a scientist, the last remaining human, transferring the last part of his soul into a sack puppet using a device referred to as the Talisman. The scientist dies after the transfer.   
    
The newly created sack puppet, labelled ‘9,’ heads off into the apocalyptic wasteland, only to be attacked by demonic robot creations. 9 eventually meets up with sack puppets 1-8. Hijinks ensue and eventually we meet the evil ‘Fabrication Machine,’ an evil machine that was corrupted by the warmongering government, resulting in it building murder machines that eventually turned on humanity and led to the lifeless wasteland the movie takes place in.   
    
The evil Fabrication Machine obtains the soul transfer Talisman, and begins hunting down the sack puppets, eventually sucking the souls out of 1, 2, 5, 6 and 8 into itself.   
    
For the grand finale, 9 gets the Talisman back from the Fabrication Machine, and suddenly the Talisman that has up until now only ever been a soul transference device, becomes a Deus Ex Machina laser that goes pew pew pew and kills the Machine, freeing the souls of the sack puppets (but not reviving them.) Ultimately this ending leaves just 3, 4, 7 and 9 to a bleak future, just the four of them in the endless expanse of a ruined world.   
   
Now, what is the Chekhov’s information I want to moan about? Throughout the movie we learn the following:   

•	The Scientist from the beginning is the one who created the Fabrication Machine, he was a good man who built the machine to build and create for peace.  

•	The Fabrication Machine is corrupted by the government, but the Scientist specifically says that: “My creation was hopelessly flawed and indeed dangerous, for it lacked the human soul”.   

•	The Scientist with his benevolent soul, has transferred his soul into the 9 sack puppets. “You are all that's left of humanity. You are all the pieces of my soul.”.  

•	The Fabrication Machine could easily destroy the sack puppets physically, but seems to go out of its way to specifically absorb their souls using the talisman. Note that the machine already has a specific slot/port on it to use the talisman presumably designed and installed by the Scientist.    
    
So what ending did I see being built up with this information? Lets review:    
     
•	The machine is designed to create, it just chooses to create death. It still could create life, at least artificial life, should it have a change of heart.   

•	The machine is evil specifically because it lacks a soul, however the Scientist included a way for it to absorb souls, since it already has a port for the Talisman. This implies the Scientist already had the Talisman and soul transfer technology before building the Fabrication Machine.   

•	The Scientist transferred his ‘good soul’ into 9 sack puppets. The Machine hunts down the Talisman and sack puppets, prioritising absorbing their segments of soul over physically destroying them.   

•	Did the scientist plan this all along? Was the machine always meant to have a soul, but the government stopped him? Was releasing his soul into the wasteland in the form of sack puppets a desperate attempt at self-preservation, or a last ditch effort to provide his corrupted creation with the soul it both needs and craves to fulfil its original benevolent purpose?      
     
So, what happens if the machine captures all 9 puppets? It’ll have a complete soul, the one thing it needed to not be a dick. Maybe it can find and help any remaining humans, or just create a new world of its own creations?    
     
A lot of this information was dumped on the main character, 9, right at the end, just before he laser blasts the machine. However, the end I saw coming, and was really excited about, was the idea that 9 would have to convince or trick the remaining sack puppets to sacrifice themselves to the Fabrication Machine, allowing the Scientist’s soul to reform the machine and start rebuilding the world.     
     
Pros of my ending:    
Interesting, dramatic, unexpected. Something different from the usual Hollywood happy-ever-after. In my opinion the original ending is actually pretty bleak, yeah they defeated the BBEG but there’s nothing left of the world, just the four remaining sack puppets, two of which are mute with childlike personalities. The original ending doesn’t set up any kind of post-movie goals or motivation for the remaining sack puppets, they don’t even need to eat or drink. Do the characters plan to just sit in a ruined building somewhere and twiddle their thumbs?    
     
Cons of my ending:    
It’s heavily implied that the Scientist was the last human, there isn’t really any world for the Fabrication Machine to rebuild once it turns good. Maybe there are survivors or untouched countries beyond the setting of the movie? The Scientists plan of just releasing his soul through sock puppets and just hoping that his machine eventually hunts them all down is a bit convoluted, could he not just find the machine himself?    
      
It’s noted on: https://nine.fandom.com/wiki/Deleted_Scenes - Trivia.    
      
“At some point during the preproduction, they had an adaptation where 9's soul actually gets sucked into the Fabrication Machine, and meets its soul to discover that the Machine was really ""0"".”.  
    
Which hints at a similar concept, but implies the Scientist put the evil part of his soul into the Machine?

I like Much Ado About Nothing well enough but I could probably recite it because there was a period in the 90s when it was ALWAYS ON the Disney channel. 

Don't Tell Mom The Babysitter's Dead happens to be a movie I love...but mostly because HBO wore it out. 

Toy Soldiers was in heavy, HEAVY rotation on TNT. It's another one I weirdly cherish not because I loved it, necessarily, but because it was just a constant background sound to certain times in my life.

movies,1k4ufeo,Just bought a Possessor poster. Brandon Cronenberg is doing his father proud—this might be one of the smartest shockers I’ve seen.,"I think \*Possessor\* (2020) is an absolute beast of a film. Grotesque, potent, and genuinely intelligent — not just another slick horror concept, but a brutal, evocative exploration of identity, corporate ethics, and psychological fragmentation. The idea of possession-as-a-service for assassination, with plausible deniability baked into its very mechanics (“no one would believe it anyway”), is such a strong sci-fi premise. But what really blew me away is how \*\*expertly it’s implemented\*\*.

The creative violence feels like early Rodriguez if he had a Cronenberg soul. Every shock is earned, not just stylized — and that final stretch? Devastating. Cronenberg Jr. Doesn’t just live up to his dad’s legacy — he’s mutating it into something uniquely his own.

I loved it so much I bought a poster. Next on my haul is \*Possession\* (1981), which I’ve heard is equally deranged but in a totally different register.

Anyone else vibe with \*Possessor\* this hard? Or have other twisted, intelligent horror recs in the same lane?",52,0.73,17,2025-04-22 01:30:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1k4ufeo/just_bought_a_possessor_poster_brandon_cronenberg/,mikebwriter

Although I've never been religious, I've always thought this was a great movie, primarily for the cinematography, acting, and script.

I also like their interpretation of the first 30 years of Moses' life, which isn't in the Bible, and adds a great deal to the context of the story. I also like the added drama concerning Nefertiri as well as Lidia, Joshua, and Dathan.

Omg I love, love, loved this movie. 


It's so easy to love Christopher Reeves as Superman, but omg the extanded cast is great too. Margot Kidder is so adorable as Lois Lane, Gene Hackman (r.i.p.) is the perfect amount of comedic relief as Lex Luthor and Terence Stamp has insane presence as Zod. What a voice, holy shit.



The practical effects in this movie blew my mind. I mean that genuinely and scinerely. I kept doubting the movie to manage and depict the powers of the Kryptonians at every turn, and I was constantly proven wrong. This movie makes you believe that a man can tear down a building with his hands.


I can praise this movie up and down, the Kryptonian trio are a great addition to this movie over the first one. Zod and Ursa are so captivating. And may I add, Sarah Douglas as Ursa is hot as *fuck*.


God how did they manage to capture so much charm and imagination decades before the comic book movie was even a thing.


There are stakes in this movie, and yet it's so lightheared, it's an action story, but I enjoyed the romance of it, it's a silly cartoon and yet the drama is sincere and earnest etc.

I always check to see if they have subtitles, as there are still some movies out there that are still released without them. Because I'm Deaf, I have to have subtitles on at all times, and I understand that even hearing people are having it on too, as not to miss anything. As more movies are being added to the physical formats, a few glaring issues are starting to arise.


**Special Features**

As most of you will know, a lot of these movies come with special features and commentaries from people who worked on the movies. These are great additions to the movies or shows that would make any fan happy to watch; however, releases from boutique studios, such as Criterion, Arrow, Shout, and many others have chosen not to subtitle any of the large swath of special features. Imagine my disappointment when I buy ""The Lighthouse"" from Arrow, and I am extremely curious about the behind-the-scenes of it, only for none of it to be subtitled. Same for my recent purchases of ""No Country for Old Men"" *(Criterion)*, ""Paris, Texas"" *(Criterion)*, ""Trick r Treat"" *(Arrow)*, ""RoboCop 2"" *(Shout Factory)*, and so many more titles in my library. I haven't checked ""Seven Samurai"" from BFI yet out of fear of disappointment that it too will be lacking subtitles. I am willing to bet that 90% of these boutique studios' releases have not subtitled any of them. I have tried not to let it bother me as I am appreciative of owning my favorite movies, but I can't help but grow increasingly frustrated with the lack of implementation of subtitles on special features, especially if they are used as major selling points on the back of the box or in release announcements. Especially considering it may be baked into the price of the movies.

**Foreign Films**

Criterion's most recent release of ""Godzilla vs Biollante"" is what urged me to finally speak up about this problem. I was excited to finally watch this movie, only for the first few lines of the movie, which were spoken in English, to be translated into Japanese. I was immediately disappointed as a few minutes later into the movie, another conversation is being had, and it is being translated into Japanese rather than English. I turned it off and put it away. I have thought of returning it and getting my money back, but in the end I decided to keep it. I looked around in the hopes of getting in contact with someone at Criterion. There was an email address for a person, so I decided to get in touch with him. Unfortunately, I've had no response. Many foreign film releases have fallen into this trap of not translating any English spoken dialogue, and there were no options to resolve that. Netflix, Criterion, and others have repeatedly done so, leaving me confused about what is happening plot-wise.

**Unnecessary Censorship**

Going back to Criterion, I recently watched ""Ed Wood"" on their streaming service, and my wife noticed something odd with their subtitles. With ""Ed Wood"" the subtitles were completely replacing curse words with more family friendly versions. This is one of the more common problems with many streaming services where they will often replace or censor curse words as if all of us deaf people are extremely sensitive to harsh language. I understand that most of these services or releases may have accidentally added the TV versions of the subtitles, and it can happen.

**Conclusion**

With the ever growing library of physical media and more movies being released through boutique studios becoming a far more major player in this, I understand that they may not have the budget, time, or access to provide subtitles. Sometimes, they just don't think about including such accessibility for them. It has grown increasingly difficult to reach out to these studios and have a direct conversation about what can be done in the future, where I don't feel like I'm wasting my money and dissuade me from future purchases.",47,0.71,25,2025-04-01 15:16:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1joy4oi/calling_out_criterion_arrow_shout_factory_and/,A_Zombie1223

movies,1juw2vi,Withnail and I (1987),"I saw Withnail and I just the other night and have since watched it on repeat as its so British, so funny, charming, poetic and yet a Tragic tale of friendship

i didn't realise immediately that it's set in the 60s

2 struggling actors who spend what little they've got on booze and occasionally drugs in their squalid home get the opportunity to spend the weekend with Withnail's uncle Monty out in the country

And it just gets funnier and occasionally awkward

Richard E Grant is fantastic in his film debut and totally committed to the role (he genuinely looks terribly ill) in almost every scene

Withnail is a coward while ""I"" really struggles with anxiety and outside the acting circle they'r both pretty much hopeless in life

But it's a tragic tale as Withnail isn't the one to get his big break as a leading man in some big production it's ""I"" instead

So Withnail is left reciting poetry to zoo animals in the pouring rain while his friend starts his big adventure in the acting world ...I liked the movie so much but the unexpected ending almost had me filling up with sorrow

movies,1jivkkv,The Monkey & the generational curse of your father's unresolved issues,"Just saw The Monkey last night and thoroughly enjoyed it! As always after seeing a movie I came to reddit to read a bunch of discussion threads and see what folks are saying. Lots of people talked about enjoying the campy kills and dialogue. Turning into pink mist from being electrocuted but your leg somehow flies off and smacks Theo James? ""It is what it is...the word of our Lord."" Good stuff! What I haven't seen as much talk about is the meaning of the film. Maybe it's been posted about already and I just haven't seen it, but I got the impression some viewers were unhappy with the lack of lore for the monkey-demon itself. I thought there was a clear and neatly-resolved message inside the delightfully silly package so I thought I'd add my two cents review.

To me the monkey represents the emotional burden of men, especially fathers\*, who repress their traumas, become stunted, and end up hurting those around them. The film shows us this harm to others on two parallel levels: the realistically fucked up relationship of an emotionally distant dad and his son, and the fantastically gruesome harm perpetrated by the monkey.

\*Of course the message works for anyone but I think fatherhood and masculinity is the most explicit. All four characters involved in the struggle over the monkey are men with dad issues. The main antagonistic relationships are dad-son, brother-brother, dad-step dad. Elijah Wood's foil to the main character is literally a ""fatherhood expert.""

Hal and Bill both become a type of man in this vein: Hal emotionally repressed and distant, Bill physically violent. In real life a man like Bill wouldn't need magic monkey powers to kill people over his emotions. Family violence is a common tragedy, and at least in part this is because a patriarchal society demands men repress their emotions and become islands unto themselves (""she was my mom too"" ""I never thought of it that way""). The monkey kills people around the brothers because there is an evil generational curse on them, but it's only a magic one for film reasons. The real generational curse is that emotionally unavailable fathers wreak havoc on people, especially their sons.

The movie resolves when the brothers open up to each other and Hal confronts death (literally) along with his feelings of guilt, shame, and fear. By doing this in front of his son he's choosing to deal with his emotions in a healthy way and end the vicious cycle. Likewise about the monkey he says they have to ""recognize that it's ours and keep it close"" so it can do further harm. The evil bastard monkey was the emotions we repressed all along!

For me it was exactly what I wanted it to be: enjoyably campy and dumb in the best way, but with an actual message buried in the tomfoolery. Watching it with this in mind made me enjoy the movie more and also made the ending feel quite satisfying.

Freaky

Keeping Mum

Going in Style

Some Like it Hot

My Favorite Brunette

Road to Bali

Kung Fu Panda

Groundhog Day

Death Becomes Her

My Favorite Martian

Plains Trains and Automobiles

Yes man

Ghost town

Even almighty

Tucker and Dale VS Evil

What We Do In The Shadows (TV series, the movie was ok)

Clue

I DONT like comedy's that rely on a lot of shock, nudity or gross out humour such as as Movie 54.

I'm not a fan of comedy movies that have a focus on relationships BUT if there is a big element of humor such as Even Almighty I'm cool with it.

I also like dark comedy but again it has to have a lot of humor such as Groundhog day.

I'm good with comedy movies that have a lot of gore in such as Tucker and Dale vs Evil, Ready or Not and Freaky.

I'm good with slapstick humor such as Pink Panther 2006, Death Becomes Her and Plains Trains and Automobiles.

Please help me find more comedy movies (and no spoilers please!), if you have any questions I'd be happy to answer.

Edit: I also liked
Hot Fuzz but not Shaun of The Dead or Worlds End

Monty Python and The Holy Grail

Stan VS Evil

They manage to survive the initial bombing, but what follows is even more tragic , as radiation sickness sets in and food becomes scarce, they slowly grow weaker and weaker.

What hit me the most was how they still held on to hope, believing the government would come to help...even in their final moments. That part was heartbreaking.

The animation is quite simple overall, but there are scenes...especially the one where the bomb hits , that were absolutely terrifying and brilliantly done. The destruction of the city, the trains, bridges, and homes...it felt like watching a storm rip through everything. I’m not exaggerating, that whole sequence genuinely scared me. It was intense.

I also liked how the husband remained optimistic through it all. He tried to keep things together, clinging to hope, comforting his wife, and trusting the system till the very end.

To me, this movie is about how ordinary people place blind trust in their government ,doing everything they're told ...while those in power make some decisions that leave civilians to suffer the consequences.

I won’t say it hit me as hard as Grave of the Fireflies, maybe because of the animation style or tone, but the quiet sadness in this movie... it lingers. It really does. Watching an old couple slowly fade away, still praying and holding on to faith ...that broke me all over again.

It’s not a movie I’d easily recommend for fun, but it’s one I think more people should watch. Especially in times like these.",36,0.7,31,2025-04-12 20:09:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jxq7al/after_grave_of_the_fireflies_i_watched_when_the/,Kudoshinichi0007

movies,1jtxz8d,just finished babylon and i loved it.,"First time writing a review, pls ignore grammar mistakes.

I absolutely loved the movie, especially the character of FL and Brad Pitt. Both represent the industry way too well, especially the downward spiral. The ending was super well, to me it was super relatable. The desire to be great-to be just be so great that people will remember you even after 100 years. 

  
The ending to me was such- Neille and Manny wanted to be part of something great, something bigger than human life. This was their connection. For Manny, the dream ended because he chose to get away from the screen, or to put it better, found satisfaction off-screen. Manny, on the other hand, found herself in the spotlight. Her character was obsessed with attention. She, too, wanted greatness. When watching the film, Manny realized that while Neille might have died at 32, but was still alive in people's memories, so was Jack (Brad Pitt) He remember his words-maybe felt regret but this filmns throws light on many things- To move on, Cycle of life, and also the price of greatness.",40,0.75,24,2025-04-07 22:17:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jtxz8d/just_finished_babylon_and_i_loved_it/,darkexplorer666
movies,1jsz77i,What are your thoughts on George C. Scott?,"Question, What are your thoughts on George C. Scott?

I've been on a binge of watching George C. Scott movies & show and I must say, George C. Scott really is a great actor. He has such a commanding presence when he is on screen, but he also manages to give such a vulnerable side to what character he plays. To me his best roles are Dr. Strangelove & Patton. Dr. Strangelove, for the sheer fact that he (& Also Slim Pickens) managed to outplay Peter Sellers and Patton, which is just a great performance and I consider it the best role he has ever played. He also deliver great performances in Anatomy Of A Muder, The Hustler, The Bible, The Hospital, Hardcore, The Changeling, A Christmas Carol.

I will say though, while George C. Scott is a great actor, some of the films he is in are probably not so great, which is why I think his film career stalled after the 70s, with films like The Last Run, Rage, The Day Of The Dolphin, Bank Shot, The Savage Is Loose, Island In The Streams, & The Formula being very mid, but saved by Scott. I also read that Scott turned down lead roles in In The Heat Of The Night, McCabe & Mrs. Miller, The Cowboys, The Godfather, Deliverance, Network, The Shootist.

However, what impresses me with Scott is that he managed to juggle both his film career and television career, which was a little frowned upon when trying to make a successful film career.

But all in all, What are your thoughts on George C. Scott?",36,0.74,88,2025-04-06 17:17:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jsz77i/what_are_your_thoughts_on_george_c_scott/,FreshmenMan

All that being said, the score of the sharks theme is also spine tingling and eerie, and it could have gone on to have a good sequel if they would have kept the graphics and effects what they were (we won't discuss DBS2 here) Honestly it had its flaws, what movie doesn't, but I'm genuinely curious, Deep Blue Sea, bad movie?

Only saw them when they were on TV earlier but I didn't hold them in very high regard maybe because I was younger. I was blown away how good these films are now. Did Hollywood forget how to make fun adventure films? Angelina Jolie is perfect in the role, couldn't ask for a better actress as Lara. She put in the work and it shows in the stunts. The pacing is breakneck which I feel is lacking in movies these days. How good was Daniel Craig in his pre-Bond role!

The sequel is even better and Roger Ebert was a fan of it while most critics disliked it then. It doubles the action, the locations and Angelina kicks even more ass. The look is stylized and it works. Some scenes feel straight from the games.

movies,1jkty5x,The birds [1963]. I have seen this movie more than I've seen my own father.,"This movie is perfect, to me. 

The movie aged well. I love how the actual plot of the birds is very much happening in the background for half of the movie until it is thrust in the forefront. The movie allows you to get to know Melanie, so you understand and care about her. I know some people say the first half drags, but I love how it is its own fun romantic movie before the tragedy sets in. The plot is scary, and I appreciate the feeling of doom. And I like how all the relationships between all the characters have depth. 

The dinner scene where they are debating if birds can attack is perfect. The way everyone reacts and plays off everyone else is amazing. I love the contrast of the hysterical mother with the overly logical bird expert. 

To be honest I have a huge crush on both leads. Melanie is a strong, wild, and clever woman. Mitch is clever, strong, and a gentleman. Both are insanely attractive. They have serious chemistry and the way they match each other in wit is awesome. It is extremely charming. 

Overall, 10/10. I watch it every time I get sick, and it always feels like a privilege. I have seen this movie 50+ times. ",38,0.8,12,2025-03-27 02:41:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jkty5x/the_birds_1963_i_have_seen_this_movie_more_than/,ThrowRA-Hanshotfirst

movies,1jiyzql,"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954)","I love this movie. After rewatching it I was reminded at how well made and beautiful everything is. The special effects still hold up tremendously today, despite being over 70 years old now. The physical sets of the Nautilus are outstanding, as are the miniatures used for exterior shots of it. Speaking of which, everything done underwater is mesmerizing and the effort and stuntwork required to get such shots is highly praiseworthy. Let's of course not forget the amazing squid attack sequence which is some of the best practical puppetry I've seen. And the plot too, I find to be a brilliant mix of character conflict and thrilling adventure of discovery. The discussions held between Captain Nemo, Ned, Pierre, and Conseil  about the ethics of humanity and our usage of warfar are genuinely fascinating and not just a black and white topic. All thanks to the performances from everyone on the cast. And lastly, the real oceanic filming locations are another big positive I admire as it truly makes you feel like you're going on this grand voyage to various exotic destinations. 

That all being said, this movie doesn't seem to be boasted about too highly in terms of classic cinema, apart from just having a good Rotten Tomatoes score. I rarely ever hear it even being mentioned. So I honestly wish more would watch 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea for it to have a resurgence of appreciation in today's modern discussion of film. Because it 100% deserves recognition for its stellar filmmaking and writing on display.

movies,1k5ljc8,We need to talk about kevin,"So…I finally decided to watch We Need to Talk About Kevin. After finishing the movie, I came straight here to see what people had to say about the ending and the film overall. One question that keeps coming up is: Why didn’t Kevin kill his mother?

A lot of people interpret it as Kevin wanting to punish her or provoke a reaction—and while I agree with that interpretation to some extent, I have a different take I’d like to share.

I think Kevin didn’t kill his mother because doing so would’ve given his actions a clear motive. Let me explain.

There’s a scene where his mother asks him why he collects those “crash CDs,” and he replies: “There is no point. That’s the point.” That line really stuck with me. It shows that Kevin is fascinated by meaningless things—things that have no purpose.

Which brings me to my theory: he killed his father, sister, and classmates because there was no reason to. His father was kind to him, his sister was just a child, and the classmates didn’t really do anything to him. There was no personal vendetta. And in Kevin’s twisted worldview at the time, that lack of meaning made it worth doing.

But killing his mother? That would have made sense. That would have had a clear motive:revenge, hatred, resentment. And that’s exactly why he didn’t do it.

At the end of the movie, when she asks him “Why?”, he says, “I used to think I knew. Now I’m not so sure.” To me, that shows he’s grown out of that phase of finding meaning in meaninglessness, and now he’s left with confusion and regret, or at least uncertainty.

This was basically the first performance where an actor gained a lot of weight for the role which inspired many other actors to do the same thing to this day. His performance is raw, unfiltered, angry, and completely believable as Jake LaMotta. This performance is right up there with Brando in The Godfather and Daniel Day Lewis in There Will Be Blood. This film is just a perfect character study of a violent guy slowly destroying his own life professionally and personally. The black and white was perfect for this film as well, it almost made the boxing scenes feel more vicious in a weird way. The scene in jail where he’s punching the wall and crying and screaming is some of the finest acting you could ever see.

I was absolutely blown away by the visuals as well as the acting by the main character Rohan Chand (at just 14 years old).  I was shocked to find out it was made in 2018, I feel like the visuals are above and beyond much of what I see from movies made today in 2025. And while the main character is a very young actor, he stays in character amazingly well and his facial expressions and delivery of his (sparing) lines is a above and beyond what I'd ever normally expect from an actor that age. 

Of course there was massive departure from the ""original"" story, but that didn't bother me at all, it's its own story and adaptation and I felt they pulled it off masterfully. 

The only thing I can assume from reading the prevalence of bad reviews is that people are pissed that it didn't do justice to their nostalgia for the ""original(s)"". 

The few reviewers who mentioned uncanny valley also baffle me.  I'm as adverse as the next guy to poorly animated humans and other creatures who speak, but I felt none of that in Mowgli. The animals with speech were remarkably believable and relatable. 

I searched and read threads on reddit from just after it came out, and most seemed to share the same criticisms as the critics, but I'm curious if that is still the consensus?

Those who loved, and loathed, this wonderful movie, I'm looking forward to hearing your opinions. ",29,0.63,13,2025-03-26 04:32:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jk3qie/mowgli_legend_of_the_jungle_2018_i_cant_believe/,jawanda
movies,1k0d8w3,Bedazzled (2000),"Who here has seen this one? I think it's excellent! Brendan Frazer does an amazing acting job as always, as does Elizabeth Hurley as the Devil, not to mention that she was drop-dead gorgeous! This is a remake of a movie from 1967 with the same title, starring Dudley Moore and Peter Cook, who played the Devil in that one. The original is also quite good, but I'd say not as good as the remake, though they're pretty much the same story, i.e., a pathetic nobody gets offered seven wishes from the Devil in exchange for their soul, but the Devil makes all their wishes go bad, though at the end, everything works out for both innocent characters (no spoilers here!) to the detriment of the Devil, who needs to look for another soul.

One thing I prefer about the remake, besides the Devil being played by a very hot woman, is that I thought it was quite thought-provoking concerning good, evil, and what really matters in life. Although I'm not religious and I don't believe in the Devil, at least not literally, I do believe in good and evil and I think we all face a battle between them, and ultimately we all need to decide which path to take and what really matters in our lives, which is what I think both movies are trying to say, but I think the 2000 remake says it better.",32,0.78,30,2025-04-16 05:51:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1k0d8w3/bedazzled_2000/,dcterr

movies,1jyifg5,Waterworld,"This is a crazy movie. It had the most expensive production at roughly $175 mil in 1994 and was a box office flop.
It would ultimately become profitable via tv and  cable distribution and with movie rentals and purchases.

Is it a bad movie? It depends on your perspective. I like it as a guilty pleasure movie. It’s flawed and nearly drowns under Costner’s ego, but it is entertaining.

If you like Mad Max or the Road Warrior type of action movies, you will enjoy this. Waterworld is basically the same thing, but on water.

Motorcycles are replaced with jet skis and boats.

This movie also features Dennis Hopper as the main bad guy and leader of the “Smokers”

Kevin Costner almost died during production via an accident while filming a scene in open water.
