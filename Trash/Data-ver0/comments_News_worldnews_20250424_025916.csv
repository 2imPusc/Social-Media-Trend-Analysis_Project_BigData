Ireland is the latest European country moving to update their travel advice for the United States for its citizens traveling to the country.

Ireland's government website issued an update to its transgender citizens, which stated, ""ESTA and visa application forms to the US require travelers to declare their sex. The US authorities have indicated that this should reflect the traveler's biological sex at birth. Travellers who have an ""X"" marker on their passport or whose sex on their passport differs from sex assigned at birth should contact the Embassy of the United States of America in Dublin for further details on specific entry requirements.""

worldnews,1jso3db,mlnwf36,"**From The Telegraph:**

Russian sensors suspected of trying to spy on British nuclear submarines are reported to have been found hidden in the seas around the UK.

The British military made the discovery after a number of them washed ashore and were located by the Royal Navy. They are being seen as a potential threat to national security.

The situation has not previously been made public but it has been reported in The Sunday Times that Moscow was looking to try and collect intelligence on the UK’s four Vanguard submarines, which carry nuclear missiles.

At least one of the submarines is at sea as part of Britain’s continuous at-sea deterrent.

Moscow has a fleet of specialist submarines which are reported to be better equipped than Britain and its Nato allies in terms of both seabed warfare and espionage.

Throughout the conflict with Ukraine, Russia has been stepping up surveillance and sabotage of underwater internet connections, energy pipelines and military cables, which are key to the West.

In 15 months, there have been at least 11 internet cables that have suffered damage in the Baltic Sea, partly because anchors have been dragged across the seabed by ships.

“You really need to keep the \[engine\] power on to drag, so it is a deliberate act,” a defence insider said.

Nordic Warden, a reaction system that uses AI to track the whereabouts of the Russian shadow fleet, was triggered by the UK-led Joint Expeditionary Force when a cable between Estonia and Finland was damaged in December.

A senior serving British military figure added: “There should be no doubt, there is a war raging in the Atlantic. This is a game of cat and mouse that has continued since the ending of the Cold War, and is now heating up again. We are seeing phenomenal amounts of Russian activity.”

The so-called “private” trip to Greenland apparently included a PR stunt in a private home – but not a single canvassed residence agreed to participate in this event, nor host it. How embarrassing for the US.

Translation of short article:

‘Representatives of the US Government canvassed vast parts of Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, ahead of the now cancelled visit from US Second Lady Usha Vance, says TV2 correspondent Jesper Steinmetz. Quote:

* Over the past few days american representatives have moved around the city knocking on one door after the other to ask whether the residents would like a visit from The Second Lady. Each time the answer has been a resounding “No, but thank you,” says Steinmetz.
* And this is the reason the US delegation’s  plans were changed, he finishes.‘

worldnews,1jzlccx,mn713ts,"**From The Telegraph:**

Two Chinese citizens captured fighting against Ukraine said they were “fed lies” by Russia and that Vladimir Putin’s forces were not as strong as they claimed.

Wang Guanjung and Zhang Renbo were captured fighting for Russia in eastern Ukraine earlier this month.

Handcuffed and wearing military fatigues at a briefing organised by Ukrinform, the Ukrainian national news agency, the pair said: “All Russia fed us are lies. They’re fake. Russia isn’t as strong as they claim, and Ukraine isn’t as backwards as they say.”

President Zelensky initially demanded that Beijing explain why Chinese soldiers, as he referred to them, were fighting for Russia.

The pair stressed, however, that they were not fighting on behalf of China and had no links to Chinese state authorities. Instead, they were recruited as mercenaries through online advertisements, they said.

Mr Wang said he was recruited through a TikTok advert. He told reporters he then travelled via coaches and minibuses to Kazan in south-west Russia, before moving through Rostov-on-Don before entering eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk region, where he enlisted in the army with Mr Zhang.

Mr Zhang told reporters he was in Russia as a tourist when he spotted an advert with the offer of two million roubles (£18,400) and decided to enlist.

The pair were both captured in Donetsk, with footage of their detention released on April 8.

Both prisoners said they were taken captive immediately after arriving on the front line and had not killed any Ukrainian troops.

Speaking a day after it was revealed that a journalist was accidentally included in a group chat discussing airstrikes against Yemeni rebels, Carney said the intelligence blunder was a “serious, serious issue and all lessons must be taken”. He said it would be critical to see “how people react to those mistakes and how they tighten them up”.

Canada is one of the members of the Five Eyes intelligence sharing network, alongside Australia, New Zealand and the UK and the leak of classified information is likely to put further strain on the group as it weighs how seriously the current American administration takes the handling of top secret information.

The revelations came as Canada grapples with a rapidly deteriorating relationship with the United States, its largest trading partner and closest military ally.

Wouldn't companies which have a supply chain entirely outside the US have a benefit as of this moment? As long as your supply chain is outside the US, then you can just trade between the countries within your own supply chain and basically sell it as normal to all countries, except for the US.

The biggest problem is when a part of your supply chain is in the US. This means that you will have to pay tariffs to get parts into the US and then additional tariffs when exporting the final product to a country that now has tariffs on the US too (now with 25% to Europe).

The US is a very large consumer, so a large part of your customers for your business will disappear, but to me it seems that the US (as a country) will feel the brunt of this tariff war first. The US, a next-level consumer economy, has to survive a ridiculous amount of time before the other countries will face the same impact as they are.

So either your company has to have its complete supply chain in the US (which is impossible) or you need to have a supply chain that exists completely outside the US (more likely).

It's frustrating because the whole ""make it in America or pay the price"" approach sounds great on paper, but in reality, it just means we pay more for the same stuff. And with inflation still a concern, this could hit lower and middle-income folks the hardest.



What’s worse is it risks a trade war. The EU is already prepping retaliatory tariffs, which means even more price hikes and potential disruption to industries that rely on international supply chains—like cars, construction, and heavy machinery.

In partnership with the country's leading business group, the Consejo Coordinador Empresarial (CCE), the government introduced ""México te abraza"" (""Mexico embraces you""), an initiative aimed at connecting deported Mexicans with immediate job opportunities.

The CCE announced that over 220 companies have made 63,880 job vacancies available through the Conexión Empresarial Paisano platform, as[ Mexico's Síntesis Digital reports](https://sintesis.com.mx/2025/04/15/empresas-mexicanas-empleos/). These positions are spread across all 32 states in Mexico. Nuevo León leads the country with 9,401 job openings, followed by Mexico City with 7,206 and the State of Mexico with 4,840. Other states, including Jalisco and Guanajuato, also feature prominently in the distribution of vacancies.

The initiative builds on a commitment made in January to provide at least 50,000 jobs to those returning from the United States. ""Mexico wants them to know they are welcome and that they can find dignified, well-paying work,"" said Francisco Cervantes Díaz, president of the CCE, to Síntesis.""

worldnews,1k2zdrq,mnz1573,"If only.

Mexican here. As much as I despise the Orange wannabe Emperor, and I would be glad that Mexico would have good countermeasures available for his bullying, I have to say that this looks just as a smokescreen by the Mexican government.

Most of those jobs that are being “available” were like that before. The mitigation of this problem is not as simple as the politicians want it to appear.

Over several decades, the Mexican governments (from all colors and ideologies) have abandoned the rural regions to whatever fate gets them, concentrating any efforts in cities, where most of the population lives. In those rural areas, people have made the conclusion that working the fields won’t give them enough to have a half decent life, so most of the young population emigrated to the US -yes, most of the time via illegal ways-. The numbers are so big (millions) that this workforce constitutes the primary source of hard currency for Mexico. Given the disparity in exchange, most of the time the people that have worked in the US and come back to Mexico DON’T want to have any job that pays in pesos. This creates all kinds of distortions in the economy, mainly diluting the earnings that these people got working in the US under often really bad conditions.

This immense illegal workforce has been used and abused by politicians at BOTH sides of the border. In the US, most of them work either in areas that can’t operate or have a significant reduction during winter (agriculture, construction, restaurants, hotels) and/or where working conditions are pretty horrible (meat packing). In Mexico, the money they send to their relatives is injected to the economy and provides a relief valve to a severe poverty problem.

The abuse continues now, with the Orange Turd playing a game as old as politics (“look at that guy that is not from this land, he is the one guilty of all the problems!”), and Mexican politicians pretending to “protect our migrants” while ignoring (or whitewashing) the multiple causes of a complex problem.",254,2025-04-19 19:11:59,MarvinTraveler

He’s unlikely to get on the ballot.

Should he get on the ballot, he’s unlikely to win because we use instant-runoff for Presidential elections (i.e. he would need transfer votes) and he would be transfer toxic.

In the unlikely scenario he clears those barriers, the President of Ireland cannot leave the State without permission of government. Do you really think McGregor wants to be locked in Ireland for 7 years?

And this isn’t some sort of “yeah but he’ll change the rules when he gets in” thing. He won’t. Unlike the US, Ireland hasn’t spent the last century gradually ceding executive power to the Presidency. In Ireland, it’s an important constitutional role but with vanishingly few reserved powers. There would be no reason for the government of Ireland - consistently made up of European-style centrists since the foundation of the State - to listen to him. Ireland uses proportional representation which means the government is pretty much never going to be more than centre-right or centre-left so a takeover by the alt-right is essentially impossible.",121,2025-04-01 08:22:33,HumoursOfDonnybrook

worldnews,1jmun6n,mkemvid,"Ukrainian forces have responded to Russian efforts to expel them from one part of Russian territory by launching a large number of attacks on another border area, using drones, artillery and troops.

More than 20 villages in Russia’s Belgorod region – which are located in a 150-kilometer (90-mile) stretch of land along the Ukrainian border – have come under attack, according to the region’s governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov. The Ukrainian military has not officially acknowledged the operation.

It is unclear whether the Ukrainian attacks in Belgorod are intended to take and hold Russian soil, or whether the move is an effort to relieve pressure on Ukrainian troops still in the Kursk area and in the adjoining Ukrainian region of Sumy by forcing a redeployment of Russian forces.

The extent of Ukraine’s success so far in Belgorod is unclear. Unofficial Russian sources speak of a Ukrainian presence several kilometers inside Russia.

Putins price - which I’m sure is out in the open in the secret negotiations between US and RUS - is to have safe conduct in Ukraine and probably other european countries.

And the outcome is weakening historic western alliances - a dream scenario for Putin. Putin is playing Trump and Trump has no clue. He will destabilize the western world and Putin is the only winner.

Hopefully the unforeseen consequences will be a revitalized EU that will rearm and find a way to replace Nato and have a more unitary chain of command.

And Trump is underestimating the negative impact breaking up old alliances will have on the US economy. The anger in EU by both its leaders and its citizens is massive. The majority will choose not to buy US products and countries don’t want to trade with someone they can’t trust.

- become a puppet state of Russia and face genocide
- become a colony of Murica where everything of value is being routed abroad

Military chiefs at Nato have been warned of global internet blackouts following a string of suspected [Russian attacks on subsea cables](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/11/30/undersea-cables-leave-britain-exposed-russia-china/).

Telecoms companies including Vodafone, O2 owner Telefonica and Orange have written to UK, EU and Nato officials warning that a rise in sabotage incidents was [putting critical services at risk](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/01/16/undersea-submarine-cable-cut-grey-war-dark-fleet/).

In an open letter, they wrote: “The repercussions of damage to subsea cables extend far beyond Europe, potentially affecting global internet and power infrastructure, international communications, financial transactions and critical services worldwide.”

It comes after a spike in incidents relating to fibre optic cables on seabeds that carry huge volumes of data, voice and internet traffic between countries.

It's not a huge leap to conclude that the US, or one of their allies in the region, cut the cables to get access to Iraqi internet chatter. It also just happened to be in the months leading up to GWB's secret trip to Iraq.

Britain is backing plans for a Nuremberg-style trial of Vladimir Putin in the face of opposition from Donald Trump.

The UK will support proposals at the Council of Europe next month calling for Russians to be prosecuted for “crimes of aggression” during the invasion of Ukraine.

The idea would involve setting up a military tribunal, modelled on the Nazi trials after the Second World War, to prosecute Russian leaders and generals for war crimes.

Some lawyers, including Sir Keir Starmer’s long-time friend Philippe Sands, have suggested the ad hoc court should be established specifically to deal with crimes of aggression, which are defined by the United Nations as “invasion or attack by the armed forces of a state on the territory of another state, or any military occupation”.

Some Western countries, including the UK, have said that Russians should be tried on those grounds for the political decision to invade, not only for war crimes committed on Ukrainian soil once the war began.

The International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Hague cannot examine the “crime of aggression”, and is not recognised by either Russia or the US.

The plan for a new court to examine crimes of aggression was first suggested in 2022. It was backed by the Ukrainian government and Joe Biden’s administration, which sent funding and American prosecutors to help set it up.

However, Donald Trump withdrew all US involvement in the plan after his inauguration in January, as part of his strategy to be more conciliatory towards Moscow.

The president has refused to refer to the war in Ukraine as an “invasion” by Russia, and hopes to act as a peace broker between Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president.

Away from the border, law enforcement officials need a search warrant to look through someone's phone or laptop. But U.S. Border Patrol officers can look through a mobile phone, check comments made on social media and examine a laptop without a warrant. They can also take devices or download all of their contents.

An immigration lawyer and a privacy lawyer said travellers who are concerned about their privacy should understand border patrol officers' powers and decide how much risk they're comfortable taking before they leave home. Two of the experts suggested travelling with a burner phone and leaving their actual phones at home.

""What they should be scanning for is evidence that someone is going to commit a crime or violate the terms of their entry visa. **But once the officer is noodling around inside the phone, you know that there's a risk they're going to go beyond that. And as you say, they might just be looking at someone who says, 'I am angry at the president of the United States' or 'I'm proud to be Canadian and it makes me mad that the United States has just imposed tariffs on us or whatever it is,"" Schwartz said.**

The Chinese owners said they couldn’t afford the raw materials needed to operate it, the British government offered to buy the materials for the company, the company apparently refused this and demanded the government give them the money instead of the materials, while the government were scratching their heads over why the Chinese company were refusing what was basically free raw materials they learned that the company was deliberately placing orders for raw materials then refusing to pay for them or cancelling the contracts at the last minute which would result in the factory having no materials and the furnaces then cooling down, once cooled down the furnaces are expensive to reignite and would make the plant completely unviable to ever reopen so China would close the plant and offer steel from its own plants to fulfill orders

The government and workers considered this a deliberate sabotage effort on the part of the owners and that’s why they moved to seize the plant

The serious nature of this all is best shown with part 4(3A) of the act passed which authorised the use of force to enter and seize the plant if any individual tried to stop the government taking control or appeared to be moving to impede its operations",2412,2025-04-12 22:18:32,Hellstorm901

So on Earth this is mainly created by life… but that doesn’t mean it is on exoplanets, and in fact the lead authors explain this carefully. 

I think it’s very important to remember that most scientific discoveries are not immediate slam dunks, but rather happen with intermediate steps. Think about water on Mars as an example- I remember when they first found proof that there might have been water on Mars but it wasn’t conclusive, then they found better and more signatures, then evidence there used to be oceans… and today everyone agrees there’s water on Mars. 

Similarly, if looking for these signatures, the first are not conclusive because there are alternate possibilities still. But then you find a little more, and even more… and before you know it we all agree there’s life elsewhere in the universe (though what puts it out there is far less clear).

As exciting as what Hollywood tells you it would be like? No- but still a cool discovery!

worldnews,1k0yeph,mnjp955,"About a year ago, the James Webb Space Telescope detected a possible signal of dimethyl sulfide in the atmosphere of K2-18b, although it wasn’t confirmed at the time. The planet itself is already highly intriguing – a “Hycean” super-Earth, likely covered by a vast global ocean beneath a thick hydrogen-rich atmosphere.

Now, a new research team reports detecting not just dimethyl sulfide, but also dimethyl disulfide and methane – all molecules strongly linked to biological activity on Earth.

If these detections are confirmed, it raises the exciting possibility that K2-18b’s oceans could host life. Not just simple microbes, but potentially more complex aquatic ecosystems. Life there might resemble deep-sea organisms on Earth: thriving in dark, high-pressure environments, drawing energy from chemical reactions rather than sunlight. Think dense microbial mats clustered around underwater chemical vents, or even filter-feeding organisms adapted to the thick, hydrogen-rich atmosphere that presses down on the water’s surface.

With a completely different atmospheric composition and ocean chemistry compared to Earth, life could have evolved along very different lines - perhaps using biochemistries we haven’t seen yet. If confirmed, it would be the first evidence not just of life beyond Earth, but of life thriving in a truly different kind of environment.

Russia’s stock market has suffered its worst week in more than two years in response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s sweeping global tariffs and a drop in global oil prices.

The market capitalization of companies listed on the Moscow Exchange (MOEX) fell by 2 trillion rubles ($23.7 billion) over just two days, sliding from 55.04 trillion rubles ($651.8 billion) at Wednesday’s close to 53.02 trillion ($627.9 billion) by the end of trading Friday, according to exchange data.

The MOEX Russia Index, which tracks 43 of Russia’s largest publicly traded companies, lost 8.05% over the week — its worst performance since late September 2022, when markets were rattled by the Kremlin’s announcement of mass mobilization for the war in Ukraine.

At the end of trading on Friday, shares in some of the country’s largest firms had plunged: Sberbank fell by 5.2%, Gazprom 4.9%, VTB 6%, Rosneft 3.9% and Lukoil 4.6%. Mechel, the steel and coal giant, dropped more than 7%, while flagship airline Aeroflot slid 4.8% and gas producer Novatek fell 5.4%.

However, the federal government has several roles to fulfill regarding health care, most prominently through the Canada Health Transfer.

This is an excerpt from the Liberal media release outlining their platform on Health Care:

* Add thousands of new doctors to Canada’s health care system, increase medical school spaces and build new medical schools, expand residency positions, recruit qualified doctors through a new global recruitment strategy and streamline credential recognition for internationally trained doctors and nurses;
* Build hospitals, clinics, and more, by investing $4 billion to construct and renovate community health care infrastructure including long-term care homes, and community clinics, and increase access to team-based care, mental health care services, and expensive machinery such as MRIs;
* Modernize Canada’s public healthcare system, including cutting wait times in half for life-saving medications, launching a Task Force for Public Health Care Innovation, implementing a national license for physicians and nurses, reducing the administrative burden on doctors, and securing Canadians’ access to their health care data;
* Improve mental health care and support to address the overdose crisis, including with an immediate $500 million investment in the Emergency Treatment Fund to confront the toxic drug and overdose crisis; and,
* Invest in women’s health, including ensuring there will always be funding for abortion care in Canada by making the Sexual and Reproductive Health Fund Program permanent and introducing a new in vitro fertilization (IVF) program to make it more affordable for Canadians who want to become parents.
* Protect reproductive rights, by always standing up for the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

*“In America, health care is big business – but in Canada, it is a right,”* said Mark Carney, Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada. *“Canada will never be America. We must protect and build the institutions that make us strong. My new government will invest in our public health care system to add thousands of new doctors, build new hospitals, and deliver better mental health services. We will build a stronger Canadian health care system.”*

I work in a large law firm. Last week we got a new policy on crossing the US border.

One part of the policy dealt with devices containing client confidential or privileged information. We aren’t to do it unless absolutely necessary, and in such cases, we must pass word protect and not provide the authorities with the password when asked. Lawyers have an ethical duty to clients to not put confidential or privileged client information at risk. 

We are to only cross at major airports that do pre clearance, and if the authorities insist on accessing devices, we are to turn back. 

Otherwise, the firm will issue scrubbed devices for travel. Supply is limited, so limit your travel to that necessary.

worldnews,1jzr13o,mn849hh,"**From The Telegraph:**

Serbia could be blocked from joining the European Union if its president travels to Russia next month for Vladimir Putin’s Victory Day parade.

Russian state media reported that Aleksandar Vucic would be one of the foreign dignitaries in attendance, as well as contributing military hardware to the spectacle on May 9.

In response, European officials warned Mr Vucic that his visit would be a breach of the bloc’s membership criteria and would derail his country’s EU ambitions.

“We need to ensure that they understand that certain decisions come at a cost,” said Jonatan Vseviov, the secretary-general of Estonia’s ministry of foreign affairs. “The consequence is them not joining the European Union.”

He added: “Russians have been working hard to get people to attend . . . For us this will be an important litmus test. Basically what we look at is whether or not they are on our side or playing on the other team.”

Kaja Kallas, the bloc’s top foreign diplomat, said EU foreign ministers had discussed prospective member states attending the ceremony in Moscow, at a gathering on Monday.

“What was also discussed very clearly, and said by different member states, is that any participation in the May 9 parades or celebrations in Moscow will not be taken lightly on the European side, considering that Russia is really waging a full-scale war in Europe,” she told reporters after the meeting.

Serbia has long attempted to simultaneously cultivate relations with Brussels and Moscow.

It applied to join the bloc in 2009, and was made a candidate for membership in 2012.

South Korea's military fired warning shots on Monday after approximately 10 North Korean soldiers crossed the heavily fortified border separating the two countries, officials said.

According to the South's Joint Chiefs of Staff, the North Korean troops retreated back across the Military Demarcation Line following loudspeaker warnings and a volley of warning gunfire. No further clashes were reported, but Seoul said it is maintaining heightened vigilance in response to what it called a ""serious provocation.""

worldnews,1ju9u5f,mm0k95s,">South Korea's military fired warning shots on Monday after approximately 10 North Korean soldiers crossed the heavily fortified border separating the two countries, officials said.

>According to the South's Joint Chiefs of Staff, the North Korean troops retreated back across the Military Demarcation Line following loudspeaker warnings and a volley of warning gunfire at around 5 p.m. local time. No further clashes were reported, but Seoul said it is maintaining heightened vigilance in response to what it called a ""serious provocation.""

>The incident comes amid a spike in tensions on the peninsula, as North Korea continues a series of weapons tests while ignoring diplomatic overtures from U.S. President Donald Trump. Since taking office on January 20, Trump has repeatedly stated his desire to restart talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Pyongyang, however, has remained silent, accusing Washington of intensifying hostile policies despite the change in administration.

>Why It Matters

>The incident underscores ongoing tensions on the Korean Peninsula, where high-level diplomatic efforts have stalled and military posturing has intensified. While similar border violations have occurred in the past—such as one in June 2024 that also prompted warning shots—they rarely result in direct conflict. The current intrusion comes amid heightened political instability in South Korea and continued provocations from the North.

>South Korea is navigating the fallout from the dramatic ouster of President Yoon Suk Yeol last week. Yoon was removed from office after his controversial decision to impose martial law in the wake of mass protests—a move that was widely condemned at home and abroad. The leadership vacuum in Seoul has further complicated the already fragile security situation on the Korean Peninsula.

>What To Know

>The Demilitarized Zone stretches 248 kilometers (155 miles) across the peninsula and is 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) wide. It remains one of the most fortified borders in the world, layered with barbed wire, land mines, tank traps, and combat units. The DMZ was established as part of the 1953 armistice that ended the Korean War, which never formally concluded with a peace treaty.

>Tuesday's incursion follows a pattern of similar low-level violations that have not escalated into major flashpoints. South Korean authorities have previously assessed such movements as accidental, especially in regions with dense vegetation and poor visibility of boundary markers. Last year's incident involved North Korean soldiers carrying construction tools, and officials at the time concluded there was no deliberate attempt to provoke confrontation.

>What People Are Saying

>The South Korean military did not attribute a motive to the North's movement but reaffirmed its readiness.

>""Our military issued warnings and fired warning shots, and the North Korean soldiers retreated,"" a South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff official told reporters.

>""We are closely observing the North's military status and taking necessary measures to plan our strategy.""

>South Korean political analysts suggested the North may be testing reaction times or unintentionally breaching the boundary due to ongoing construction or terrain challenges. However, no official comment has been released from Pyongyang.",60,2025-04-08 11:10:49,BubsyFanboy

> US and western intelligence officials do not believe that Russia is interested in negotiating a ceasefire deal with Ukraine in good faith, CNN has reported. Moscow still believes it can sustain its war effort and outlast Ukraine on the battlefield.

>A senior NATO official reiterated that on Thursday, saying that “Russia still believes that time mostly is on its side.”

>“We have had questions for a long time about whether Putin intends to negotiate in good faith,” the official said. Russia is “willing to continue those talks [about mending ties with the US] at the same time that it is delaying and stalling and saying that they can’t accept the US proposals right now, on the actual ceasefire. I think all of that supports the idea that Russia’s goals haven’t changed at all—that right now, what it is trying to do is probably stall for time, make less concessions on the war, and try to instead make progress on sanctions, on Russia’s place in the international community.”

Most of the French aid sent during the American Revolution was through loans, which were all repaid by 1795 - with great difficulty, due to the struggling American economy at the time.

But there was a portion of early French aid, delivered prior to the official alliance, which was always considered a donation. In 1796, France declared that early aid to have actually been a loan as well, and when the USA refused to accept that it needed to be repaid, France enabled privateers to seize American shipping in order to make up the ""debt"". When the USA tried to negotiate the issue peacefully, French government ministers insisted on being bribed before they would cooperate - the infamous XYZ Affair. 

This sparked the Quasi War, lasting from 1798-1800, which saw the USA rebuild a navy from scratch to go to war against France, defending American shipping by generally kicking French ships all around the Caribbean, and set the legal precedent that Congress can authorize military deployments without making an official declaration of war.
