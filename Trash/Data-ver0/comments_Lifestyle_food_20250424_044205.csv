food,1k27iwl,mnsj05j,Liangpi is my favorite cold dish from China. I also love their cousin the liangpi burrito (not sure what it’s called in Chinese).,7,2025-04-18 17:28:50,DivineFlamingo
food,1k27iwl,mntgha7,"For reference, 'cold skin' is just a translation for the name of the dish. Liangpi is made of fresh starch noodles (sometimes wheat).

It's topped with a spicy chili oil based sauce with soy sauce, black vinegar, Sichuan peppercorn, and garlic. Often served with cold julienned cucumber, cilantro, and wheat gluten.

It's served cold and it's the spicy salty sour cold noodle dish of your dreams. It's genuinely one of the best things you could eat on a hot day. 

You're immediately hit with the chewy cold noodles and crisp cucumber, followed by the refreshing tartness of the black vinegar first in that sauce, then the salty spicy of the soy and chili oil joins the mix. 

That's when the magic starts. 

The heat from the chili oil and the numbing sensation from the Sichuan peppercorn makes your mouth water and puts your tongue and nose into overdrive. 

The cold noodles and cucumber drives away the burning in your mouth, but you keep coming back for more in a vicious cycle of satisfying burning and delicious cooling.

Next thing you know you've finished the whole damn bowl, the front of your shirt (and immediate vicinity) is bright red from the oil splattering as you slurped, your eyes are watering, and your face is red. But somehow, you feel refreshed and satisfied.

* 6lbs boneless chicken thigh
* 1/2 cup soy sauce
* 1/2 cup ketchup
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 1/3 cup white wine
* 1 tbsp Worcestershire
* 2 tbsp minced garlic
* 2 tbsp minced ginger


Combine ingredients in sealable bag and marinate for 4 hours. Grill on high for about 15 min, then on inderect heat for another 10-15, brushing additional marinade and turning every 5-6 minutes. 


First time making this! Came out great, will definitely do again. I made a small bowl of extra marinade with some fresh pineapple and orange juice added for more brightness and tang, and used that to brush the chicken as it grilled. I'm aware pineapple is not inherently Hawaiian or normally included in Huli Huli, my two hours of research yesterday told me as much, but I like pineapple so I added some to the glaze.

food,1jsfv0w,mlm5k6z,"Recipe notes:

\- Had some chicken breast, and I love a good and easy (enough) cast iron meal

\- Thawed the chicken, salted it well, and racked it for a 6 hours in the fridge to dry.

\- Began heating up the cast iron as I chopped my veg (1 big stalk of celery, 1.5 medium onions, 6 mini sweet peppers, 2 cloves of garlic + tomato, as per photo)

\- Olive oil into the hot pan (on medium, medium low, banking on heat inertia), lay chicken down the the sear, fresh ground pepper on as it cooks. Did both sides, and set aside the breasts. Added the tomato in there to help with removing the skin later.

\- I deglazed the pan with some butter, added some flour to make a roux of the bottom of the pan. Added about 1 cup of chicken stock (half a cube in about a cup of water) and 1/2 cup of milk (all I had), let it come together, clear pan and set aside roux 1.

\- After clearing the pan, back onto the burner, turned up the heat a bit, dropped olive oil and then the garlic, fried off until becoming golden, dropped in rest of veg. A bit of salt. Skinned tomato, and added it into the veg, fried it off steadily, good pinch of thyme, a little extra pepper. I finished it with a little butter and a bit of flour and a touch of water to make a thin roux mixed into the veg, topped with a dash of vinegar and Worcestershire.

\- Combined roux 1 and veg-roux 2 in the pan, taste, seasoning is on point, dropped in the chicken breast, foiled the pan, and popped it in the oven at 325F for 45min, foil off for 30, and a little blast under the broiler.

Result: Insane gravy - so much depth of flavour. My roommate pulled out some instant mash, a bit sacrilege, but whatever, I was tired of cooking. Set the chicken on the mash, gravy all around. Pull-apart chicken goodness. Outrageously delicious meal.

edit: forgot a dash of vinegar and Worcestershire
edit 2: i admit there's something left to be desired for looks, but that's basically a sieve and some fancy legwork. The idea was to keep it to one pan.",8,2025-04-05 23:08:29,crimsontape

Main Ingredients


Pork Chops 500.0g


Garlic 10.0g


Ginger 10.0g


Onion 20.0g


Sesame Seeds 5.0g


Vegetable Oil 15.0ml


Seasonings
Soy Sauce 45.0ml


Mirin 30.0ml


Sake 30.0ml


Sugar 20.0g


Vegetable Oil 15.0ml


Cooking Steps
1: Finely mince the garlic and
ginger. Slice the onions thinly.


2: In a bowl, mix soy sauce,
mirin, and sake to make the
teriyaki sauce


3: Heat vegetable oil in a pan
over medium heat. Add the pork
chops and cook for 3-4 minutes
on each side until browned.


4: Remove the pork chops from
the pan and set aside. In the
same pan, add the minced
garlic ginger onion, sauté for 30
seconds until fragrant


5: Return the pork chops to
the pan and pour the teriyaki
sauce over them. Add sugar.
Simmer for 5-7 minutes, flipping
occasionally, until the sauce
thickens and coats the pork.


6: Garnish with sesame seeds
before serving.


Cooking Tips


Tip1 Marinate the pork chop at least
2 hours in teriyaki sauce to get
flavor in.


Tip2 Do not add sugar when you
marinate if you are the beginner.
Meat marinated with sugar could
get burned easily in searing.",6,2025-03-28 14:11:00,DamonLLLemon

food,1jzkfzy,mn6va2j,"Recipe is my own: https://theeuropeandish.com/traditional-lebanese-tabbouleh-tabouli/

Ingredients: 
1/2 cup fine bulgur wheat
4 cups fresh parsley, minced
2 tbsp. fresh mint, minced
2 small tomatoes, cut in cubes
4 tbsp. extra virgin olive oil
1 large lemon, juice and zest needed
2 small shallots, optional
water to cover bulgur with
sea salt and white pepper to taste

How to make it:
Prepare Bulgur: In a large mixing bowl add water (to triple cover bulgur) and squeezed fresh lemon juice.
Then, pour the bulgur wheat into the bowl and let soak for 30 minutes (or more if needed). Bulgur should become soft and double/triple in size*.
Drain bulgur wheat from excess water and set aside.
Prepare Salad: Chop parsley, mint and tomatoes finely (as well as shallots). Place into salad bowl and mix.
Assemble: Add bulgur to rest of the ingredients, season with lemon zest, olive oil, salt and pepper to taste. Keep in the fridge for 10-15 minutes and serve.",6,2025-04-15 05:52:32,Classic_Ad_7733

Add flour, sea salt, and some baking powder. Replace about 5 grams of flour with flavor powder (like tea powder or matcha). Use fresh milk to adjust the texture as needed. 
➡️ now, the cookie dough is done ✅ make it into a rectangular shape with at least 1 cm thickness, wrap it up and put it in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes to cool it down. 
Take the dough out and cut it into small pieces (3*3 cm and 1 cm thick here). Glaze with a mixture of yolk and honey. Put the cookies back in refrigerator for another 15-20 minutes. Glaze the top of cookies again. 
Preheat oven to 170 Celsius (340 Fahrenheit) and bake for approximately 19-20 minutes until golden brown.
