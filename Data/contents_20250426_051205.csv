1jzyr1y,reddit,[Homemade] Potato Terrine,"While it may be a little time consuming, it's still easy, so don't just be a spec-tater, this Potato Terrine is quite a-peeling! 🤣

Mix some heavy cream with salt, garlic powder, and grated parm then thinly slice (or use a mandolin) some potatoes and toss them in the mix.

Line a baking dish with parchment paper leaving enough over the edges to fold over the top and make a few layers of potato at the bottom. Drizzle with melted butter then repeat potato and butter until the pan is about half full. You can go higher if you want to make them bigger. Fold the parchment paper over the top, cover w/ tin foil and bake at tree fiddy until they're soft and tender.

Remove and let cool for about 15 minutes then use something heavy to press down on the top, a 5lb bag of flour worked perfect for me 😂 and chill in the fridge overnight.

The next day, slice and brown the cut sides in olive oil and you're H-O-T-P-O-T-A-T-O or whatever Chappelle Roan yells about...if you're serving as a side, trim the ends off and top with a scallion, I had these with some 420 garlic butter 😆

Also, the thinner frosting was indeed easier to handle. For those of you who saw my last post just add half the amount of milk as heavy cream to the frosting and it should be a manageable consistency. Instead of ¼ cup of cream, I went with ½ cup of cream and ¼ cup of milk. Although, after taking the frosting out of the fridge, it needed to thin out with more milk.

A simple but delicious recipe 😋. I missed Soju bar so I had to make it at home 😊.

Ingredients:
Marinate
- Ginger
- Salt and pepper
- Oil
- Mirin (optional)
- Potato starch

Sauce
- I used 1 tbsp. Gochujang depends on how spicy you want it to be. 
- I used 0,5 tbsp. Honey depends on how sweet you want it to be. 
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 1,5 tbsp soy sauce
- 2 to 4 garlic cloves

Garnish (Whatever you have left in the fridge
- Green onions
- Cilantro

Instructions
Marinate your chicken wings or drumsticks 2 hours before with ginger, salt, pepper and oil. (Mirin is optional)

After marinating, coat them with starch (potato or corn works fine).
Shake off the excess starch and fry them 2 times. Once for 3 to 5 min. The second time for 3 min.

Coat it in the sauce and toss it around in a bowl. Top it off with your garnish and there you have it! Your own korean fried chicken 🍗",2025-04-02 15:21:12,food,food,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,81,1,,0.98,https://i.redd.it/mkf2mb5mvfse1.jpeg,ViyVY

1jyi6lp,reddit,[Homemade] Beef Carpaccio roastbeef sandwiches,"(For 2 sandwiches)

Get your desired sandwich bread (I personally used Mediterranean bread that already has tea especially of salt and olive oil)

-butter it with the amount you like

-thinly slice half a tomato and add it to the bottom part of the sandwich (save the other half for later)

-thinly slice half of your desired fresh mozzarella cheese into thin slices (save the other half for later)

-spread some balsamic vinegar on the mozzarella

-add the carpaccio, 2-3 slices per sandwich and add a dash of lemon oil

-thinly slice half a avocado and add the slices on to of the carpaccio (save the other half for later) and light season the avocado with salt and lemon pepper

Close the sandwich

I usually use a panini maker when toasting them, but people have their own preferences

Once it's been toasted to your personal preferences the carpaccio will have turned into a lovely roastbeef inside the sandwich

Finally, use the leftover tomato, mozzarella and avocado to make a little side salad, either to go with the sandwiches or to eat later, if eating them later, add balsamic vinegar and lemon oil",2025-04-13 21:11:48,food,food,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,43,0,,0.91,https://i.redd.it/dvivt1z64oue1.jpeg,Kevin_Eats_Sushi
