travel,1jr7zgf,i went on a solo trip thinking i’d “find myself” or whatever… but instead i got drunk w a 73yo italian grandma & ended up in a village wedding??,"okay sooo this was not in the plan at all.

i booked a solo trip to italy cause i thought i needed one of those life changing moments ppl always talk about. packed my little backpack, journal, headphones with a sad girl playlist. i was READY to heal.

first day i was in naples and met this older lady (she was literally wearing a leopard dress and heels at 10am, queen energy). we started talking cause i helped her carry something, and somehow she invited me to her village outside the city for “real food and better wine”.

long story short: i said yes, she takes me on this sketchy but cute train, i meet her WHOLE family, everyone is yelling (but like the loving kind), i drink way too much homemade wine, and 6 hours later i’m dancing barefoot at a wedding for a couple i’ve never met in my life.

everyone was hugging me and calling me “bella ragazza” and i cried a lil cause it just felt so warm and… real. not like the curated tiktok travel stuff, just like life happening.

anyway. didn’t find myself but def found out that italian grandmas party harder than me lol. 10/10 would do again.",52526,0.92,1747,2025-04-04 09:42:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jr7zgf/i_went_on_a_solo_trip_thinking_id_find_myself_or/,FoxyEnchantingSimp
travel,1jrf8zn,First and Maybe Last Visit to India?,"I’ve only visited 18 countries and even though the historical buildings, architecture, and cuisine were incredible, I have little desire to return to India. 

As a fairly tall Black American male I stood out among everyone. I was grabbed often, all by men, stared at for an ungodly length of time, and just generally felt overwhelmed and uncomfortable there. The staring is next level. It’s not a glance. It’s a purposeful observation that continues indefinitely. At one point a man was looking at me from a few feet away. I moved to block his view then he moved to get closer to me to continue the gawking. 

The poverty is disturbing and the absurd amount of garbage is nightmare fuel for environmentalists. Locals don’t seem to care much about the cleanliness in the urban areas. Watched several people willingly throw trash into the street from apartments and train cars. Why do they do this?

On the other hand, the Taj Mahal is incredible. Easily the most fascinating part of our trip. We’ve been to 6 new world wonders, 7 if we include the Pyramids of Giza, and the TM is in my top 2 with Petra being the best. 

Walking through the gate and seeing the mausoleum in the background bathing in the morning light was like stepping into a fairy tale land. We loved it so much, we returned for a second day. There are rooftop bars and restaurants too with incredible views and inexpensive food and booze. 

My suggestion visiting India would be to ensure everything is private. Transportation, guides, etc. The logistics can be a pain so the peace of mind of having everything taken care of for you is worth the cost imo.

travel,1k1etvf,"Tokyo under cherry blossoms, Mar/Apr 2025","This was my first time visiting Tokyo, Japan, and a long time dream destination. I was lucky my visit coincided with the cherry blossom season! I did not plan the visit around it; I just so happened to notice quite a few flights flying through Tokyo on my way back from the Philippines that I decided to do a layover for … 2 weeks! It was when I reviewed my trip itinerary early this year that I learned cherry blossoms in Tokyo would start blooming the week I arrived!

Though there are many recommended places to view cherry blossoms (one of which was Ueno Park), I find those places to be easily overwhelmed with crowds and become less enjoyable. I found cherry blossoms to be ubiquitous in the city. You could easily find a small park, a shrine, a temple, a museum, a gallery, or a hidden street with lots of cherry blossoms and no crowds, and have the view all to yourself without interruption.

The only downside to this visit was that half of the time it rained pretty hard! Yet, even with the rain, the cherry blossoms still looked beautiful and gave a nice touch of colour to the greyness, and the city itself looked different, in a good way, under the rain.

Despite its geographic and population size, I do find Tokyo overall to be quiet. Indeed, places like Shibuya, Shinjuku, Harajuku, Ginza, Akihabara, and Asakusa can be (very) loud, but I found when you turn a corner to a residential area or empty street, it becomes quiet as if you were far away from all the action. As well, the city is clean. I only saw littering at tourist spots, but it was very minimal. Even the garbage trucks I saw were quite pristine and odorless!

Its renowned public transportation system lived up to its reputation. It was easy to get around the city with the subway and trains, though I got lost multiple times in stations like Shibuya, Ueno, and Tokyo. I also found Tokyo to be a walkable city, with a lot of sidewalks for pedestrians and minimal traffic. Maybe this is a result of a public transportation system where people don’t rely on cars (and hence less noise pollution)? Speaking of cars, people are very safe and good drivers.

Like many people on here have mentioned, I highly recommend Tokyo! I’m already planning to visit again in a few years, as well as other cities. I can go on about other things, but I’d love to hear other people’s travel experience, stories, and recommendations in Tokyo!",5161,0.99,91,2025-04-17 14:56:13,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k1etvf,shense

travel,1jrepvf,"My trip to Antarctica: icebergs, penguins, sleeping on the ice etc.","Hi everyone, I want to share with you a few pictures and feelings from my journey to Antarctica last autumn. 

Icebergs, penguins, orcas, seals, landings, sleeping on the snow of the 7th continent – the trip had it all. I decided that if any of my travels is worth sharing, this is the one.

It’s my first ever post on Reddit so please let me know if I messed up somehow so I could do better next time.

##Setting Sail from Ushuaia

On Nov 24th I boarded the World Explorer in Ushuaia with 160 fellow travelers for a 10-day Antarctic expedition with Quark Expeditions. $10 000 didn’t get me a private cabin, so I shared a room with Akira-san from Japan. We were perfect roommates: he spent his time at the bar while I rested in the cabin, and our shower schedules never overlapped. An introvert’s dream.

The passengers and crew came from all over: Canada, Australia, Europe, my new buddies from the US, and beyond. It was fascinating to connect with people from so many different backgrounds, accents, and stories. 10 days on a ship with no internet really boost communication skills. 

Safety was a priority, starting with a mandatory drill. The ship had a small shop selling warm clothing for those who forgot essentials, a lecture hall, and a restaurant. One of the top decks featured an enclosed observation deck where we could watch the scenery with a drink in hand, or step outside for an unobstructed view. That’s also where we gathered for a toast at the end of the journey. 

Beyond the enclosed lounge, the open decks at the bow and stern offered incredible views. The bow was off-limits at high speeds, but the stern remained accessible. The real adventure, though, began in the mudroom, where we suited up in waterproof boots and life jackets before boarding Zodiacs – sturdy rubber boats that carried us ashore or on exploration rides.

##Crossing the Drake & a bit on Icebergs

To reach Antarctica from South America, we had to cross the Drake Passage, one of the roughest seas on Earth. Winds can exceed 100 km/h (62 mph), and waves sometimes reach 15 meters (50 ft) high. Between the 17th and 19th centuries, around 800 ships sank there. But we were in luck and the crossing went smoothly both on the way there and back.

As we neared Antarctica, icebergs appeared. In November summer began in Antarctica, and with temperatures around 0C the ice was melting. If an iceberg is white, it means it’s relatively young. If it’s blue, that means the ice has been compacted over thousands of years, and now filters out certain wavelengths of light. About 80–90% of an iceberg is underwater, and because seawater is warmer than air, the submerged part melts faster, sometimes causing icebergs to flip over. 

I witnessed as one began to overturn and split apart – an incredible moment. It was so grand, but also fast and fleeting that I chose to save it in my memory instead of my phone.

##Zodiac boat cruises

Every day, we made explorations cruises on the Zodiacs. Dressed in full waterproof gear (jacket, pants, boots, gloves) we boarded in groups. At first, people wobbled nervously as they stepped in, but after a few trips, everyone got the hang of it.

Some days, the boats drifted slowly among the ice, other times, flew fast across open water. We always found something interesting. One of the highlights was a floating whaling factory that shipwrecked nearly 100 years ago. We also scooped ice chunks from the sea a couple times. One particularly nice piece ended up in the ship’s bar for cocktails.

##Weddell Seals

Besides icebergs, what did we see while cruising? Seals! Mostly Weddell seals, which only live in Antarctica. They can hold their breath for an hour while hunting krill, fish, and octopuses. I had assumed all seals ate penguins, but turns out, not all of them do.

After their deep dives, they lounge on the ice all day, behaving like oversized cats. Nothing threatens them on land as the polar bears only live in the Arctic.

Underwater they make bizarre, otherworldly sounds, like a techno party in full swing. If you’re curious, search for “Weddell seal vocalizations” on YouTube. It’s wild.

One day, we came across a juvenile elephant seal – a big brown blob with a large snout. I wanted to attach a photo, but Reddit’s limits had other plans. Still, quite the sight. 

##Landings & Penguin Colonies

Not every Zodiac trip was just a cruise, half the time, we landed on islands or the Antarctic continent itself. Before letting us disembark, the expedition team scouted the area for interesting sights like glaciers, penguins, or sleeping seals, then checked for dangerous crevasses in the ice. Once they flagged a safe path, we were good to go.

Penguins were everywhere. To prevent the spread of avian flu, we sanitized our boots before and after every landing and stayed at least 5 meters away from them. We also avoided crouching, so any potential contaminants wouldn’t transfer on jackets. Penguins, in turn, were completely unfazed by humans. They waddled right up to the boats or dove alongside them. Since the signing of the Antarctic Treaty 65 years ago, no one has hunted them.

We also visited an Argentine emergency shelter, stocked with food and a radio for stranded expeditions. It’s also Argentina’s way of staking a territorial claim in case the Antarctic Treaty is ever dissolved. Passed by several research stations, including the Primavera base, which studies rare mosses and lichens growing in an area where the permafrost has retreated. Couldn’t visit without permission though.

##More about penguins

At the start of the trip, our expedition leader joked that we’d soon be rolling our eyes, saying, “Ugh, more penguins.” He wasn’t wrong.

We mostly saw two species:
- Gentoo penguins with red beaks. Their population is growing, possibly because they feed their chicks for a couple of extra weeks. 
- Chinstrap penguins, named for the black stripe on their chins. 
Also spotted a few Adelie penguins, but they mainly live farther south.

What came as a surprise to me is penguin colonies stink. You can smell them from hundreds of meters away. My parka still carried the scent when I got back home, despite my last penguin encounter being four days earlier. These stinkies have interesting cooling strategies: since they don’t sweat, they either take a swim, gape their beaks open, or lift their flippers to expose thinner-feathered skin.

At this time of year (early December), penguins were nesting. They build their nests out of stones, leading to constant rock theft between neighbors. They also had to deal with skuas – birds pretend to rest in the colony, then suddenly snatch an egg. The penguins respond by screaming, stretching their necks, and snapping their beaks until the intruder leaves. 

In Gentoo and Adelie families males and females take turns incubating eggs, swapping shifts every few days. A true team effort! They don’t rest the eggs on their feathers but on a special patch of bare skin to keep them warm. 

##Sleeping on the Ice

One landing was unique: 30 of us spent the night sleeping on the ice. The ship dropped us off on a shore with no penguins and sailed away. We stomped out sleeping spots, laid down mats and sleeping bags, and settled in. I took a few Lego figurines with me for fun photos and as a souvenir to bring back.

Slept for maybe two hours. First, because how do you sleep in Antarctica? Second, because it was the beginning of the polar day – so no real night for me. Third, it started snowing, and became increasing harder to breath in the sleeping bag while also not getting covered in snow.

I woke up first and got to watch a seal swim nearby. Some of my neighbors, however, were rudely awakened by mating skuas right next to them. Yes, there’s video. No, I’m not posting it.

##Orcas and a Humpback

We encountered orcas twice. These apex predators eat anything that swims: seals, whales, even great whites in warmer waters. Scientists might eventually classify them as multiple distinct species, since some specialize in hunting penguins, others seals, others whales etc.

I also caught a glimpse of a humpback whale. Fun fact: each humpback has a unique pattern on the underside of its tail, like a fingerprint. I submitted my photo to the HappyWhale database and now I can track if anyone else spots “my” whale in the future.

##Final takeaway

I can talk endlessly about all of this, but really the trip was beyond words. Antarctica is stunning and surreal. If you ever get the chance to visit – go for it. 

Happy to share more details and answer questions if you have any.

travel,1jypx1g,Passport was taken away when coming home from international flight?,"Is this something you’ve ever heard of? Came home from Mexico to New Jersey today and when I finally reached the end of the security line, they took me into secondary screening.

I was convinced I’d be stuck at the airport for at least another hour; but after about 10 minutes they told me my passport was reported stolen or missing… Now I’ve obviously never done that myself, and I explained that to which they believed. However, they told me they had to keep it to discard of it, and I’d simply have to get a new passport. 

Having travelled all day, I didn’t bother arguing or inquiring any further outside of surface level questions on the matter since I was tired. They let me exit without my passport and I was told I’d need to get a new one. Last time I needed a new passport I was a minor, so I did not think much of it. But now I’m seeing how expensive they can be and am calling bs as I still had multiple years left before expiration.

Because of some factor outside of my control, I have to now shelve over money for a new passport? It doesn’t help that I am leaving the country again in July. Does anyone have any advice or tips on how I should proceed? Thanks in advance!

travel,1jxc65n,Some of my favourite images from Bhutan,"We just got back from Bhutan yesterday. We left from Paro airport ( currently the only international airport) 

11 night is total were spent across the following areas. 

Thimphu to Punakha to Phobjikha valley to Paro.

The whole experience was a great mixture of culture, relaxation and nature with lots of hikes. Both of us are not into hiking back home, so we both went hiking every weekend for 3 months before our trip. Definitely a must as some of these walks are above 3000m and we could the difference. 

All the people were lovely warm and trustworthy. They always asked if this was our first time and how we heard about Bhutan. It was a fair question, as most of the people at work had heard of it but didn't know where it was. 

They also said to spread the word. So here I am HIGHLY RECOMMEND GOING TO BHUTAN. 

It's expensive but it's one of those bucket list places that should be ticked off if you can afford it. 

The only thing I would change if we went again would be the timing. There were quiet a few forrest fires around due to it being so dry. This made visibility limiting at times. You can probably see it in the photos.  A better time to go would be in August or September I think.  

I hope you enjoy the photos. ",3464,0.99,92,2025-04-12 07:52:49,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jxc65n,jimmyax
travel,1k2ud56,I keep getting stopped at the US border and I just found it’s because of multiple “no shows”?,"I had just flown back to my hometown in Canada to visit after living in Europe for half a year. There was a good priced flight with a layover in Washington DC, which I didn’t think was gonna be a big deal. Luckily I had chosen the flight with a layover of 3 hours because I would’ve missed my connecting flight if I had chosen the 1h30m one. I flew Paris to Washington and final destination being Toronto. When I got off in Washington, I realized I had to go through US customs to get to my connecting flight gate.

It was 8PM, not many people there and of course I get stopped. They put my passport in a locked security case and sent me to a room for questioning. No one was else was in the room but me so I sat there waiting while the worker looked through my file for a good 5-10 minutes and eventually started questioning my whole life story. “Where are you from? Where do you live now? What do you do for work? Explain your job to me.” Then the questions started getting more intense. “Where are your clients? How do you get your clients? Can you show me examples of your work?” He wanted me to show him my portfolio as I worked in the creative industry, and explain each project. I was thinking to myself that this was insane, he asked for my portfolio? Are these questions normal? 

Eventually I got sent to another officer for them to look through my entire suitcase and backpack while being asked my life story again. Same questions while i’m being questioned about the contents of my baggage.

I had gone through this once before 9 years ago when I went to NY, and I have no idea why. I thought at that time that it was a random questioning because that was the first time I had travelled alone. Since then, there had been a few incidents where I had been questioned a bit longer than usual at the border but it was nothing compared to this. It had stopped after the last 2 times I had visited the US so I thought I was fine. After those last 2 times, I hadn’t really had to go through the US or visited so I had a nice quiet period until today.

The officer had informed me that I was being questioned because of my “big number of no shows for flights” and asked me about every trip I’ve made to and through the US. He said he’s asking me all these questions to make sure my story is right…. Whatever that means. I had told him there was only 2 incidents I could think of that was a “no show”. One being me booking another flight a few days before my current one to go home earlier. The other being that I had missed the fight because I didn’t make the baggage check in time but had still gotten on the flight right after. The officer said that it doesn’t show my on my record the reason why there’s a no show but it just shows multiple no shows. I don’t even know what the other number of no shows would’ve been but now with this on my file I don’t even want to set foot in the US again and have to go through this.

Has this happened to anyone? Any advice, I have another layover in Chicago to go back to Europe next week and I am really not looking forward to that.",2928,0.95,224,2025-04-19 11:42:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k2ud56/i_keep_getting_stopped_at_the_us_border_and_i/,security000

travel,1k1hi3f,Istanbul has gone over the edge as an enjoyable vacation destination.  It is legitimately nothing more than a nuisance now,"The last time I was there in 2017 it was borderline..........I was thinking ""maybe I just had a bad experience"" and to not write off the city entirely.  That time I at least got to check down on many of the important tourism sites and could tune out a lot of the ""buy my leather, buy my carpet, buy my jewelry"" crap.  This time, I tried to ""do more local stuff"" hoping to get away from that........oh no, the merchants still aggressively swarm you as if you are fresh meat in a zombie apocolypse movie.  Additionally, the outright harassment of my wife, whom Im well aware is attractive.  There is absolutely no shame in their approaches to her even when we are together.  Probably nearly got in a fight a dozen times.  I am a nice person by nature, but for the first time, not only do I have to be outright mean to these sorts of people........I actually got a degree of pleasure shouting them away this time.  Additionally, the carpet, leather, and jewelry guys also simply do not relent now.........""law enforcement"" sees it,  and does absolutely nothing about it (probably because they are getting their cut too).  I challenge you.........as a tourist.......go try and sit on a bench by Blue Mosque.  If you can make it one minute without a hustler trying to sell you their shit, that would be slightly impressive.

The last day we legitimately stayed in the hotel room the whole time and didnt leave the hotel property.  We got our scam taxi back to the airport and emphatically agreed ""never again"".  I actually feel like quite the dumbass for talking myself into returning because my wife hadnt seen the sites.

I dont need to go back.  To people in Turkey, you are just nothing more than a tourist who deserves a financial shakedown.  They could care less what they think about their city now, perhaps more than ever.  Turkish hospitality as it was once known and revered is absolutely dead.  This goes doubly if you are a remotely attractive woman.........you will harassed even if you are with your significant other.  If you are single?  Hell.........God/Allah/Krishna/Bhudda help you........you're in for a hell of a ride.  I cannot imagine how nightmarish that would be for a single woman.

Puebla - This Mexican metropolis of 3 million has some of the most incredible baroque churches I’ve seen and great food. It’s so close to Mexico City and yet gets little foreign tourism.

Tainan - The Kyoto of Taiwan that seems to be completely ignored outside of Taiwanese. Very historic and beautiful pictures with historic structures next to palm trees and mangroves.

Wroclaw - Very cheap, with a historic center, beautiful monumental structures (Wroclaw Town Hall, Centennial Hall) and some stunning churches.

We passed through many garbage patches like this. This is supposed to be a UNESCO world heritage site. I am deeply regretful to have participated in this.

The staff on your boat may even fish in this water and feed it to you for dinner.

I think it’s a very sad situation. It’s such a beautiful place otherwise. I hope the government takes some measures to fix this.",2204,0.95,261,2025-04-08 15:53:03,https://i.redd.it/kc0gnforumte1.jpeg,Empty_Try8500
travel,1jsuona,Scary scams in Istanbul we experienced - beware,"My friend and I went to Istanbul a few weeks ago. I am making this post to warn people about these scams and to make sure you know what you're getting into if you decide to go to Istanbul. Be safe. I have traveled all over the world and never experienced scams like this. Istanbul can be scary.

One of the scams that really scared my friend and I was the police scam. We read about this scam before we went. We were walking on a busy road in Istanbul (on the European side) in the middle of the day. We were approached by a gang of about 5 men. They stopped us and started shouting at us - ""police, police, show us your passports!"". We immediately knew that this was a scam. One of the guys showed us a fake police badge and again demanded we give them our passports. My friend tried to walk away but one of the scammers grabbed him. We told them we didn't believe them and that we will call the police to check. They didn't listen and kept on demanding we show them our passports. After about 5 minutes we told them we don't have our passports on us. They then finally let us go. That was really scary and ruined our entire vacation. We later read that they usually take your passport hostage and demand payment or threaten to damage your passport if you don't pay. The scary thing was, all the locals were watching on and did nothing. 

Another concerning scam was the photography scam. We were taking a ferry across the bosphorous in the afternoon. During the trip we noticed a young woman setting up a table at the front of the ferry seating area. During the trip her and another young woman who seemed to be working for the ferry started approaching passengers on the ferry. They asked us if we wanted pictures and that they will take pictures of us for free. My friend and I knew this was a scam so we declined. The woman didn't seem happy about this. She and the other woman approached a young family of three. A mother, father and a little girl. The family didn't realise it was a scam and allowed one of the photographers to take pictures of them. They then sat down after their pictures were taken. When the ferry ride came to an end, the photographer demanded payment. The family declined and said they don't want any of their pictures. The photographer didn't let them leave the ferry. My friend and I left the ferry and the family was still on the ferry. The family looked afraid. It was clear the photographers were working with the ferry and the crew. We don't know if the family was allowed to leave the ferry or if they were held hostage until they paid up. All we know is they were probably traumatised after the experience.

Lastly, another scam that stood out to us was the tourist scam. It's when a fake tour guide will just start talking to you really fast and force a guide on you. They then demand payment. This happened to us in the mosque. The Turkish man literally tried to scam us in the mosque! He also showed us a fake tour guide badge. He got really annoyed when we walked away.

We enjoyed some of the food there and the mosques, but be careful, I've never experienced scams like this. The scammers can be very aggressive. It feels almost lawless in Istanbul. We saw lots of elderly and female tourists being targeted. In my opinion it's not safe for some people to go. If you do decide to go, go in a group and have some men with you. Istanbul is also expensive now. Food and tickets for places like palaces are very expensive.

travel,1jz1p26,A week in Rome,"These pictures are from February of this year: the Forum, Galeria Borghese, Circus Maximus, Mercato Testaccio, the Forum (from the POV of Palatine Hill), St. Peter’s Basilica, Capitoline Museum, and Piazza Navona. The other pics were just cool shots from around Monti, Testaccio, and one of the bridges across the Tiber.

Honestly, I was pleasantly surprised how manageable the crowds were given the Jubilee year. The busiest attractions were Trevi Fountain and the Vatican Museums, but even then, I don’t imagine that it was much more crowded than how it is during peak season any other year. 

I stayed for 9 days / 8 nights including a day trip, and I think that was plenty of time to see most things at our leisure, take side quests to explore without feeling rushed, and have a couple slow days to just eat, drink, and shop. We probably could’ve hit more things that were lower on our list, but at a certain point it’s easy to get a little history and culture overload that makes it difficult to appreciate everything to the full extent. For example, the Capitoline was great in its own right but paled in comparison to the Borghese and Vatican galleries that we went to during other parts of the trip. Same with different ruins and historical sites; I knew there was more to see, but after seeing the most popular spots and a day trip to Pompeii, we weren’t really motivated to see the things that were further out or cost money (the Appian Way, Baths of Caracalla, etc). Both my friend and I do expect to come back to Rome someday though. 

I came home with some leather goods and a moka pot. I found that my boots and the Bialetti cost roughly the same as in the US, but no-name brand purses from the touristy leather shops around town felt like a deal. For €134, I got two handbags and a wallet, so given it being real leather, I feel like that’s pretty good compared to what’s available to me at home for the same price.

If I had to do it again, I’d probably book a multi-city plane ticket rather than a round trip one and take the train to add another city in, but it was still a great trip!",1831,0.99,41,2025-04-14 15:29:16,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jz1p26,JCOhMyBuddha
travel,1jqgroa,HELP PLEASE- Left Passport on plane and being told they are going to send me home.,"I just flew on TAP Air 204 from EWR to Lisbon. I left my passport and wallet in my seat back pocket. I messed up big time. I am sitting in the police holding station in the airport. They are telling me no one has found my passport. It was in the seat back pocket, 100%. Now I am just sitting here feeling hopeless. They are saying they are going to send me back today. Does anyone have any advice??? Is there any TAP air number I can call??? All the ones I have called have done nothing. Just forwarded me to someone else. Please help. I am devestated.


*UPDATE*
Holy Hannah this post blew up. Supporters, thanks for the support and advice. Haters, I deserve it. Bonehead move on my part. I just landed back at Newark, waiting to get off plane. I was pretty much completely denied being allowed to talk to TAP while in Lisbon. Hopefully I can speak to a gate agent here and get some info. The plane I was on went back to Newark after my flight, and I am hopelessly hoping it was on that flight and made it back here... if so, I'm getting on the 1050 flight back😂. If not, I secured an 8am passport appointment in the city tomo morning. If all goes well, hopefully I can get on the 5pm out of Newark tomo and meet my lady to salvage some of our trip! Also, still need to hope I make it through customs at a reasonable hour tonight. Global Entry, its your time to SHINE.

*UPDATE 2*
Global Entry for the W. Walked right back into the U S of A, no questions asked. Not one form of ID on me. TAP in EWR was just as useless, call this email that, no one could give a shit and I no longer have the energy to push. Going home and getting some sleep, then passport place in the AM. Also, TAP seemed to cancel my flight home because I flew home today... seems kinda fair but also kinda BS. Any advice on that? Should I just eat my loss and rebook round trip? Sorry if my wording right now is confusing I am delerious.


*UPDATE 3* For anyone still curious... I got my passport at 2pm in NY today. Made the 535pm flight to lisbon out of ewr. Currently in the customs line in Lisbon. Wish me luck!

*FINAL UPDATE* Cleared customs! 48 hour detour and way too much money later, we made it.",1735,0.91,554,2025-04-03 12:11:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jqgroa/help_please_left_passport_on_plane_and_being_told/,IndependenceFinal274
travel,1jvavr4,Someone explain Denver to me. Visited again and I don’t know if I’m doing it ”wrong”.,"
Like, I just visited yet again… and it’s a place I should love! Like it checks all these boxes for things I like or am interested in. 

The best way I can describe it is it’s like the hospital of cities. Sure it’s clean, it feels relatively safe, people are generally welcoming… but all in the same way a hospital is sterile, like it’s not welcoming and inviting, it feels like I’m in a sims game when I’m there, just sorta bland and dystopian.

I walked much of the city, kinda was based around “Lodo”… never ate at the same place twice, tried to avoid travel guide suggestions, I tried to find input from locals instead.

EDIT: you all make perfect sense clarifying that the allure of Denver is the mountains and nature surrounding, maybe I approached it wrong as I live at the base of a mountain already so I was looking at Denver as purely a city experience.

EDIT2: a bit more context of some of the US cities I’ve visited and the vibes I’ve gotten from them. 
-New York, Chicago and Detroit has that grittiness of a city.
-Boston (my favorite city) has a sort of coziness for me, it’s a city but feels like a town.
-Miami is sorta vibrant even tho a lot of the people are pretty closed off.
 -Atlanta is a bit dirtier and grimy (probably how Chicago or Detroit would feel if it was stuck in the wet heat of the south)",1738,0.92,588,2025-04-09 17:03:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jvavr4/someone_explain_denver_to_me_visited_again_and_i/,nooneshome00

If you are on the fence about visiting this region of the world or Jordan, I strongly recommend to give it a go. It is an extraordinary place to visit, with hospitable locals, unique sights, and an exceptional rich history.

Seems like people go there, sit by the pool, and eat/drink. Maybe get a massage. Most people probably don’t even swim in the pools, let alone go in the ocean. It seems really boring to me? Just sitting around? The only appeal I get is not having to cook or think about food. 

I guess I tend to like hiking or museums or architecture or visiting landmarks like old monasteries or castles. 

I can go sit at the beach (albeit it would be a beach in South Boston) and eat a lobster roll for like $30 so why would I fly to Cabo to do that?

travel,1jp2tsw,"London, just like what I imagined","Just went to London last weekend. Here are some personal experiences and suggestions

The British Museum: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

The best museum I’ve ever been to. All kinds of artifacts from all over the world. You feel like you’re really close to them because many of them are unprotected. You could easily touch them (Not recommended). I saw a kid just climb onto a 3,000-year-old artifact, and I was shocked.

Tips: You don’t have to wait outside for the security check if you don’t bring any bags. Just tell them you don’t have bags, and they will let you in.

Tower Bridge: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Went there at night. It’s a lot bigger than I thought and it’s so beautiful.

Tips: Wear more clothes when you walk on the bridge. It’s very cold.

London Tower: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

A historic castle, and it’s right next to the Tower Bridge. You can see some royal armour and what a castle looks like. The castle life isn’t as good as I imagined. The doors are short, and the passages are very narrow. The most interesting part is that you can see all the kings and queens’ crowns. The crown jewels are so beautiful, but no photos are allowed. Unique experience.

Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, London Eye, and Hyde Park: ⭐⭐⭐

Buckingham Palace is not open now. All you can do is take a picture. Same as Big Ben, take a picture. But they are landmarks, so you should go, just nothing there. The London Eye and Hyde Park are really not recommended. You can find sky wheels and parks like these anywhere in the world.

The National Gallery: ⭐⭐⭐

It should be 5 stars for artists, but I’m not. The paintings are great, and it feels different when you see them in person than when you see them in pictures. Also, many paintings' sizes are a lot larger than I thought. They all have the same size in the pictures. 😂 You should go if you have time.

The Natural History Museum: ⭐⭐

Only recommended if you have kids. Maybe kids like it. It’s so huge but very empty. Just like any natural history museum in the world. There’s nothing special about it.

Fish and Chips: Zero Star

Do not try it. Very expensive, 22 ₤, but it tastes worse than the cheap frozen cod from Costco, and the chips are worse than the fries from McDonald's.

Summary:

I like this city. The English accent is easier to understand than in other UK cities. Two days are enough to visit most attractions in London if you just want to take some pictures and see some famous stuff.

Public transportation is very convenient. You can use Apple Pay to go anywhere.

You can feel you’re in London when you see people wearing stylish clothes. It was around 10 degrees, and I saw so many girls wearing shorts or skirts on the street when I felt so cold in trousers. Probably should go there when the weather is warmer.

I used ChatGPT to find the recommended museums in London, as shown in the last picture. It was good for museums and attractions but not very good for finding restaurants, which recommended pizza in London 😂

I would absolutely recommend London for traveling👍",1684,0.9,254,2025-04-01 18:24:26,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jp2tsw,jason_houdini

travel,1jydhwm,You will get what you pay for.,"Certain travelers, when having bad experiences in developing countries, try to equate it to problems in the country itself. I say this because of the constant complaints from tourists about doing things even local travelers won't do.

If you take Greyhound buses in the US, try to fly Spirit Airlines, or stay in a <$100 per day hotel, you will not have the best experience. The same is true in developing countries. 

If you go to reputable hotels/restaurants, avoid public transport, and have a highly rated guide or private travel, you will avoid most of the problems in developing countries. 

If you want to stay in budget hotels and travel in public transport in developing countries, you must account for the experience yourself.

travel,1jz6ts7,"Etihad's ""Free Stopover"" turned into a stressful trap – extremely disappointed","I wanted to share a frustrating experience with Etihad that turned what should've been a cool Abu Dhabi stopover into a really disappointing situation.

I recently booked an international flight directly through Etihad’s official website. While booking, I selected the “Free Stopover in Abu Dhabi” option – the promotion that gives you up to 2 complimentary nights in a hotel. I also spoke with two customer service agents who confirmed I was eligible.

Now, after finalizing the booking and trying to reserve the hotel, they’re suddenly saying I have to pay for it. I’ve spoken with several agents since then, and each one gives me a different explanation – some say I’m eligible, some say I’m not, and no one can give me a clear answer. It’s been incredibly stressful, time-consuming, and frankly, misleading.

I feel like I’ve been tricked by a bait-and-switch promo. I even had to write to their data protection office under GDPR to request a full copy of the internal notes and call records, because of how contradictory the communication has been. (Still haven't got it btw)

This whole situation made me lose trust in Etihad, and I want to warn other travelers: if you see that stopover promo — triple check every detail before booking and make sure you get any confirmations in writing.

Has anyone else experienced this? Would love to hear your thoughts or advice.

In Japan, we were able to visit some highly crowded and Instagrammed sites completely by ourselves because we were there at 5:00 am; in Italy, we were in line for museums that have a strict entrance quota an hour before open. Instead of lying in bed and cursing your brain, eat a protein bar for breakfast and get out in the early morning. 

Even if you don’t have jet lag, being able to wake up early to sightsee is amazing.

I get the vegetarian meals, and very often they're clearly NOT vegan - they contain cheese and eggs (which is great for me!). BUT I NEVER GET CAKE. I only get the fruit bowl. I can see my neighbors devouring their delicious brownies and apple cakes and GET SO SAD. Worse, I sometimes lose out even more since half of my fruit bowl is melons of some sort. Pineapple, strawberry, grapes - awesome. Honeydew?? MISS ME WITH THAT SHIT.

WHY DON'T I GET CAKE?? I WANT CAKE :(( I know there's sometimes lard in cakes BUT MOST OFTEN NOT. GIMME CAKE. WTF ;\_;

edit: I mentioned they're clearly not vegan since it makes sense for the vegan option not to have cake - it could contain milk/eggs. And that's fine in the vegetarian option so I don't understand why cake isn't included there.

also: One time I did ask for cake and they said ""sorry"" and didn't give me any.

But isn’t it just as important to travel when you’re older, with more freedom and experience? 

Why does youth always have to be the golden age for exploring?

Maybe the best adventures come when you have the wisdom and resources to truly appreciate them. 🤔

travel,1jjppfl,"Went to Ski in Grandvalira - Anodrra, and spent the weekend in Barcelona","We decided to visit Andorra to ski, and spent the weekend in Barcelona. We heard the skiing in Andorra was fantastic, so we decide why  not! Why not have an excuse to visit a new place right? The skiing was decent, we got 2 days of clear skies. Not everything was open, but I would say Andorra is a beginner/intermediates dream ski area. To get to Andorra is easy, there are busses all day long to the villages from the airport. We decided to stay in Pas de la Casa as it was more like a small town with things to do/eat/nightlife, but it was still very very limited. The ski resort is called Grandvalira, and you can ski from town to town.

We decided to spend a day down in the capital, which was only a short bus ride. The capital is known for its shopping, and this massive spa resort. We ate at some nice places, and the shopping was meh. We were able to walk through the capital twice in half a day while stopping at some shops, but there wasn't to many interesting things.  I would say its probably not worth the 3 hour bus ride from Barcelona if you weren't coming to do any mountain activities. I heard the mountain biking is fantastic.

We then spent the weekend in Barcelona, did the usual tourist things like eat at the market, and visit the Gaudi architecture.  The food was fantastic, and one thing I really recommend doing is join a bar crawl. We have done bar crawls all over the world now, and for around $20 its great. You get to meet new people, go to bars that you would have never found, and the $20 includes drinks/shots at each of the 4-5 bars/clubs you will visit.

travel,1js9toe,"Marrakech, Morocco","This February, I spent a few days in beautiful Marrakech, Morocco. From a tourist perspective, the city is mainly a large medina (old town) surrounded by medieval walls. Most of the main sights are located within this area.

My favorite landmarks were the Ben Youssef Madrasa (a historic Islamic university) and the Koutoubia Mosque—though, unfortunately, non-Muslims aren’t allowed to enter the latter. The biggest square, Jemaa el-Fna, is an intense experience. It’s mostly filled with stalls or carpets covered in souvenirs and other goods. There are also plenty of snakes and monkeys, though sadly, their living conditions aren’t great. Close to the square is the touristy section of the souk—colorful and vibrant, selling all sorts of trinkets. It can get a bit overwhelming, especially with the constant need to dodge bikes and motorcycles.

Interestingly, this tourist-heavy zone is really just a central strip of the medina. As you move toward the edges—around places like the old Jewish cemetery, the synagogue, and the tanneries—it quickly becomes more local. The colorful, ornate shops selling mugs, teapots, carpets, and sweets fade into market stalls offering fish (always surrounded by cats lol), meat, vegetables, and fruit. I actually enjoyed this side more

Outside the medina, the only major sight is Jardin Majorelle, a botanical garden surrounding the famous blue Cubist villa, filled with cacti and other plants. I definitely recommend reserving tickets in advance—entry is limited, and you likely won’t be able to buy tickets at the entrance.

While many people warn about tourist scams, I found my experience to be quite different. Overall, people were very welcoming. Sellers weren’t as pushy as in Tunisia (at least in my experience). The only annoying thing was that if you looked lost, someone would immediately offer to “help” you—for a tip, of course. But usually, a simple “La, shukran” (No, thank you) solved the issue. We even visited the tanneries, which get terrible reviews on Google Maps, without paying anything to self-proclaimed guides standing around the entrance.

Overall I really liked the city, I enjoyed it much more than our daytrips in Morocco (Imlil and Ouzoud waterfalls). It is sometimes bit dirty and loud, but nothing overwhelmingly annoying. The food is also excellent. Just bring cash, even the main tourist sights (excluding Jardin Majorelle) mostly demanded payment in it.",894,0.99,20,2025-04-05 18:17:11,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1js9toe,AMSparta17
travel,1jptnu7,"A week in Rome, February 2025","February was a perfect time to explore the city. It was in the high 50s or even 60 degrees most days. Some days we didn’t even need coats as long as we had a sweatshirt or sweater on. The crowds were only really bad at the really famous sights, but we alleviated that as best we could by booking the earliest entry tickets we could get.  Usually 8am.  We had a great Airbnb right near the Tiber River across from Castel San Angelo in a quiet area with fun alleyways to explore along with plenty of shops, gelato and cafes. Walking distance to pizza navona, Vatican City, the Pantheon, Spanish steps, trevi fountain, as well as a taxi stand to take us anywhere else we couldn’t walk to.  Prices were very reasonable for eating and sightseeing.  Roman cuisine is excellent. The pastas. The organ meats. Cheap wine (10 euro for a liter of house wine). 

I visited Rome 25 years ago after college and I loved it even more the 2nd time as did my wife and kids who were on their first visit.    A week was enough for us, we did heavy sightseeing in the mornings, then would break for lunch and head back to apartment to relax before an afternoon walk to get gelato of do some light sightseeing.   You could certainly do everything in say, 3 days, but we didn’t want such a grueling pace. We did take a separate day trip to Pompeii and Naples one day.  I will post photos of that separately.

travel,1jr0doa,Trip to Moldova and Romania,"Spent two weeks in March exploring a bit of Moldova and Romania. My trip started in Moldova, where I spent about 4 days in Chișinău. The city itself doesn't take too long to explore and I'd say 1,5 days are enough to check most of it.

After that, I went to Tiraspol. The trip to Transnistria was pretty smooth: I took a marshrutka from Chișinău to Tiraspol, which then stopped at the border between Moldova and Transnistria. There, they checked my passport and asked how long I would stay. Received a piece of paper that allowed to stay for 12hrs and, in Tiraspol, I exchanged some Moldovan lei for Transnistrian roubles and visited most of the places I had previously tagged (it's hard, even with a Moldovan eSIM, to get a proper connection once you pass the border, although there are places with WiFi). I took another marshrutka in the afternoon back to Chișinău.

My last trip in Moldova was to Orheiul Vechi. Just like the trip to Tiraspol, I went to the central bus station in Chișinău and took a marshrutka to the village of Butuceni. From there, it's a short walk to the top of the hill where the old Orthodox monastery is located - the views are incredible from there and worth the visit. Schedules to and from Orheiul Vechi can be found on their website.

Romania:

I took a flight from Chișinău to Bucharest, where I stayed for about 3 days. The city can be a trip of its own and was quite impressed with the size and scale of some of its buildings and avenues.

After Bucharest, I took a train to Brașov. I decided to stay there for 4 days: it included one day in Sibiu and a day tour of Bran and Peleș Castles and Râșnov Fortress. Brașov is a charming city and can also serve as a base for exploring Transylvania. I got to and from Sibiu by train and as for the tour itself, they can be a good alternative to renting a car and still checking some of the main highlights in a limited time.

From Brașov, I went to Cluj - my last stop in this trip. It's a vibrant city and I didn't expect it to enjoy it as much as I did. I stayed for 3 days, including a trip to Salina Turda and another day tour, this time to Sighişoara and Biertan. To visit Salina Turda, I took a bus from Cluj to Turda and then walked from Turda's city centre to the old entrance of the salt mine. The Turda Salt Mine is impressive and a great option to spend half a day if you have some time to spare in Cluj. Sighişoara is also really worth a visit.

travel,1jk0j3j,Got to our hotel in Cancun after a long 16 hour journey. Upon arrival we were informed that the hotel has been double booked and that they would book us into another hotel for 5 or the 7 nights and then upgrade is for the last 2. Advice needed.,"My wife and I arrived at our hotel in Cancun (after a 16 hour journey from the UK) we don't want to mention the name of the hotel. Upon arrival we went to the check-in desk and the host informed us that unfortunately the hotel had been double booked and that they would be unable to let us stay in the hotel for five of the seven nights that we have booked. 

They said that they would move us into a different hotel for five of the nights and that we could return for the final two nights and that they would upgrade our all-inclusive to a premium all-inclusive and also upgrade our room and saying we have no other option than to go with this. 

We reluctantly said we would go to the hotel and then they tried to to give us a piece of paper and asked us to sign it where the piece of paper mentioned that we voluntarily will be going, at this point red flag started being raised in my head and I said I'm not signing anything that says I voluntarily moved to this other hotel which is in no way the same level as the hotel we booked and not in an ideal location either. 

We then spent over an hour complaining that we're not signing anything that puts the liability on ourselves and said we will stay at this other hotel as we have no choice but that we're not signing the documents. 

They then tried to print off another document which had a reference to us ""volunteering"" and again we declined to sign this followed by another document which had the word ""authorise"" Which again we declined to sign. 

Eventually they put us in a taxi without having to sign any further documents and we've arrived at the hotel much to our dismay the hotel that we're in is nowhere near the level we expected or we paid for. 

We booked the holiday via a travel agent, love holidays, but unfortunately at the time of arrival the contact us details were already closed for love holidays. 

So our current status is that we're in this other hotel having not signed any documents from the original hotel and only signing the generic waiver that you receive at any hotel with regards to damages and losses at the new hotel. We intend to call love holiday first thing tomorrow morning and pick this up with them but keen to understand whether anyone else has any other ideas if this is common practise as it feels very scammy. 

We also paid for the holiday with our Amex platinum card and are wondering whether the travel insurance that comes with the Amex platinum will cover this issue.


UPDATE: Firstly thank you for all the help and advice (and the odd ignorant comment here and there). Just to note that the original hotel informed us we would not be able to utilise their facilities during this 5 day period unless we signed the original document which of course we refused to do.

We managed to get in contact with the love holidays emergency contact number yesterday evening whereby the agent confirmed that this is not right and that they contacted the hotel who indeed did inform them the hotel was over booked. The agent then informed us that they would relocate us to a different hotel of our choosing, they asked us to provide 3 options of hotels we would consider relocating to and we checked Google maps and suggested 3 that were in a similar area and we felt a similar level of service to what we had originally paid for.

After that we went to bed feeling a lot better about our situation and were somewhat optimistic.

In the morning we woke up and received an email from a different love holidays agent informing they've picked this up with their hotel supplier who was looking into it for us. 

Unfortunately, shortly after that we received a secondary email informing us that that they did not have any availability at any of the 3 hotels we listed. 

And that love holidays have asked their supplier if they can offer a like for like alternative within the same area. The supplier has offered to refund any unused nights and that we could look for alternative accommodation ourselves and that love holidays would refund the amount for the original booking. 

We have now responded to inform that the their response was not adequate and that they would either have to find us a suitable alternative accommodation, for our consideration, at a hotel with equal or better facilities than what we booked originally. Or alternatively we remain where we are for the 5 nights and then relocate to the other hotel for the final 2 nights, but if this is the case we would expect a full refund for the package holiday we've booked and paid for but are not getting.

I then stayed the rest of the trip in the coastal city of La Libertad. I visited nearby beaches in Surf City such as El Tunco and El Zonte. There's very good surf along the coast, if that's your thing. We found the beaches of La Libertad to be better for swimming since it's not as rocky as the others.

Overall, I really enjoyed my time there. My family and I felt safe throughout the trip and there's a big police/military presence for security. There's construction all throughout the country and it seems as if they're making improvements everywhere to bolster tourism. Driving was a breeze there and their official currency is USD and Bitcoin. Feel free to ask any questions.

I wanted to share my disappointing experience in Prague. Over the last three days, I visited the city and was really enjoying my time there. I thought it would be a great place for peaceful walks, and I even considered coming back for weekend strolls. However, on the third day, I experienced something that has left me feeling deeply upset.

That morning, I was physically assaulted by a man. He grabbed my scarf from behind and yelled at me. Despite the tram being full of people, no one reacted or helped. I suspect that this might have been a racially motivated attack, as I wear a headscarf. A friend who has lived here before told me that, although sad, such incidents are unfortunately common because of the high level of Islamophobia.

While I've faced verbal abuse on previous trips (only in Europe!), this physical attack was terrifying, and I am still shaken by it. I am now left with a sense of unease, and I am disappointed that this is how I will remember what otherwise seemed like a beautiful city.

travel,1jmyb7a,2 weeks in Japan: An in-depth review,"33M from Los Angeles, CA. I visited Japan for the first time last November on a 2-week solo trip.

I stayed at hotels in the following cities, traveling by train:

**Tokyo** (5 nights, Akasaka) – It feels massive, almost infinite. But it’s also very safe, tidy, and easy to get around. There are lively pockets, but quiet ones too. There’s a uniformity to the city, yet each neighborhood has a unique personality. Tons to discover here just wandering.

* **Highlights:** Skytree, Tokyo Tower, Pokémon Cafe & Centers, Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building light show, Sensō-ji, Meiji Jingu, Shinjuku, Shibuya, Harajuku, Akihabara, Ueno
* **Day Trip: Yokohama** – Surprisingly chill big city. Chinatown and the waterfront are fun to explore. Cool variety of architectural styles. The skyline is beautiful, especially at night.

**Kyoto** (3 nights, Mibubojocho) – Favorite city in terms of sights. Very spiritual-feeling with all the temples, shrines, and gardens. Public transit is a bit more challenging than other cities, but it works if you plan well.

* **Highlights:** Kinkaku-ji, Ginkaku-ji, Nijō Castle, Fushimi Inari Taisha, Arashiyama Bamboo Forest, Kiyomizu-dera night viewing, Giō-ji, Yasaka Pagoda, Higashiyama Ward, Nanzen-ji
* **Day Trip: Uji** – The Nintendo Museum has an amazing collection of video game box art, console prototypes, company history, and cute photo-ops. Nearby Byōdō-in is a fantastically picturesque temple. 

**Osaka** (3 nights, Shinsaibashi) – Similar aesthetic to Tokyo, but smaller and grittier. Lots of character. You’ll run into idol groups performing for fans, spirited kushikatsu cooks, and even quirky animatronic dinosaurs.

* **Highlights:** Osaka Castle, Shitennō-ji, Umeda Sky Building, Dotonbori, Shinsekai, Tsutenkaku, Abeno Harukas, Daimaru Nintendo Store, Pokémon Centers
* **Day Trip: Nara** – Very ancient-feeling. Tōdai-ji and Hōryū-ji are incredible. The Nara Park deer are very cute, but will hoover your crackers. Watch out for their droppings too.
* **Day Trip: Himeji** – Stopped here between Osaka and Hiroshima for four hours. Easy luggage storage in train station lockers. Himeji Castle dominates the town and is well worth the visit. The castle has elegant architecture with sprawling grounds, amazing history, and lovely views. 

**Hiroshima** (2 nights, Hatchobori) – Calmer and quieter than other cities, yet still active. You feel the weight of the city’s history, but also inspired by how it’s rebounded. The hills, forests, and water features of the Chūgoku region are beautiful. Being here felt moving and important.

* **Highlights:** Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, Peace Park, Hiroshima Castle
* **Day Trip: Miyajima** – Gorgeous setting with the mountains, trees, and bay. The floating torii has a very “edge of the world” feeling. The island is relaxing in the evening, with neat lighting and deer roaming around.

**Food & Drink:**

* On the US dollar, meals are cheap. You can get a full dinner and alcoholic beverage for \~$12.
* Department store and mall food courts offer fantastic meals. Izakaya are a cozier option.
* Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki edges out Kansai-style for me, but both are great.
* Akashiyaki with tuna flakes was a highlight. Octopus tastes more like pork than squid.
* Ramen and sushi can vary widely in quality. 
* Ekiben taste remarkably fresh for boxed meals.
* 7/11 snacks are delicious with amazing variety. The chocolate-covered banana ice cream Monaka was my favorite, along with the pickled plum rice ball.
* Other standout sweets include ohagi, momiji manjū, Galbo Choco, and Planet Mousse balls.
* The pride taken in food presentation is very much appreciated.
* Of the big three Japanese beers – Sapporo, Kirin, Asahi – I think Sapporo is best.
* I prefer sake warm and sweet. Iced plum wine is also great.
* Vending machines being everywhere is so convenient. Warm royal milk tea and cold orange tea were highlights.

**General Thoughts:**

* Japanese people are very polite and helpful! Even without me asking, locals would do things like pull my luggage off the rack at my train stop, show me where to hang my coat, etc.
* English is not widely spoken, but there are lots of signs in English, Chinese, and Korean.
* Learning a bit of Japanese (Sumimasen, Arigatō gozaimasu) will enhance your experience.
* School kids on field trips practicing English with me was really endearing.
* The abundance of clean public toilets with bidets and white noise is incredible.
* Public baths are a great local way to unwind in after a long flight or sightseeing day.
* The expectation of silence on public transport is so relaxing.
* The omnipresence of cute characters is delightful.
* Konbini always have what you need despite limited inventory.
* How do all the clothing stores stay in business? There are so many!
* The tradition of covering Jizō statues with bibs and hats is especially touching.

**Tips:**

* Business hotels are a great bang for your buck. Impressive use of limited space.
* If you can’t get a reservation at Tokyo’s Pokémon Cafe, try the standby line. I arrived at 6pm on a Tuesday and was seated in 20 minutes.
* Fall is a great time to visit. Ginkgo and maple foliage are stunning, and crowds were manageable at most sights (Kiyomizu-dera being the exception).
* Be ready for rain. Umbrella bags outside many public buildings are handy.
* Consider an uncrowded night visit to Fushimi Inari Taisha. Look out for tanuki.
* If you want to see Mt. Fuji, book a right-side seat on a Tokyo > Kyoto train, or a left-side seat on a Hiroshima > Tokyo flight. Clouds may obscure your view.
* Google Maps works well, but it’s very easy to get lost in the maze of department stores.
* IC cards are convenient for transit, vending machines, etc. I used digital Suica on my iPhone.
* Shinkansen tickets: Smart EX wouldn’t take my American credit cards, so I reserved tickets through JR West. Had to print them in person at a JR kiosk once I arrived in Japan.

**Budget:**

* Total: $3650
   * Flights: $1400 via All Nippon Airways (LAX to NRT, direct; HIJ to LAX, layover in HND)
   * Hotels & Airbnbs: $1460 (Kyoto most expensive, Tokyo and Osaka surprisingly cheap)
   * Train Tickets Between Cities: $160 (Tokyo-Kyoto & Himeji-Hiroshima Shinkansen, local fares via Suica for all other trains)
   * Daily Expenses: $630 (food, sight admissions, Metro/bus/tram fares, shopping, etc.)

**Closing Thoughts:**

Overall, great experience! I would happily return to Japan and explore Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku, etc. Thank you to the people of Japan for making an American feel welcome!

travel,1jrdnvl,7 days in Taiwan,"First time visiting Taiwan that kicked off a 5 week trip in Eastern Asia. Had never been before, and had really only heard about Taipei. Overall I'm a huge fan, it's a beautiful and lush.  The people are so dang friendly. We were there during a mini heat wave at the end of February, very humid! Made walking around and hiking a little unpleasant but totally worth it in the end. Our plans might seem a bit random but I wanted to get a couple of days without being inundated with crowds, so skipped some of the more famous landmarks outside of Taipei (ex Sun Moon Lake) in favor of meandering through the NE portion of the country for day 5 & 6. Was def our shit, but required a rental car (not a big deal, driving in Taiwan is pretty straightforward). 

Itinerary: 

- Day 1-3: Spent 3 days in Taipei. We stayed in a quiet neighborhood about 2 blocks from the Confusious Temple Complex, worked well for us. Really liked doing the Maokong Gondola and all of the night markets. So much good food in Taipei! 

- Day 4: Rented a car and spent one day making our way over to Jiufen. We spent the first half of the day at Yangmingshan National Park which was a highlight, lot of cool things to see and easy to get around by car. Then went to Houtong Cat Village (meh) and ended at Jiufen. Spending the night felt key there, really enjoyed walking around in the evening without the gridlock crowds. 

- Day 5: Drove along Highway 2 on the coast to Bitoujiao Trail, nice hike that delivers 360 views along the coast. Highly recommend! After we made our way to South to cycle the Old Caoling Tunnel, unique experience that's also worth doing! An old train tunnel that has been converted into a cycling path, goes 4 km and was a nice way for us to escape the heat. Finished our day by making our way to Luodong, spent the night there. Great day!

- Day 6: Slowly made our way back to the Taipei area via Hwy 7, a very lonely, winding mountain road that cuts across the country. Its was a bit impulsive to do it but it was very scenic, not sure I'd recommend for most people though. We love roadtripping so great for us. We stopped at tea gardens and overlooks, the Yixing Suspension Bridge in particular was an unexpected highlight! Ended at Daxi for the night, nice town with a memorable old street.

Day 7: Made our way back to Taipei and flew out to the next stop on our adventure! Can't wait to return one day, beautiful island! ",614,0.99,9,2025-04-04 14:46:38,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jrdnvl,chokemypinky
travel,1jzeo44,I did the Turkish airlines stopover and compiled all the information so you don't have to,"I'm a 27yo solo female traveler who recently did the Turkish Airlines stopover program. I've compiled a list of information because I found the process quite confusing and unclear. 

**What is it?** Turkish airlines offers free hotel accommodation in Istanbul, if your connection period is at least 20 hours. If you are economy class, they offer a 4-star hotel, and 5-star for business class. 

**How do you do it?** 

1. First you need to select a flight that has at least 20 hours of transit time between the two flights. I was flying from Norway to Australia, so having a stopover in a nice hotel seemed like a good option before a 20-hour long haul. I felt this program seemed a little too good to be true, or gimmicky, but decided to try it out anyway. After purchasing your flight, you can email the airline [FREEHOTELAUSTRALIA@THY.COM](mailto:FREEHOTELAUSTRALIA@THY.COM) to book the hotel of your choosing. Here is a list of the hotels they offer for economy:

* Armada Hotel İstanbul
* Eresin Hotels Topkapı
* Grand Cevahir Hotel
* Grand Yavuz Hotel
* Ramada Plaza by Wyndham İstanbul Ataköy 
* Sheraton İstanbul Ataköy Hotel
* Vialand Palace Hotel
* Wish More Hotel Şişli
* Wish More Hotel Bayrampaşa

2. They send you a booking slip to complete, and you fill in your flight number, details, and departure information. **Specify which hotel you want to stay in before you submit the booking slip.** I did not specify, and was put in a random hotel not on the list, which was a little far out from the city. This felt a bit sneaky, as there is nowhere on the booking slip that let's you choose the hotel. If I was to do this again, I would get written confirmation there is availability at the hotel of your choosing, and then submit the booking slip with the hotel of your choosing clearly listed in the email and on the booking slip. I was unable to change my hotel, and the customer service team were very unhelpful. This is a hidden condition in their policy: ""The hotel voucher cannot be changed after it has been issued by the system."" I ended up staying in the Dedeman hotel, and it was pretty average. I think people were smoking in the hotel, as it smelt like musty cigarettes, and the location was not great. You can book a hotel as a group or family - they will accommodate you in the same room. 

3. Once you have received the booking slip, you do not need to contact the hotel to book anything. I just showed up on the day and they had a room booked for me. The airline will not organise any transport for you. Istanbul airport is quite far from the city centre, and a taxi fare is expensive. I took the metro (M11), and it was great. I would highly recommend utilising the public transport to and from the airport, it's reliable, cheap and I felt very safe travelling at night. 

4. **Organise your e-visa.** Not to be confused with a Turkish 'transit visa' (this is unrelated to any stopover or short-stay in Türkiye). You are required to apply for an electronic visa, which was more expensive than I anticipated (yes I should have checked first, but hindsight is bliss - hence this post). My total costs of my visa were USD$66.00 (AUD$104.29). 

**Perks:** Hotel was nice-ish, good inclusions (breakfast was amazing - so much food, gym), lovely staff, check in and check out was convenient for me and they held onto my luggage so I could explore the city. Exploring Istanbul in 22 hours was really fun! Hotels have discounted prices for Stopover passengers. If you want to extend your stay, you can contact the Hotel and get information about the special prices for Stopover passengers.

**Cons:** Expensive e-visa, confusing booking process and inflexibility to change hotel voucher, average hotel far from the city centre - I ended up spending quite a bit on taxis. 

**Miscellaneous tips:** If you are a solo female traveler, I would **not** stay on the European side. I was on this side and it felt a bit sketchy being alone at night, and there appears to be more petty crime. It's also a bit gridlocked taking a taxi from the European side to the Asian side. However, I felt quite safe in Istanbul generally, and just used common sense. Kadıköy feels very safe at night - would recommend exploring nightlife in this region. Turkish airlines offers **student discounted flights.** Register your status as a student in your Miles & Smiles account (provide student ID) and when you search for a flight, select 'Student' as the passenger. Some flights offer student seats which were really affordable! 

**TLDR:** The Turkish Airlines stopover program feels like a gimmick. Once you pay for the e-visa, food, transport etc. the 'money saved' from the free hotel outweighs the money spent. I might do the stopover again, if I could choose my hotel and it was more central.",604,0.95,41,2025-04-15 00:36:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jzeo44/i_did_the_turkish_airlines_stopover_and_compiled/,negomi_69
travel,1jpr45a,Spring skiing trip to Switzerland 🇨🇭,"We went to Andermatt-Sedrun-Disentis, Zermatt and Wengen Jungfrau region. It’s absolutely amazing experiencing the Swiss mountain infrastructure in winter. The views were incredible everywhere, we were above the clouds many times. The highlight was definitely skiing from Matterhorn Glacier Paradise to Cervinia in Italy. And skiing from Mannlichen down toward Grindelwald valley. We ended the trip with a few days back in the city exploring Lucerne, Zurich and Basel. 

While Switzerland is the most expensive European destination for skiing (and snow conditions were pretty average or poor overall) the views and easy transportation experience made it 100% worth it. 

Hope this report helps anyone trying to plan a ski trip to Switzerland! Happy to answer any questions. 

**Day 1-2 Andermatt:**
Flew into Zurich and took a train to Andermatt. The next day we skied **Andermatt-Sedrun-Disentis**, a series of interconnected resorts. Lots of traversing but a nice variety of views along the way which got better toward Disentis. Taking the train back from Disentis was also a unique experience. It is on the Glacier Express route, so it’s pretty special to experience that section between Andermatt and Disentis both on the mountain and in the valley. Andermatt the old town itself is very quiet, we stayed in the new town which also seemed empty (partly under construction and only a few shops and restaurants open at the moment - but it’s funded by Vail so I think they will develop it into a shopping/apres village). For dinner we had raclette and Swiss mac and cheese at **Oschen**. Swiss mac and cheese is a must try - they add potatoes and crispy fried onions, and serve it with a side of applesauce. 

**Day 3-5 Zermatt:**
Took the train from Andermatt to Zermatt, which also follows the Glacier Express route. On the first day in Zermatt we didn’t ski but took the **Gornergrat** train up the mountain. Had lunch on the outdoor terrace of **Alphitta** with the view of the Matterhorn (great vibes with live music). We got super lucky with mostly clear weather, and occasional clouds. On the second day we headed straight for **Matterhorn Glacier Paradise** and skied into **Cervinia**. It was incredible. Make sure you go up the viewing platform at the top station before heading into Italy. Had lunch in Italy and skiied back. The next day we started from **Sunnegga** funicular to go to **Rothorn** side, which had incredible views as well, but still went over to Italy for lunch because the food is great and cheap. Our favorite was **Chalet Etoile** which is self-serve with great pastas, and a large outdoor sun deck. 

**Day 7 Wengen, Lauterbrunnen, Murren, Schilthorn:**
This was a big travel day from Zermatt to Wengen, after dropping our luggage at the hotel we did a day trip up to **Schilthorn**. Started by taking the cable car from **Lauterbrunnen** to **Grutschalp**, train to **Mürren**, then walked through Murren to the other cable car station to go to **Schilthorn**. While it was cloudy in the valley, Schilthorn was above the clouds and stunning! It was like being on an airplane. We saw lots of skiers going down the mountain. Got to sit in the rotating restaurant and eat an ice cream. There’s still a lot of construction now, when it’s all done it will be a much better experience. For the way back down we took the cable car to **Stechelberg** and bus back to Lauterbrunnen through the valley.

**Day 8 Grindelwald-First, Kleine Scheidegg:**
We lucked out with a beautiful sunny day skiing above the clouds. Took the cable car from Wengen to **Mannlichen** and skiied partway down to **Grindelwald**, and then we went up to **First**. With the ski pass you can ride on First Glider/Rider for free, there was no line, so we did that, so much fun! However most of the lower mountain has no snow so we did not do a lot of skiing (but the views are worth it). Then took the **Eiger Express** up to **Eigergletscher** and skiied some more. Had lunch at **Restaurant Grindelwaldbleck** (rosti, weisswurst, beer and chocolate cake — all delicious). All in all it was an amazing day with incredible views throughout. Saw many locals up on the mountain that day. 

**Day 9 Kleine Scheidegg:**
Second ski day was snowing and wet without any views but some nice powder runs in the morning around Kleine Scheidegg and Mannlichen. Eventually the visibility got really bad with full whiteout conditions. In hindsight we were very very lucky on all our prior ski days for the clear weather. We skiied to Brandegg to try the apple donuts at the **Bergrestaurant Brandegg**, but otherwise finished the ski day early. 

**Day 10 Lucerne:**
After a long time up in the mountains it was nice to return to the city and lake side. Spring was in full swing at Lucerne with flowers blooming and warmer weather. We took a ferry to **Vitznau**, then a bus and train back toward Lucerne. Attended a concert at KKL and then cooked dinner at home with pesto, ravioli, chicken and wine from **Coop** (which was surprisingly tasty, one of our best meals!)

**Day 11 Zurich and Basel**
Went to Zurich in the morning and had breakfast at **Confiserie Sprungli**. Visited **Lindt Home of Chocolate**. Then spent the afternoon at the **Hurlimannbad & Spa** (much needed relaxation to end our trip). For the evening we went to **Basel**, explored the riverfront and town, had chocolate cake and hot cocoa at **Xocolatl** and had dinner at **Markthalle (Flavors of Jerusalem).** 

Tips:
- We bought a Half Fare Card and Saver Day Passes to save money on trains. Got the discount to go up Schilthorn for only $50 per person
- We managed just fine bringing our own skis onto all the trains. This saved a lot of money and time from renting at each resort. The hotels usually have spaces to store your skis (or offer a free ski depot nearby).
- Budget lots of time for sit down restaurants (they can take forever, especially dinner). Otherwise just get simple food from cafeterias or to-go options if you want to spend more time sightseeing and exploring (and save some money)
- If you can afford it book a hotel with a wellness spa, or a room with a bathtub, if you are skiing
- Check which days things are open or closed. A lot of stuff is closed on Sundays, but also sometimes Monday or Tuesday. ",593,0.98,15,2025-04-02 15:16:01,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jpr45a,sirotan88

travel,1jjwmcl,"PSA: There is a difference between ""Customs"" and ""Immigration""","PSA: There is a difference between ""customs"" and ""immigration""

I have been noticing a LOT of people confusing the two, with posts like ""will I get stopped at customs if I don't have a proper visa""

I think this is because now for the first time in a long time people from countries with strong passports are having to get some sort of clearance before entering other countries (e.g. ETIAS) and since they've never faced it before, are getting confused

Immigration/Passport Control: This is where your passport and visa are checked, allowing you to enter the country. It is a check of whether the *person* has the correct documents to enter the country and the passenger may or may not be allowed to enter.

Before you get here, you are still ""air side"" and are not considered to have entered the country. 

Immigration happens first before customs.

Customs: This is where your luggage is checked for banned/controlled/taxable substances and they determine whether you need to declare goods/throw something out/pay taxes before leaving the airport. Customs usually has a ""green channel"" (you have no controlled/taxable substances to declare) and a ""red channel (you DO have substances to declare)

Usually immigration tends to have a longer line than customs (depends on the country of course)

  
I know this is a very rudimentary post so mods apologies if this is not allowed but I noticed that MANY people were getting confused between the two so putting it out there!",544,0.94,43,2025-03-25 22:40:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jjwmcl/psa_there_is_a_difference_between_customs_and/,Pinkjasmine17

I'm just sad that it's not affordable anymore during summer. In the winter it's a bit less expensive, but who want to go to the beach in the winter anyway?

travel,1k0nolw,"A week in St. Lucia, a review","My gf and I went to Saint Lucia for a week this past New Year’s. I did a lot of my research by reading through old posts in this sub so I figured I’d write something up in case someone will find it useful in the future.

**Hotel**

We decided to stay in the Soufriere area in the south of Saint Lucia the entire time after reading about people who split their time between north and south preferring the south. Stayed at Samfi Gardens just north of Soufriere town (found from this sub). The room was a bit dated and the drive to/from the hotel every day was a bit rough (literally), but honestly not much to complain about – it was very reasonably priced and the view was *insane* (Photos 1 and 2 were taken from our balcony in the room and Photo 3 is of the hotel grounds). Everyone was super nice, the outdoor space was cool, comfy bed, cold A/C, etc. I’d def recommend the hotel overall.

**Transportation**

After reading about how bad the roads were, we decided not to rent a car and just take taxis / local drivers everywhere. This ended up costing a lot and if you want to save money and rent a car, I get it. But we do not regret our decision. The roads are *bad*. Even the roads that are decent quality pavement are super narrow with dropoffs, steep, lots of blind turns, and if you’re coming from the US you’d also be driving on the opposite side of the road. Some roads like the road from Soufriere to Jade Mountain / Anse Chastanet are probably the worst roads I’ve ever been on in my life – more pothole than road. I would have had a heart attack if I was driving.

Shout out to Swanson, Devon, and Whitney of Golden Ticket SLU who drove us to/from the airport and on a few pre-planned excursions around town, and also Nico and Toyan from Big T Taxi (recommended by the hotel) for more of the to/from dinner or to/from the beach kind of trips. Everyone communicates via Whatsapp and is super responsive.

**Food**

We went to a variety of places, from hole in the wall local places to resort restaurants. A lot of the food was very similar - fish or chicken with a large assortment of small sides that came with the protein. Most of it was very good, but nothing to write home about. There were two main outliers in my opinion.

Treetop Restaurant was incredible. An Indian multi-course menu in an outdoor restaurant set in a labyrynth of wooden patios and staircases up in the trees. The food was excellent, the mixologist made two amazing and very different cocktails just based off descriptions of what we liked, and the vibe was great. It was an awesome, very unique experience. Photo 4 was taken from our table.

On the other end of the spectrum, we were very excited for Rabot Restaurant at Hotel Chocolat and saved it for the last night of our trip. We already had lunch at a different place at the resort (included with the Tree to Bar tour where we made our own chocolate) and that was great, so our expectations were high. It turned out to be easily the worst meal of our trip, while also being the most expensive. Maybe we didn’t order the right things, but practically every part of the meal was just straight up bad, including the drinks.

**Sightseeing**

This was our first Caribbean island, and I picked it because I wanted to have stuff to do besides just laying on the beach.

We did a private ""Waterfall Chasing"" excursion with Father Nature. This didn’t get off to a great start as the guy asked if we were up for a tough hike and we said sure! I proceeded to completely eat it down a wet and slippery slope about 15 min in. I guess I assumed a tough hike would still have somewhat of a real path, and wouldn’t need to be hacked with a machete. Thankfully we decided to quit while we were behind and he took us on two much more chill and shorter hikes to two beautiful waterfalls (photos 5 and 6). Not only did we not see a single other tourist on either of these hikes, we didn’t see a single other person period. Hung out at the end destinations for a while, took a dip, ate a coconut. It was very cool, felt like we were really out there.

We did a ""Explore Soufriere"" day with Golden Ticket SLU where they drove us around to all the nature sites near Soufriere - all pretty close to each other and very doable in one day:

* Tet Paul Nature Trail (Photos 7, 8): Shockingly great views given how easy and short the hike was. Plus some friendly kitties at the top.
* Sulphur Springs / Mud Baths: Unique experience but insanely crowded and you’re herded like cattle along with bus-fulls of cruise ship passengers on day trips to the south.
* Toraille Waterfall: Really large waterfall that you can get under. Unfortunately, ditto with the tourists, it was super packed. Honestly, not worth it.
* Diamond Falls Botanical Gardens (Photos 9, 10): Pretty botanical gardens that you walk through for a little while until you reach the waterfall - can’t get under this one, the water is gray from the sulphur, but it’s very cool looking. Much less touristy.
* Piton Falls (Photo 12): The water is warm! We hung out in the pools for a while, there were very few people.

We did a private half day sailing excursion with Mystic Man on a beautiful 40 foot sailboat. We were considering the group sunset one, but very happy we went with the private one, especially since we were able to move the start time later in the day to catch the sunset on our way back anyway. The guys were great, took us up the coast a bit before turning around and going to Sugar Beach to snorkel. When we first set off, they were gonna go direct to Sugar Beach but I asked if we could take a more roundabout way so I could get a photo of the Pitons from a specific angle in the water that I wanted (Photo 13) and they were super chill about it. Neither of us had been snorkeling before (and I can’t swim) so I was nervous, but the guys were patient and showed us how to do everything. It was expensive but 100% worth it, probably the highlight of the trip. Also the rum punch was flowing and they gave us a bottle of sparkling wine to take with us since we never cracked it open on the boat.

As far as beaches go, we did Sugar Beach and Anse Chastanet / Anse Mamin beaches. Sugar Beach was spectacular visually being between the Pitons (Photos 15 and 16) so I’m definitely glad we went. But it was super crowded, you couldn’t rent chairs if you weren’t staying there, and there was very little shade otherwise. We only stayed for a few hours. Anse Chastanet and Anse Mamin were much better imo. We rented snorkeling gear and snorkeled at Anse Chastanet, then walked \~10 min along the coast to Anse Mamin (Photo 17), had a very expensive but delicious burger at Jungle Grill, rented two chairs under a palapa with no issue, and chilled the rest of the day. Very few people in comparison to Sugar Beach and the snorkeling was better too. We liked this day so much we went back and repeated it on our last day.

I’m really leaning towards splurging on staying at the Esperanza and getting one of the nicer rooms for 6 nights, but it definitely would be like a huge hit to our bank account. We wouldn’t go into debt or clean out our savings or anything like that, but it would just sort of be like “damn we better enjoy this”. We also have decent jobs and make a good monthly income so we could recoup it if we hunkered down on savings for a few months 

I go back and forth in my head about doing it, I’m leaning towards doing it because the thought I keep coming to is “am I gonna regret not going or am I gonna regret spending the money in 10 years?” And I know the answer to that question is regretting not going 

How do you feel about all this? How do you weigh your travel/vacations with your finances? 

Should I just say fuck it and go? Or really consider if it’s worth it?

travel,1jskg1d,Does anyone find South America unironically more expensive than Europe?,"After having been in these two continents, I was overviewing my expenses in both of them and I realize I actually tend to spend more in South America compared to Europe.  Some of my observations so far:

1. Public transport in Europe is so good.  I can get from places to places so easily just from a quick Google Maps search to find the next available train.  In much of South America, I still have to depend on taxis, tour buses and domestic fights to get from location to location.  I know there are metros in the major cities in South America as well, but it gets a bif iffy sometimes so I still feel more secure taking a taxi in these cities.  This is sort of linked to my second point.
2. It's of no surprise that crime levels in South America is quite a lot higher compared to Europe.  This means that for unexperienced travelers, you might want to pay for private tours to do certain activities if you don't want to be constantly on the lookout.  Europe has it's fair share of pickpockets, but by and large I still find it quite comfortable walking down the streets as long as I keep my belongings secured with me.
3. I also find the general prices of things in South America, in the places tourists will go, tend to be quite on par with Europe.  For example in Rio, I find most of the restaurants along Copacabana and Ipanama at about USD20-25 per pax, which is really not all that different from central London and Paris.  I know you can probably find more affordable prices the further you stray from the tourists places, but the areas start to get shady quite quickly which again goes back to my second point.

Just some of my 2cents.  Really interested to see what other people who's being to both of these regions think.",374,0.79,228,2025-04-06 02:54:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jskg1d/does_anyone_find_south_america_unironically_more/,Xycergy
travel,1jseef8,UK ETA: Beware!,"I recently traveled to the UK with my mom, and although I am an EU citizen, she isn’t. We ran into an unexpected issue with Ryanair that I figured was worth sharing.

As most of us already know, as of this year, any non-UK citizens need to apply for a UK ETA before traveling. We did that for my mom, and her application was approved quickly. The confirmation email clearly stated:

**”When you travel to the UK 
You only need your passport that ends in 0000. 
You do not need to print or show this confirmation email.""**

Sounds simple, right? Well, not according to Ryanair.

Right before boarding our flight to London, Ryanair staff insisted on seeing the ETA confirmation email, claiming it was mandatory. My mom doesn’t have an EU SIM card, so no mobile data to check her emails. To make things worse, she had applied using her work email and didn't realize it at first. Cue 15 minutes of panic while Ryanair refused to let us board.

We finally found the email just in time, but the whole ordeal could have been avoided if we had just saved a copy in advance. So, lesson learned: keep that ETA email handy, as the airline staff might ask for it, even if the UK government says you don't need it.

DISCLAIMER: I understand the reasoning behind requesting this documentation before boarding, and that it is probably a procedure followed by all airlines. Still, it contradicts the official ETA statement so I thought it was worth sharing.

Safe travels!

travel,1jzmr2a,A month in Maldives,"Stayed on Hulhumale BnB for a month, an island connected to the main capital island - Malé. But we went back and forth to other islands like Maafushi and Sun Siam.

The captial island is a constant construction zone, especially in Hulhumale which is less than two decades old. Also if you're coming during March, the main islands will have closures due to Ramadan (EVERYTHING CLOSES, INCL/ PUBLIC BUSES). Outside of March most shops/public bus normally are closed periodically for scheduled prayer times. On tourists islands like Maafushi/etc, everything is open.

There are two movie theaters on the main island, one on each island with only a single room for showings. There’s a reservation requirement of 10-30pax to show. The public transportation is mostly double decked buses that take Visa/ Mastercard tap-to-pay feature (1USD). The buses travel both the islands, with interesting rules such as not being able to board the bus without walking through the station (Maafannu Bus Terminal).
Hulhumale is a newer island that has only existed for a few decades. As Malé is rapidly sinking, this will be its replacement. There are two major parts of Hulhumale, Phasel and Phase2. Phase1: Houses 1-5 story houses with restaurants and businesses below. Phase2 is completely left for locals, with high rises created to help with the housing crisis Maldives faces. 

All in all, interesting place.

travel,1jzz6xs,Air France's bogus reasoning for changing our seats,"A little rant. My husband and I had booked a business class flight on Air France from Paris to Singapore. We fly often (not always in business class) but I always choose a window seat. I had as usual made sure to select a window seat when we made the booking for this trip. My husband had booked the window seat behind me. I arrive on the plane and automatically go to the A seats (Window). I knew we had ""A"" seats but were not sure of the numbers so I checked my boarding pass. Lo and behold, it says E, a middle seat. My husband had the seat next to mine, F. The layout of the seats was as follows. A seats, then aisle, E and F seats then aisle, then L seats. A and L are the window seats.

I know in business class a window seat should not matter much like in economy, but I like to take pictures from the window so I was a little miffed. I flagged down a flight attendant and explained that I was pretty sure we had booked window seats and did not understand why it had been changed. He says he was going to look into it and get back to me. He comes back two minutes later and says they changed our seats to accomodate a mother and child. We had booked seats 3A and 4A. I look there and see there is a woman and an older  boy on ""our"" seats . The boy looked to be maybe 15 years . 

Thad did not help me feel better about losing my window seat. What is the logic here? When you say you want to accomodate a mother and her child, I assume you want to seat them together? The mother was now seated behind the child. Could have been understandable if people had been moved to have them seat side by side like in the middle seats. I imagine they just said they wanted window seats and their wish was granted. Not a good enough reason (for me anyways) to displace others who also preferred window seats. Hell, I would have understood maybe if it was a much younger child who was excited to have a window seat. Anyway, maybe I am overreacting. Do you think this was justified?",335,0.85,58,2025-04-15 18:25:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jzz6xs/air_frances_bogus_reasoning_for_changing_our_seats/,omtenksom_jente

travel,1jjsxtj,My thoughts after two weeks in Colombia,"I just spent about 16 days in Colombia with my partner and wanted to get my thoughts out about the trip. I hate saying it, but I don’t think I enjoyed the trip as much as I expected. I still had lots of fun, but found the trip to be a bit exhausting at times. I’d describe it overall as dynamic, with lots of ups and downs. I'm wondering if other people can relate, give advice, or have recs for some other places I should try traveling to! Sorry this ended up so long. 

TL;DR - Colombia was a pretty intense trip. I loved the local people and some travelers, the food, and the nature, but found it to be somewhat overwhelming. It wasn't too expensive, but I found myself regretting various bookings or purchases throughout the trip. Wondering if I am not outgoing enough for the country, but overall still had a great time. 

Anyways, here are the positives to start:

**POSITIVES**

NATURE

Eje Cafetero is probably the most beautiful place I’ve seen in my life. Combined with the wildlife in Tayrona and Playa Brava (I highly recommend Playa Brava over San Juan) the outdoors here were just astounding. As a wonderful man in Munich once said to me, “My heart goes out to \[insert place\].” For me that place was Salento. Even if it didn’t have the amazing Valle de Cocora, the rolling hills and tall grass here are things to marvel at and enjoy the serenity in. Extremely happy we spent a decent chunk of time here. Plus, there were tons of beautiful birds to watch. 

PEOPLE

Both Colombian people and many of the travelers we met were some of the nicest people I’ve met on a trip. It was easier for me to approach people and start conversations than probably any other place for me except maybe the Camino de Santiago. When I spoke with our hostel hosts in Spanish, they were always patient, kind, and very willing to help me practice. This part of Colombian culture truly stands out. People almost always meet you with a smile and you feel the warmth of the people around you. 

FOOD

Many people seem to complain about the food, but I actually liked quite a few of the meals we had. It took some time to find the rights spots here and there, but when we did, the freshness and simplicity was great. Lean into eating sopa, lots of juice, and chicharron. The menu del dia was our friend and we could often split one. Plus, the coffee was fantastic, cheap, and didn’t give me jitters. I don’t know how that’s possible, but it’s what happened (could be a lot of Robusta coffee at the shops back home?). 

HOSTELS (some of them)

Yambolombia in Salento may be my favorite hostel ever. It’s 30 minutes out of town walking, but the atmosphere and tranquility were unmatched. Plus it is cheap, the people are incredibly kind, and you can walk to the coffee fincas very easily from there. The Valle Tayrona hostel was probably the coolest hostel I’ve seen. You’re kinda in a jungle and everything is made of bamboo and it’s eco friendly. 

MEDELLIN

Medellin again felt somewhat chaotic for me, but I found it to be very cool. An amazing mix of history, cool neighborhoods, and loving people. We stayed near Laureles and I think that was my favorite area to wander. I recommend seeing Comuna 13, doing a walking tour of the Centro, checking out some museums, and just meandering. The Centro felt a bit sketchy at times, but nothing too crazy. Just watch yourself, don't stand in sketchy areas too long, and listen to the locals if they tell you not to hang out somewhere. 

**NEGATIVES**

I want to preface this by saying that none of this is a reflection on the country of Colombia or its people, but rather a reflection of my experience and possibly some ill-founded expectations. There’s also a factor of comparison involved. A year ago my partner and I went to Japan where we found nearly everything to be extremely convenient and orderly, which made our trip relaxing but also exciting as we got to focus more on fun rather than figuring things out. I speak some Spanish which helped a ton, but I definitely felt out of control for decent chunks of this trip. 

WEALTH DISPARITY

This is just something that felt a little strange, especially in Cartagena and Medellín. It’s also my first time in a country with this much poverty, so that has an impact. Flying into Cartagena, the first thing we saw was comunas that looked very poor. I felt a bit odd in this very touristy area while knowing this isn’t the reality for most people living there. In Medellín, people talked about taking cable cars over poor neighborhoods. This could be powerful for understanding, but also could easily go in a very bad direction. These issues aren’t unique to Colombia, but it was new for me. I did appreciate that it seemed like the government of Medellín was trying to improve many things. I don’t live there so I can’t comment, but that was the revitalization energy expressed in many tours. 

CARTAGENA

Cartagena is a beautiful city (at least the small part that I saw), but it was sadly one of my least favorites cities I’ve visited. It’s extremely touristy, relatively expensive, and very hot. The streets in the walled city are so beautiful, I just wish they would shut some of them down to most traffic. The sidewalks are too small to walk next to someone and it can feel like you have to dodge stuff frequently. There are also constantly people asking you to buy things. I underestimated how much energy this would take out of me. With all that said, Cartagena at 6am when it’s quiet is a beautiful place. Plus, I highly recommend doing a snorkeling tour with the company Diving Planet if you’re willing to pay a bit more than the other Rosario tours. Easily a highlight of the trip for us and we didn’t want a party boat at 9am (or at all really). One last thing, we did a tour that included going to Alquimico and found it to be very overrated. Getsemaní was much cooler IMO. 

PRICES

Colombia is by no means expensive, but I found that the prices of things ranged dramatically and were generally higher than I anticipated. Sometimes you’d have nearly 10x buying power from the US. Other times things would cost the same. Anything with liquor was usually pretty rough. I also found it a bit harder to find quality budget options than in some other countries.

I didn’t fully realize this beforehand, but the frequent need for guides was a major expense. Even free tours asked to tip about the same I was asked in Europe, which I did. It felt like in order to do many of the fun things, you had to be willing to put down more cash than I expected. We wanted to see Barbas Bremen near Filandia but skipped it altogether because you had to have a guide and it was like $40 USD minimum per person from what I saw in about 30 minutes of searching. I get why they do it, but it was frustrating all the same.

Colombia was still quite cheap overall, just more expensive than I thought. These things combined to follow what some of our travel buddies often said: “the money flows like water here.”

NOISE

People often said to us that Colombians like things very loud. Idk if that’s universally the case, but it was definitely the experience we had a lot of the time. I don’t necessarily love the near absolute silence of Japan’s transit system, but I didn’t always appreciate people playing music or videos aloud in tight spaces or in transit. Music in restaurants and bars often made it hard to talk with people, I lost my voice a lot, and my partner couldn’t handle the volume period in certain places. This just wore us down over time. 

SCAMS AND VALUE

In Cartagena especially, we felt like we were getting *sort of* scammed a lot. Not like “oh we paid for a futbol game but they sold our ticket to someone else,” but more like we’d be rushed into a taxi, our shuttle to Santa Marta dropped us at a random spot filled with local taxis, the guide we bought was definitely not worth the price, etc. Much of this could have been remedied with more research, but I found many online guides for Colombia to be either outdated or inaccurate. Get Your Guide seems very hit or miss (even with very good ratings) and generally too expensive, but it was definitely harder for me to figure things out on my own here than other countries. Much of the time when we asked our hostel for help, they would direct us to tours that were just as, if not more expensive than Get Your Guide. If you want a solid online guide, I highly recommend checking out Tom Plan My Trip. It had some of the best info for us the entire journey. 

TOURISTS VS TRAVELERS 

There were a number of people we spent multiple days with and had a good time. Outside of these amazing groups, the tourist scene seemed very party focused. In Cartagena basically every customs booth has signs about illegal sex trafficking and sex tourism. Many people also just want to travel and get drunk, which is fine, but that wasn’t really our vibe. This may have been a big factor in why we didn’t super enjoy Cartagena. We met some great people, but the Viajero hostel was definitely a big party hostel. Being a party hostel is fine, but Hostelworld rankings in Colombia seem a bit skewed towards that style, so atmosphere ratings may need deeper consideration for some travelers. We had better luck later in the trip picking less popular, cheaper hostels (I was sort of kicking myself for not remembering this earlier). 

An annoying side note - Viajero Cartagena was charging 60,000 COP for a pub crawl that very well could have been free if they just allowed people to go and buy drinks on their own. I heard the first stop on the crawl was another Viajero which just feels like another *sort of* scam like I mentioned above. I recommend going to Palenque in Getsemaní for free instead. 

If people wanted to party, I’d hoped there’d be more people who wanted to grab a six pack and go sit on the wall of the walled city or find a place in a park. Then go to a club or bar after. Many people seemed perfectly happy to empty their wallets with watered-down $10 cocktails and overpriced pub crawls. Maybe I just picked the wrong hostel :(

**CONCLUSION**

Colombia felt a bit challenging as a couple who has some introverted tendencies. I try to push my comfort zone while traveling and I think I did okay, but the party scene is everywhere. I still feel incredibly lucky to have met the people we did. 

At the end of the day, I will remember the people and the nature. I would come back to Colombia, but maybe visit some smaller towns in the pacific or Santander, or maybe try Bogotá. I can’t tell if Colombian city culture was just too much for me. I tend to take things too seriously so it’s a good challenge for me to step back like this, but I’ve heard so many people rave about the country, I began to wonder if I wasn’t outgoing enough for it. It’s hard to tell if it’s something wrong with me or if it just wasn’t the right energy for my personality. I don’t know if there’s much I can do about that except continue trying to be open to new experiences. 

Anyways, thank you Colombia for the wonderful experience. I'd probably give the trip a 7.5/10.",308,0.88,122,2025-03-25 20:08:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jjsxtj/my_thoughts_after_two_weeks_in_colombia/,mrfawsta

travel,1jqkt5p,Day trip to Pompeii and Naples,"I spent a week in Rome with my family in February and we did a Wednesday day trip to Pompeii and Naples.   I have read that it can be a very long day,  if we did not find it to be too bad. 


We got on a train in Rome at 8:06am (I booked it a few weeks in advance and it was a LOT cheaper than if I booked the week of.  I think I saved over 100 euro on 4 tickets by doing so).  We arrived in Naples at 9:13 and had to transfer to the Circumvesiviana train line which is within the Napoli Centrale station, but it was about a 10-15 minute walk to find it. This train line is a much grittier local train line, we bought our tickets on the spot from a friendly English speaking guy in the ticket booth and found our platform. The train departed around 9:50ish. /‘d we arrived at Pompeii Scavi station around 10:25 and met our tour guide there (we found her through a recommendation in Rick Steves’ Rome book. 


We did a 2 hour tour with her which was excellent, then grabbed lunch right in the middle of the ruins up on a hill overlooking the ancient city. The food was good and there were a lot of options. 

The guide pointed out a way to get where which took us up some metal steps and over a metal catwalk that is under a tin roof that had all been erected over a section of the ancient city that is currently undergoing excavation. This was REALLY cool to see.  There were tons of buildings that have just been unearthed after 2000 years that were been cleaned, examined, catalogued etc. you could see the archeologists doing their work. No photos were permitted and there was a guy up there walking around to enforce that.  I was in Pompeii in 2000, so it was really neat to see this work being done now. 


After lunch we made our way back to the train and got on one around 1:45 to head back to  Naples.  We got to Naples around 2:15 and made our way to one of two apparently very famous Neopolitan pizza places that are across the street from each other. We ate at a place called Pizzeria Trianon (be careful there are knockoffs that try to use the same name).  By this time is was about 2:30, so the restaurant was empty except for about 5 other people (I have read that there can be lines out the door at peak times). We sat upstairs and ordered 2 pizzas which you can see in the photos and a bottle of their house red wine.  

It’s times like this that I wish I had a better way with words because I can’t tell you how good this pizza was.  The dough, crust, fresh ingredients ..  momma Mia. They are cooked in old school wood fired ovens, and that fire and heat really gives the pizza an amazing finish and flavor. 

We finished that and had a slow wander back to the train station and hopped on one around 5pm and were back in Rome by 6:15 or so.

My wife and kids loved Pompeii, it is a huge sight and you could literally spend the whole day wandering the streets and alleys if you wanted to. When I went there solo in 2000. 8 did just that. But this time with the kids, the time we spent was plenty, and using the tour guide was a good use of our time (cost 200 euro for 2 hours). When I was solo, I just just a guide book to show myself around at my own pace. But you definitely want a tour guide or a good book so you know what you are looking at. 

Naples was definitely very gritty, but it was a really neat contrast to Rome. No offense to any Italian friends reading this, but Naples smelled like urine in many places around the train station.  But honestly it added to the charm and it was good for the kids to see the rough edges of a really beautiful country. We never felt unsafe at any moment on the train or in the city. 

It was the perfect day trip to break up the week stay in Rome, and as you are on the train from Naples to Pompeii, you are looking out the window and all of a sudden you catch sight of the bay of Naples open up to one side and it’s a truly beautiful view of the bay and surrounding mountains.

travel,1jxpfuz,What exactly do people mean when they say a travel destination has become americanized/westernized?,"This is something that I have noticed in different comments, posts, and such on social media—that a travel destination has become more americanized/westernized.

Now, touristic cities (places that are catered and/or meant for tourists) are a thing. Like Cancun, as an example.

But, from what I've seen online, the places that people are describing as americanized/westernized are not really the tourism hot spots, but more so, places where either locals once were, or not a lot of tourism was in that area. As time went on, it gets to where there's less locals in said area, tourism increases, and the destination is basically not the same like before.

Now, there are a bunch of travel destinations I've seen described as being americanized/westernized. Places like Bali, Phuket, beach spots in Mexico (Tulum, Sayulita, Isla Mujeres, etc), the Amalfi Coast (for some reason), parts of Costa Rica, etc. I saw a comment state that The Bahamas feels like an extension of Florida, and people have stated how Aruba now feels more like the US.

Another thing I've noticed is that when people describe a travel destination as being more americanized/westernized, it seems to also be places where digital nomads, influencers, expats, entrepreneurs from other countries, etc, all thrive in.

Or even different nationalities. Bali, of course, having a lot of Australians. I even saw a comment where someone said they went to one area of Mexico and saw nothing but Canadians and Canadians flags in the there.

All that being said, what exactly do people mean when they say a travel destination has become americanized/westernized?

Is it:

-Overdevelopment (adding in a lot of hotels and resorts)

-Pricing (going from affordable to expensive)

-People moving in and causing gentrification

-Adding a fast food restaurant or place to the area (ex: someone going for a walk in the mountains and coming across a random Starbucks on the side)

-Having too many crowds

Or maybe even all of the above? Honestly, I'm curious to know the answers to this. And, for any one who has experienced a travel destination that later on became americanized/westernized, what were the signs that made you notice?",243,0.85,227,2025-04-12 19:35:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jxpfuz/what_exactly_do_people_mean_when_they_say_a/,Xftg123
travel,1jtmhpd,"What is your travel ""Superpower""?","My wife and I love traveling!  While packing for our last trips, we started talking about the advantages we had when packing, we both are smaller people, so we are able to pack more clothes in a smaller space, we called it a superpower.  It got me thinking, what are your travel superpowers and/or weaknesses?


Me:  

Superpower: 


-Smaller Frame - Can pack more clothes in smaller space or carry better with the same amount of stuff.  Can fit in most places, like smaller airplane seats, cram in to backseats, etc.  

-Sweat resistance - I rarely sweat, if I do, it's usually just my forehead.  I don't use/carry anti-perspirant.  I don't sweat through my clothes, they stay fresher longer.  I do get heat rash though where I should be sweating.  

-Heat tolerance - I am comfortable with higher heat, I can easily wear pants up to 80 degrees Fahrenheit, rarely wear shorts.  


Weaknesses: 

-Cold intolerance - I get cold very easily, once it gets in to the sixties, I'd like at least a hoodie.  

-Constant Hunger - I'm always hungry.  At home, I'm near food and snacks, so that's not a big deal, but traveling, I seem to never pack enough snacks.  Thank goodness for my metabolism.  

-Constant bathroom breaks - I guess having to pee all the time is the crux of good hydration, but it's inconvenient.  


I'm interested to hear what your powers are!",228,0.87,403,2025-04-07 14:24:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jtmhpd/what_is_your_travel_superpower/,igotalotofrice
travel,1jryz0r,Naples - what’s going on?,"First time here and I’d heard a million times that it was a bit run down & grubby etc., but I was shocked to see the state of large areas of the city centre. I’m Scottish and it reminded me of Edinburgh during the bin strikes 3 or so years ago - 8 foot high piles of rubbish everywhere. Even saw some decomposing rats lying around that had clearly been there for weeks. Was a full-time job trying to avoid standing on dog shit as well. Assuming it was dogs! One guy also definitely trying to get me to take my hands out of my pockets in an attempt to rob me, I’m in no doubt about that. It wasn’t happening, though. 

I took plenty of advice from various people to find the ‘nice’ parts, but we wandered around those areas for a couple of hours and it was terrible. 

Has it gone downhill recently, or has it always been like this?

Any further advice on some decent areas with nice bars etc. would be welcome. We only have tonight left and we’d like to try enjoy it as best we can. Had a great dinner last night so wasn’t a total write-off, but after it certainly was. I’d rather not go out than wander around these areas again.

travel,1k2vs07,Backpacking Iraq (South to North) in 2025,"We’re two European guys in our 30s  and we decided to explore Iraq without a guide or a tour.

Getting in:
We flew to Kuwait, spent a day there, and then crossed the land border on foot. At the time, it was still possible to get a visa on arrival at the southern border crossing.

Our Route:

Basra – Spent a day here. Not much to see, but the corniche was pleasant, and we had an incredible local meal in a meat restaurant. Stayed overnight.

Mesopotamian Marshes – Took a shared taxi to the marshes. We had a boat tour arranged via a WhatsApp contact for 10,000 IQD each (others in person quoted us $50!). The guy was incredibly friendly—one of many helpful people we’d meet.

Nasiriyah – Continued on the same day and visited the Ziggurat of Ur—easily one of the highlights of the trip. Slept in the city.

Najaf – Visited the holy shrines and the world's largest cemetery. Despite the language barrier, a former soldier we befriended in the taxi took us around with Google Translate. Highly recommend having the app ready—not many you'll meet will speak English, but many are eager to connect.

Karbala – Arrived the same day and visited the shrines in the evening. The atmosphere was very emotional and we happened to see a few funerals.

Babylon / Hilla – The next morning, we visited Babylonia and Saddam’s abandoned palace, then headed to Baghdad.

Baghdad – Spent two nights. Visited the main highlights, including the Iraq Museum. Military and police presence is strong but we never felt unsafe. My friend wanted to drink... So we found alcohol in hole-in-the-wall shops—bars listed on Google Maps were mostly closed. One funny moment: a police truck rolled by while we were buying drinks and everything shut down in seconds.

Samarra – Left early the next day. At a checkpoint in the city, we were told we needed an escort (safety?) but the ""helpers"" tried to scam us. We ended up walking in on our own. The mosque and spiral minaret were breathtaking 

Mosul – Visited another, lesser-known minaret en route (Abu dulaf, a bit scary to climb if you’re afraid of heights!). Reached Mosul before dark. Next day exploring on foot was an emotional experience—seeing the bullet-ridden walls and post-war reconstruction, yet life carrying on. Playing games with local kids was a heartwarming highlight.

Erbil (Kurdistan) – Arrived in the evening. It felt like a different country—modern, clean, and somewhat reminiscent of Eastern European cities. We went out in the Christian quarter and enjoyed our final night.


Tips & Insights:

People were unbelievably friendly and curious about us. We met many schoolkids who wanted to practise English and take selfies with us.

Tourism is still minimal. The few tourists we saw were in big organised tours and we kept running into the same groups.

Shared taxis are super cheap (usually $5–10 per person) and we were always charged local prices.

Hotels are way cheaper if booked in person. Prices online were often double or triple. We paid $35–45 USD/night on average for a double room; the most we paid was $55 in a fancier place.

Food is generous and meat-heavy. Meals were $5–10 with huge portions and tons of starters—don’t expect to be hungry afterwards.

In total we spent around 500 USD per person for a week (everything included)

Language is a barrier, but nothing Google Translate can’t handle.

Careem (taxi app) can be useful but it doesn't work in every region.

If you’ve ever been curious about Iraq, it’s a country full of surprises, history, and heart. We were overwhelmed by the hospitality and blown away by the richness of the experience.

travel,1jq7frm,Saudi Airlines rescheduled my flight by a full week with just 2 days notice - What compensation am I entitled to and how can I pursue it?,"Hello r/travel !

I'm in a stressful situation with Saudi Airlines (Saudia) and could really use some advice from anyone with similar experiences or knowledge about passenger rights.

Flight Details:
Original Booking: Round trip from Frankfurt to Mumbai

Outbound Flight: Frankfurt → Jeddah → Mumbai (Completed on February 27th)

Original Return Flight: Mumbai → Riyadh → Frankfurt (Scheduled for April 4th, 2025)

Rescheduled Return: Now changed to April 11th, 2025 (7-day delay)

Notification Timing: Received email on April 2nd at 20:06 (less than 48 hours before original departure)

Ticket Cost: Approximately €300 for the round trip + €60 add-on fee

Why This Is Problematic:
As a working professional, this one-week delay is causing significant issues:
I've already arranged my work schedule around my original return date
My employer is expecting me back at work following the original date
I may face financial consequences due to missed work
I need to arrange/pay for additional accommodation in Mumbai for a week

Steps Taken So Far:
Immediately tried to contact their customer service after receiving the notification
Found their online customer service to be essentially non-existent
Attempted calling their customer service line and eventually they responded to contact the airlines office in person.
I'm currently on my way to their physical office in Mumbai to speak with someone in person.

What I Need Help With:
- What compensation am I legally entitled to for such a significant schedule change with minimal notice?
- Are there specific EU regulations that apply since my destination is Frankfurt?
- Can I demand they book me on another airline to get me home closer to my original date?
- Is anyone familiar with Saudi Airlines' specific policies for schedule changes?
- What documentation should I gather to strengthen my case?
- Should I accept the new flight and seek compensation, or refuse it and demand a refund?
- Has anyone successfully received compensation from Saudi Airlines in similar situations?
- Despite the low fare (which shouldn't affect my rights), this last-minute schedule change is significantly disrupting my professional and personal life. 

—> Any advice, personal experiences, or information about passenger rights in this situation would be immensely appreciated.

Thank you in advance for your help!

Edit:

Update & Thanks to Everyone!

Hey folks, just wanted to give you all an update and thank you for all the comments, advice, and suggestions you shared. Your support made a big difference in handling this situation!

So, here’s what happened: I managed to reach the Saudia Airlines office, but it wasn’t an easy task. Their office had changed its address, and neither their website nor Google Maps had the correct information. After some local asking around, I finally figured out their new location and headed there.

Once at the office, I presented all my arguments and concerns. However, they were extremely adamant about sticking to the rescheduled flight and almost forcing me to accept it. I stayed firm and pointed out that flights were available for earlier dates, even though they were business class. Unfortunately, they outright refused to upgrade me to business class despite my situation.

After lengthy discussions and a lot of back-and-forth, I finally managed to convince them to book me on a direct flight to Frankfurt with Lufthansa instead. While I’m relieved about this outcome, there’s a small downside: my upgraded baggage add-on (which I originally purchased) became null and void. They informed me that upgraded add-ons are non-refundable and refused to entertain any refund for that.

Still, considering how stressful this situation was, I’m grateful that it’s resolved, for the most part. I wouldn’t have been able to navigate this without all the helpful advice and encouragement I received here.

Thank you all again, I truly appreciate your time and support. Wishing you all the very best in life. Take care and goodbye!",214,0.92,31,2025-04-03 02:51:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jq7frm/saudi_airlines_rescheduled_my_flight_by_a_full/,NaiveCoder786
travel,1jufbrc,Do You Keep Your Travels Private?,"What I mean is that when you travel and take trips, do you like to tell your friends, family, and coworkers stories when you get back or that you’re going before you leave? Personally, I tend to keep my travels and trips private. Me and my family usually take a big week trip somewhere every year. I also love flying and I’ve taken a bunch of short solo day trips to places or trips literally just to fly around for fun.
I’ll tell my immediate family, but outside of that, I don’t like to tell my coworkers or friends or even post it on social media for fear of other people’s opinions.

Take for example my supervisor at work. He has traveled a ton and has so many stories and photos that he loves to share with me from his trips. As someone who also enjoys traveling and takes many trips, we both get along well enjoy sharing our travel stories. He’s the only coworker who I’ll tell. Right now he’s out of the office for a week as he’s in another country on yet another vacation. Some of my coworkers from another shift yesterday morning didn’t know he was on vacation or out of the country. When I told them, they kind of rolled their eyes and then proceeded to say that he travels all the time and his vacations are crazy. Basically, alluding to how they do a lot on their trips and try to see a lot. These other coworkers went on about how their ideal vacation is to go and lay out on the beach for a week and not to do a lot. My supervisor also has two kids (both are in their teens) and one of these coworkers made a comment about how basically his kids are spoiled to go on so many vacations every year.

It left a bad taste in my mouth and sort of reminded me why I don’t like to tell people about my travels. I tend to get two sides, the people who re opinionated and wonder why I went wherever or did whatever and then the other side of people who don’t seem interested or to care. Is it jealousy you think from other people? That’s at least what I tend to think.

Anyways, what’s your thoughts? Do you like to share your travels, or keep them to yourself for fear of others opinions?",202,0.87,168,2025-04-08 14:46:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jufbrc/do_you_keep_your_travels_private/,kgaviation

travel,1jz86wp,Airline rebooked my son's ticket without permission,"Hi All, I am hoping to get some advice if possible. My husband, my son and myself are booked to fly to South africa tomorrow from Edinburgh. My son, who booked his ticket separately to us, got a text today to say that he has been booked on a completely different flight from us due to overbooking. this puts a huge spanner in the works as we have a connecting flight from Jo'burg which he'll potentially miss as his new flight arrives a whole 12 hours after ours. We were advised to try on the day (tomorrow) to see if he can still get on the flight anyway (the original flight still shows as available on his KLM app as well as the new flight). The question I guess I have is, is it really worth it for my son to show up that early only to be told he can't fly? We really want to fly as a family, ideally, but I obviously don't want him to spend 24 hours on the road if he can;t get on. If anyone has had this happend to, what was your experience with trying to get on the original booking?  
Thanks ever so much!!

EDIT to say that I have already been on the phone to them, and even went to the airport! The airport KLM site was closed, and on the phone they told me there is nothing they can do as the flight was already rebooked as the original flight is overbooked and there are no available seats. She did say that there is a small chance he could still get on if there is a cancellation in the moring or a no-show, but I am wondering if it is worth it and what the chances are of him still getting on it.

EDIT 2: When we checked the KLM app just now (2 am), as well as just re-booking my son's flight, they now have also bumped my husband and myself from the seats we paid extra for due to 'operational reasons'. No way to call them at this hour, so we are just going to go to the airport at 3:30 am.

Thanks to everyone that has replied, the information was so useful, even if we can't get it sorted!!

EDIT 3: We all went to the airport at 3 am. Turns out that it was not the flight to Amsterdam that was overbooked, but the flight from Amsterdam to Johannesburg. They had already put my son on a British Airways flight and were not able to change that back, despite 6 available seats on the original flight popping up on the attendants screen 🙄​. We ended up all changing over to BA which means we'll arrive at 7 am tomorrow morning instead of 9 pm tonight. It's  going to be one long-ass trip until we get to our final destination tomorrow at 2 pm, as we all didn't get any sleep last night 😂 but at least we're all together. Here is hoping there won't be any delays for our connecting flight in joburg! 

Compensation wise, only my son will get a voucher or a lesser amount of cash, since we volunteered to change with him. 

I want to add that we had an absolutely fantastic KLM attendant, Katie, who tried her absolute hardest to get all of us on our initial flight. She left no stone unturned. Thank you, we really appreciated all your efforts. I'll be sending in a great review to KLM.

In my case, two trips come to mind.

One was to Morocco — I went solo, bought the ticket just two days before, and spent 10 days letting the unknown guide me.

The other was walking the Camino de Santiago with my mother. I’m a 32-year-old man, and something deep shifted along the way.

Originally, my layover in Taiwan was only 2 hours and 35 minutes, but China Airlines changed my flight schedule, and now the layover is 11 hours. I called them, and while they’re willing to reschedule me for a next-day flight with a shorter layover, I can’t delay my travel plans any further.

Since I really don’t want to sit in the terminal for 11 hours like I’m stuck in airport jail, I asked the airline if I could leave the airport to explore Taipei for a bit.

Did you pick up some Russian before heading over and was it very helpful in these countries or should I learn some basic Turkish too? Was English easily understood in most places or not really? 
I was thinking of learning basic phrases in Russian before going, things such as please, thank you, excuse me, where is the toilet, how much, etc as I heard that most will understand Russian to some degree. 

Any food recommendations and highlights that I should be aware of? We're big foodies so are game to try anythjnf and everything- in Aus, there's not much exposure to Central Asia cuisine so I have been very curious. I heard that there are some similarities with Afghanistan cuisine which I love.

travel,1jistro,South Korea in a nutshell,"As promised in the previous post, seems like you guys like it so I am gonna do another on on South Korea. For those arriving from Europe or North America, you guys will be at Terminal 1 Seoul Incheon International Airport ( unless you fly with Korean Air as they operate exclusively out of Terminal 2). Seoul has two airports: Seoul Incheon- an international hub and Seoul Gimpo ( mostly serves domestic and regional flight to China, Japan or Taiwan). I basically have only two advice: download 'Klook' and a South Korean navigation map called 'Naver Map'.

For the sake of seamless travel, you would need stable internet connection right? Who could survive these days without internet connection? Go to Klook and type in Sim/Card pick up in Incheon Airport. You then need to select the right time and terminal from which you can redeem the Sim/Card from Korea Telekom. Just go straight to their counters at the arrival area and you will see a bunch of those. When I did this trip in July 2024, I got unlimited data in 5 days for just under $25 and it was really good. Klook also offers pretty reasonably priced day trip to Nami Island which is like 1h30 away from downtown Seoul. Speaking of transportation to downtown Seoul, you can take the express train from either terminals in Seoul Incheon. Again, it is available on Klook. As of today, the Arex service is only $8 on my Klook account. Don't waste money for a taxi if you are on a tight budget since Seoul Incheon is like a 90-minute drive from downtown Seoul. 

If you want to get a genuine experience of Seoul, go to the open-air local market such as Namdaemun to try topokki or some other local delicacies. I swear there are a ton of those and they are top-notch food with very affordable prices. You could also visit the tourist areas such as Myeongdong (a street full of food carts and gift shop), Itaewon or Gyeongbokgung Palace. If you think of what to bring home as a gift, I would recommend to purchase cosmetics from Olive Young ( a cosmetic giant in South Korea) or some domestically produced red ginseng products. If you want some unique Korean food, go to the GS25 or CU convenience store. You will be amazed by how much food they have to offer. (TRY THE YONSEI CAKE AS IT IS STUFFED WITH A LOT OF CREAM INSIDE ITS SO GOODDDDDDD). Also, sign up for one of their art shows and I guarantee you will like it. 

At last, if you want to visit a theme park like Disneyland in the US, Everland is for you. I have to reiterate it but it is on Klook as well. And if you are done with Seoul, you can go the the Seoul Central Station and purchase a high-speed rail ticket to Busan. Or if you have time, you can go to Jeju island which is also equally interesting as visiting Seoul. There, you get to see the dormant volcano. Fun fact: Seoul-Jeju is the busiest domestic route in the world which I think is because of the fact that a lot of city dwellers in Seoul seek a peaceful getaway within their country to wind down AND Jeju island turns out to be the right place.

That pretty much wraps up my South Korea review guys. I hope it provides you guys with the exhaustive view of what and how to do it properly. I know I mentioned a lot of Klook but the app is that good as it has saved me a ton of money and makes me hassle-free. If I my upvotes hit 1000 I will do another blog called:' Singapore in a nutshell'. Thanks for bearing with me till this point.

travel,1jt3zhh,Scams in Europe (as a European),"Since I really appreciated all the advice and scam warnings about Egypt, I wanted to return the favor and share some common scams and tourist traps you might run into around Europe!

Flower Scams: People (sometimes even kids) will try to hand you a rose as if it’s a gift. Once you accept it, they’ll demand money and refuse to take it back. Best move: just don’t take it in the first place. If you already did, just drop it and walk away.

Bracelet Trick: Similar to the rose scam — someone might tie a bracelet on your wrist and say it’s a gift after you’ve refused, and  then of course still demand payment. Be firm and walk off if this happens.

Restaurants Sneaking in Charges: In tourist-heavy areas, some restaurants will bring out a cheese board or dips without you ordering them. It seems like a free appetizer, but you’ll see it on the bill later. Always ask if it’s complimentary before touching it.

Tourist Trap Red Flags: If there’s a host outside pushy trying to pull people in or rushing you to sit before you can even properly read the menu — probably not the best place to eat.

Transportation Tips: Public transport works really well in most European cities. If you need a ride, go with Uber or Bolt over traditional taxis, which can be overpriced or shady.

Street Performers in Costume: Those dressed up as mascots or characters may offer free photos, especially with kids — but they’ll expect payment afterward. Just say no unless you’re okay tipping them.

Fake Charity Scams (esp. in Paris): Groups (often young women) will approach you with clipboards, asking for donations to a fake charity. Politely decline and keep walking — donate to a legit organization in your own country instead.

Pickpocketing: Thankfully I haven’t been pickpocketed, even after traveling to a bunch of cities where it’s a known issue. I always carry a small crossbody bag with a zipper, worn in front. Fanny packs worn the same way seem like a solid option too.

Photo Scam: Someone may offer to take a “professional” photo of your group, only to later try and sell it to you printed on a plate or souvenir frame. Just use your own phone and pass on this one.

Hope this helps someone out there! Feel free to add your own experiences — always good to know what to look out for.

travel,1k0pu85,Pickpocketing prevention in Europe?,"Hello,

My family and I are travelling to Europe for the first time this summer (mainly Paris, London, and different parts of Italy and Spain) and we’re afraid of falling victim to pickpocketing there because we heard of how common it is. Do any locals or anybody who’s travelled there have advice to decrease the chances we get pickpocketed as foreigners? 

Edit: Thank you so much for all of the great advice! This post got much more traction than I expected it to haha. I went to Colombia last year where pickpocketing is also fairly common so I have some experience protecting myself, and I understand a lot of it just basic common sense (simply not keeping your valuables in visible pockets or in baggy clothes) but I heard that there was a chance it could be worse in Europe so I wanted to hear if there were any greater safety measures we could take. I heard they even unzip bags if you’re not keeping an eye on it. These could also just be exaggerated rumours but I always rather be safe than sorry :) 

My sister also recently fell victim to a pickpocket here at home in Toronto where we thought we were safe! (pickpocketing is rarely brought up as a concern here in comparison to other crimes) So I guess you could say we’ve learned our lesson and are trying to be much more aware now 😅

And I’d like input on my own idea: I’ve thought about attaching the wrist strap of my phone case to a carabiner attached to my pants if I do decide to leave it in my pocket at times—assuming that it’d be much harder to yank my phone out of my pocket if it’s attached to a carabiner lol",111,0.7,287,2025-04-16 17:15:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k0pu85/pickpocketing_prevention_in_europe/,pootluv

travel,1jw0ph0,I had a blast in Egypt 🇪🇬 as a female traveller,"I went to Hurghada with another female friend of mine, instead of staying at hotels or resorts we opted for an Airbnb in a higher end residential apartment complex.

We only ate at restaurants/cafes which had good reviews on Google, ordered from Talabat many times and had zero stomach issues. I avoided drinks with ice in it, and drank so much fresh juice. Ate all kinds of fruit and salads with no issues. Although later i got to know my coffee was made with tap water and i drank that two times a day 😅
I only got ripped off one time, with a vape i brought which was supposed to be 1000 puffs but finished in half a day. It might not be the sellers fault,because he opened the package in front of me. 

Before i brought anything i checked the price on Talabat (which is generally more expensive because its a delivery app) and never paid anything more than the price on the app. 
Used Uber everywhere with card payment,never took local taxis.
Instead of buying a sim card at the airport,i brought one in the city at the Orange store for the same price they listed on their website.

Got 7GB internet package with sim card for 250 egp or something. 
The hustlers didn't bother me much, they are just doing their job,why hate on them? 
Just don't engage, and keep on walking.
At Karnak Temple we got approached by a security guard offering to take our pictures which we didn't want at first but somehow he managed to take my phone and snap a few pictures, well i got a few okay-ish pictures and paid nothing to him,because thats not how it works.

Never spoken to any taxi driver,wait staff or shop keeper outside of the necessity, and definitely didn't smile or joked/laughed with any man. Kept the talking brief and maintained a stone face at all times. Never got harassed.

I just remembered something else, for money exchange i used Revolut to exchange my local currency to EGP and withdrew at an ATM once i reached there. Mostly at Bank of Egypt ATMs. But in Hurghada i could use my card almost everywhere. 

I had a really amazing vacation ❤️

travel,1jrphhc,The lows of solo travel,"I'm currently on a trip in central america and finding it depressing how hard it's been to meet people/socialize. 

I've traveled since I was about 19, now I'm 31(m) and I've never found it this difficult to integrate into a hostels social scene. I've approached people and started conversations, asked what people are up to or where they're from etc (the usual) but the conversations more often than not just go dead with little to no reciprocal effort.

The last hostel I was at I saw these guys that were on the same shuttle as me when we arrived  so I went and chatted for a bit only for them to walk off as soon as these girls showed up that they seemed to know.

I'm by myself for a couple weeks until my girlfriend arrives and it's been exhausting making these attempts and people just seeming to want to stay in their cliques. I have tried mentioning my girlfriend earlier so that guys don't see me as ""competition"" when there are girls around (kinda pathetic but a lot of guys seem to give the cold shoulder if there are girls around until I do this) and so the women don't think I'm just trying to hook up or something like that.

Maybe it's just luck of the draw, maybe it's younger generations not being as social, maybe I'm just more awkward than I used to be but I feel tired and a bit self conscious.
If I simply don't try to talk to anyone nobody has approached me so far.

We drove around the south of Spain, went to Gibraltar, and took the ferry from Tarifa to Tangier.  We spent a couple of days enjoying Morocco. When we were at passport control in the ferry terminal at Tangier Ville to go back to Tarifa, my passport, my husband’s and my son’s all were processed normally and stamped.

 When they got to my 15 year old daughter, they spent forever looking at it, looking at her, asking other officials to look at it, gesticulating in a way that suggested confusion. I don’t understand Arabic, unfortunately. After about 10 minutes, they had her stand in front of a camera for a photo, and a few minutes later smiled, said “it’s ok!”, gave a thumbs up, and waved us through.

We were all laughing after because while trying to remain calm we were all panicking internally imagining ourselves in a holding cell being interrogated.

For added context- her passport is 3 years old and her face has undergone normal pubescent changes so she looks older but not THAT different. We travel frequently and her passport had been checked entering and exiting Gibraltar and entering Morocco without so much as a second glance just within a 5 day period. When we reentered Spain an hour later there was no issue.

I love love love the archipelago surrounding the city. I had the chance to appreciate the outer islands as the cruise from Tallinn approached Stockholm city centre and passed by the archipelago. The islands were almost totally covered by snow, which looked so stunning! After a few days, I took a day trip from Gamla Stan to Vaxholm by ferry. Vaxholm is such a lovely and peaceful place which is very easy to get to. I really enjoy my time there, and would love to explore other islands such as Landsort next time.

Of course, Stockholm itself is a wonderful city with amazing museums, palaces and scenery that captured my heart. The open-air museum Skansen is very interesting, with a zoo that houses many different kinds of animals; Vasa Museum and the Royal Palace where the changing of the guard took place outside are both very impressive. I would say the food is very good too, even though it is expensive (not surprising for a Nordic country).

My experience with Mondee has been nothing short of a nightmare, resulting in a $3,500 loss with zero support or resolution after 9 months of disputes. Here's why you should think twice before using their services:

THE SITUATION:

* Booked Kapari Natural Hotel in Santorini through Mondee (June 2024)
* Arrived to find completely unacceptable conditions (July 31, 2024)
* Had to leave within 2 hours and book alternative accommodation
* Still fighting for a refund 9 months later
* Credit Card Disputes denied because Mondee transferred payment to the hotel.

MAJOR ISSUES:

1. Mondee refuses responsibility despite: • Processing my payment • Listing the property on their platform • Making false representations about the accommodation • Acting as the booking agent
2. Property Conditions (All Documented with Photos): • Extensive mold infestation • Structural damage (holes in walls) • Broken plumbing • 40 undisclosed steps to room (accessibility nightmare) • Unsanitary conditions throughout • Direct view of nudist pool area (not disclosed)
3. Customer Service Failures: • Refused to process refund • Claimed ""no responsibility"" as middle-man • Told me to ""seek refund from hotel"" (whom I never paid directly) • Ignored safety and health concerns • No resolution after multiple disputes

IMPACT:

* Paid twice for accommodation ($3,500 loss)
* Ruined start of family vacation
* Endless hours wasted on disputes
* Significant stress and inconvenience

BOTTOM LINE:  
Mondee operates on a ""not our problem"" business model. They'll take your money, but the moment something goes wrong, they abandon their customers. Their claim of being ""just a middle-man"" is convenient when problems arise, yet they're happy to act as a direct service provider when collecting payment.

WARNING TO OTHER TRAVELERS:  
If you're considering using Mondee, understand that you'll have ZERO protection if things go wrong. They will not stand behind their listings or support their customers. Your money will be at risk with no real recourse.

ADVICE:

* Book directly with hotels or use reputable travel sites with actual customer protection
* Document EVERYTHING if you do use Mondee
* Check other review sites - you'll find similar horror stories
* Save yourself the headache and avoid this company entirely

After 9 months of getting nowhere with their ""customer service,"" I'm sharing this to warn others. Don't make the same $3,500 mistake I did.

travel,1jndg7u,Does food taste different to you in other countries?,"I’ll start off by saying I probably haven’t traveled nearly as much as some of the people in this sub. 

I live in the US, have traveled to many states here, and abroad have traveled to Mexico, Honduras, US and British Virgin Islands, Italy, Norway, Uruguay, Spain, Iceland and Poland. 

One of the things that I hear a lot is how much better the food tastes in other countries, or how it tastes differently than it does in the states. I am currently in Poland, I have Polish coworkers that after moving to the US have refused to eat meat or chicken stating that it “tastes fake”. Now that I’m here in Poland and I can try their version… it tastes the same to me. Similarly with Spain, I have a friend that is Spaniard and she was so excited when I visited because she said the food was going to be amazing, that the individual ingredients taste so much better. I’ll admit, the food was fantastic, but I don’t think it was because the actual food tasted differently, I think it was just well seasoned and cooked. The individual food itself tasted the same to me. 

I also have the food palate of a child so it could just be me. Just wondering if anyone else feels the same way. ",71,0.71,179,2025-03-30 14:20:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jndg7u/does_food_taste_different_to_you_in_other/,CroissantWhisperer

travel,1js8p2i,My experience transiting through the U.S. from El Salvador as a Canadian,"So I(36F) had bought my ticket before any political shifts a few months ago. I've heard great things about El Salvador and needed to see for myself (PS — highly recommend!).

Now for passing through immigration. I was already on edge given all the recent news, but I decided to just go with it. I didn't wipe my phone or prepare myself for anything. I figured if something were to happen, I might as well see it through LOL. I flew through EWR (New Jersey). I arrived at the security guard and, without stereotyping too much, he reminded me of one of those Jersey boys that could have been on Jersey Shore. At first, he was laid back and chewing gum and asked me where I came from and where I'm going. I said I came from El Salvador and was headed home to Canada. He perked right up. El Salvador?

I then got what felt like 20 questions: Did I go alone? Did I meet anyone there? Where did I visit? Why did I visit? How long was I there? Do I travel alone often? Why do I travel? What do I do for work? And more. All while going page by page in my passport looking at all my stamps.

Now, I've passed through the US a few times—always a layover, never a visit. I know these are normal questions they can ask, but I haven't been questioned like this before.

Overall, it was a fine layover—no real headaches—but you can feel they’ve upped the security.",66,0.67,104,2025-04-05 17:28:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1js8p2i/my_experience_transiting_through_the_us_from_el/,Plantirina

travel,1k0suxi,Want to take a trip across America. Can't drive.,"I live in New York. I grew up in London and never learnt to drive, my family has never had a car - we've never needed one. I haven't really been out of the tri-state area much, and whenever I've been out of the city it's been on a train or on a car driven by someone else. Given my current circumstances, I neither have the means nor the money to learn how to drive and get a license/car for at least another few years (college student). 

However, I have a free summer and some saved-up money and I want to go travelling across the US, which is something I've never done. I have a couple of landmarks I want to see and some towns I want to visit, mostly on the West Coast, but I don't know how to do this without a car. I've looked into buses but they're slow and inconvenient - especially considering I want to visit friends who live in smaller cities in Washington, Oregon and California and there are almost no direct bus routes between them. I can only really afford one flight (probably a roundtrip to Seattle or LA) but from there I really don't know what to do. 

I've considered maybe going with friends who can drive but everyone I've asked already has summer plans and I prefer travelling alone. That said, I'm also kind of cautious of taking buses at weird hours as a solo traveller. 

Any advice? Am I screwed? Should I wait a few years until I'm in a position where I can get a license? Should I take my saved money and travel somewhere else? I've been wanting to do this kind of trip for a while for sentimental reasons and any helpful tips would be appreciated.

8. Above Monterosso at a convent looking south toward the other 4 towns. 
9. A quiet cemetery above Monterosso
10. Monterosso in the evening
11. Vernazza - Ristorante Belfotre, inside an old fort right in the water. Amazing food. Mostly outdoor seating. Excellent service. Highly recommend. 
12. Morning walk from Corniglia to Vernazza. This is just above the town and he was heading away from the main path. I assume his property. 
13. Morning view of Corniglia perched on top of the hill from the Cinque Terra path.  This is the only of the 5 towns not directly on the water. 
14. Approaching Vernazza from the south on the pathway. 
15. Quiet morning in the home between Vernazza and Monterosso. Before the crowds and the intense heat. 
16. STEEP stairs leading down to Monterosso. If you zoom in you will see. A man at the bottom coming up. (That’s also not the bottom, he already had climbed a lot of stairs before even getting to that point). 
17. The beach in Monterosso (new town side)
18. Diving off the pier for a swim at Vernazza. If I could close my eyes and magically appear anywhere in the world, it would be there on that day. Hot as hell, decided to cut sightseeing short and swim with my family for a while. The water was perfect, and somewhat salty so it made you very buoyant and easy to float around.   One of the best days I can remember. Just above this is the old fort and Ristorante Belforte where we water after this and which I pictured above.

travel,1juyt6v,"Need help: Unintentionally overstayed in Vietnam and now being told extension is the only option, which could take weeks to process.","I overstayed my Vietnam e-visa by 22 days due to an honest mistake. I applied for a 90-day visa and stupidly assumed the visa matched the application, but somehow it was only granted for 63 days. I didn’t realise the actual expiry date and accidentally overstayed.

I tried to leave the country, but immigration at the airport denied me boarding and said I had to go to the immigration office. I wasn’t allowed to pay the fine at the airport.

At the HCMC immigration office, they’ve told me I *must* apply for a visa extension, which could take 2 weeks or even longer. (one officer quoted up to two months!) After this happened, I went back with a Vietnamese friend who clearly asked whether I could apply for an *exit visa*, but the officer said this doesn’t exist and that an extension is the only way forward.

From everything I’ve read online, applying for an exit visa (or exit permit) seems like the standard route for overstays under 30 days. I don’t want to stay in Vietnam longer, I just want to leave as soon as possible and pay the fine.

I’ve already filled out the NA5 and supporting documents, but haven’t submitted them yet.

Has anyone been through this recently and can confirm:

* Does the exit visa actually exist and apply in this situation?
* Can I still request it even if the officer says no?
* Is this just a bureaucratic block or is extension genuinely the only way?

travel,1jue6j8,Thoughts on visiting the same country twice in a row?,"I’ve had this discussion a few times with a friend and we have fundamentally different travel philosophy. He believes in never visiting the same country twice until he’s been to them all, he’s been to over 20 countries and says there’s only one he would revisit at this point. 

We went on my first big international trip last year and I mentioned wanting to go back to do all the things we missed plus some of the solo stuff I couldn’t do with him. 

He told me that would be a mistake and if I’m going to travel I should try going somewhere else before repeating the same country. Even if I want to visit again, at least don’t go back to back.

I’d like to open a discussion on this topic and hear all sides. I personally don’t see what’s wrong with what im doing. This would be my first big solo trip, so I figured going to the same country gives me some familiarity while I get used to traveling alone. And it would be a completely different region in that country anyway, with a different language, so it’s not like I’m going back to the same exact place.

Will I regret it? I can only do 1-2 trips like this a year and im getting older so in a way im missing out on some other destination to do this twice.

travel,1k29tfc,Would you learn a foreign language for the sake of traveling?,"Essentially what the headline says. I'm interested in any thoughts you would like to share on the topic. 

Optionally, I'll give a bit of context for my personal situation. Feel free to skip this. I might not be an interesting read;

Ever since I reached adulthood I have prioritized traveling in my life. Fortunately, I have a husband that shares my passion and even if our traveling styles are somewhat different, we have always been able to make compromises and plan trips that are satisfying for both of us.

My husband would be perfectly content, flying to the US for every vacation, whereas I always want to see something new and visit places and countries that I haven't been to yet.

This means that for the last 10+ years, we have always spent 2 weeks in the US and 2 weeks someplace else. Therefore, I never really saw the point in learning a new language just for traveling, because even if the language would come in handy for one trip, I would probably never need it again.

However, last year I felt inspired to sit down and think about which countries I feel like I absolutely need to have seen in my life and to my surprise there aren't actually that many left. Meaning that in a couple of years I could essentially visit all the remaining countries.

And of course that brought me to the question: Where will we travel to, once we've already seen all that we've wanted to see? – The answer I have arrived at is that we would revisit those places that we enjoyed most the first time around.

With the prospect of possibly revisiting some of these countries again and again over the coming years, I think it might be worth it to learn some of these languages up to at least a low intermediate level.

While it would obviously be a big plus on the one hand to speak some Japanese for example, when we explore some of the less touristy corners of the country, it would also be a big commitment on the other hand, even if I only dedicate a limited amount of time to it.

I'm also a bit ""worried"" that by learning a certain language, I would be more inclined to choose destinations where I can speak that language. That  might feel like I'm limiting myself, I don't know.",56,0.79,117,2025-04-18 16:58:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k29tfc/would_you_learn_a_foreign_language_for_the_sake/,salian93

travel,1jrxx7h,"Bus Service from Tissamaharama (Thissa) to Ella, Sri Lanka","I had a difficult time finding accurate and complete information for the bus route from Tissamaharama (Thissa) to Ella in Sri Lanka (bus route 10) online, so I wanted to provide this for future Sri Lanka bus travel planners.

**General Overview**
According the bus station attendant in Thissa, route 10 buses leave at 7am and 8:10am from Thissa to Ella. The full bus route is from Katharagama to Kandy, which is shown on the bus signage along with its route number.

I got on the “7am” bus in Thissa at 7:09am and I got to Ella at 9:58am. This was a 2 hour and 49 minute bus ride.

The bus from Thissa to Ella costs 467 Sri Lankan rupees (about usd$1.58 at the time of this post)

Primary bus stops on Route 10 are: Katharagama, Tissamaharama (Thissa), Thanamalwila, Wellawaya, Bandarawela, Welimada, Nuwaraeliya, Pussellawa, Gampola, Peradeniya, Kandy

A map and downloadable GPS file I collected of the route can be found [here](https://maphub.net/a_common_porpoise/bus-route-10-from-thissa-to-ella)

**Ride Details and How to**
Get onto the bus either from the front door or back, it doesn’t seem to matter. If you are not at a bus station, and only a roadside bus stop and flagging the bus down, be ready for the bus to only slow down and not actually stop, you have to literally jump into the bus before it speeds back up. The buses typically have route numbers (Route 10 in this case) as well as origin and destination names displayed on the front and back of the top of the bus in English. When you get on the bus, *the conductor will come to you*, tell them your destination. You pay in cash, they can typically  provide change. You will receive a paper ticket or receipt for your journey. Reservations are not possible that I know of, just show up and get on. I did not have a problem finding a seat on my buses in Sri Lanka, I never had to stand, however the buses do fill up periodically through the journey so be prepared to be crammed in if necessary.

There is some space for bags/luggage above the seats (overhead), the opening width is approximately 12 to 15 inches (30 to 38cm). On my several bus rides through Sri Lanka there was always space in these overhead spaces, but a large piece of hard-cased luggage could be difficult to find space for.  I believe there is extra storage on the back of the bus for large items, accessed from the outside of the bus, but I never had to utilize this space, so am uncertain how it works. You can also place bags at your feet or under the seat in front of you, and if there is available space, directly on the seat next to you. As a heads up, if there is no seating left on the bus, and you have a bag in the seat next to you, you may be asked to move the bag elsewhere. 

There are no restrooms on the bus, but most bus stations (not bus stops) do have basic restroom facilities, some for a small fee (~20rs) and some free. The buses do stop at some stations for 5 or more minutes, but I am uncertain how to know which ones these are beforehand if you wanted to get out, talking to the conductor would probably provide this information if you needed it. Ideally you don’t have to do this and just stay on the bus to keep your seat and not be left behind.

The buses stop when people wave them down on the side of the road. This means the buses stop and accelerate frequently depending on the route, day, and time of day. Buses can fill up and empty many times on a multi-hour trip.

Seats are in a 2 and 3 person quasi-bench configuration. On the left side of the bus, each bench can hold 2 people. On the right side of the bus, each bench can hold 3 people.

There is no AC on the buses, but windows do open. The windows are glass as well, so when it is raining you still have a view. Some buses elsewhere, like in parts of India, do not have glass windows but only opaque accordion-like blinds, so this is a nice feature in Sri Lanka.

Seats are covered with a vinyl type material and are cushioned. There are armrests on the aisle seat but not between individual seats. Legroom seems to vary between buses, some it is quite tight and others it is sufficient to generous.

Music is typically played at a medium-loud volume during the whole bus ride. Typically fast tempo local music. Personally, I found the music annoying for so many hours given its loud volume, but it is certainly part of the experience.

At larger bus stations vendors come onto the bus to sell edible items. Typically fruits, corn, nuts, and baked goods. There are also sometimes people selling (or requesting donations for) non-tangible items with pamphlets, possibly religious.

Buses do not have internal signage for stops like in the US, Europe, Japan, etc. You will need to keep the GPS on your phone up and running to know when you need to get off. When it’s your time, be ready to jump fast, as they often only slow down for you.

Bus drivers do not appear to care about road rules or safety. They drive incredibly fast, it feels extremely sketchy.

**Getting to Thissa**

The train does not go all the way to Thissa, so you will likely need to take a taxi or bus to get there. If you are somewhere west of Thissa, like Dikwella / Hiriketiya Beach, then taking the 334-1 bus is extremely easy. It comes about every 20 minutes and is in Google Maps. Most of the information above can be applied to that route as well.",43,0.88,11,2025-04-05 07:19:13,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jrxx7h,soil_nerd

travel,1jvdkkn,Where to go to do some soul searching - solo trip?,"I've traveled a lot and have a list of places I want to see, but for some reason I'm very indecisive right now. I would love to see your suggestions and hear from your experiences -  particularly places that did your soul/spirit some good.

I'm in a period of severe stress and anxiety due to work/relationship, so I've decided to take an impromptu 2 or 3 week trip to take a break from my life and figure shit out. Will be leaving next weekend, flying from Toronto (I'm a 39F of it helps, and I've done solo trips before). I'm not spiritual, so I don't mean a yoga retreat or spa, more so a chill environment with good vibes that I can lose myself in.

I'm a writer, so I would love time to focus on some personal work; an environment conducive to sitting in cafes for hours with my laptop. 

Not too quiet, as I prefer a place with some energy and vibrancy and to see people out and about.

 I love train rides, art/history, and nature. 

Don't care much for partying, shopping, or strenuous physical activities.


I typically hop from one city/town to the next, but if I really like a place then I'll stay longer - I don't book hotels/travel in advance so that I can have flexibility to be spontaneous. 

Favorite countries include Ecuador, Switzerland, Laos, France, and Thailand, and I equally enjoy big cities and small towns, and developed/less developed places. On my bucket list are Sri Lanka, Zanzibar, Mongolia, Norway, Guatemala, and further exploration of small towns across France/Italy. But I'm very open and I don't have to pick one of these locations for this trip.

Would really appreciate your advice!

Hello!

Did anyone ever experience having stuff removed/missing from their checked-in bags? Me and my bf just flew in from Beijing via Bruxelles, to Budapest, and we opened our checked in bags now. I am missing a bottle of Soju, and he is missing a can of beer. It’s not much, I know, but we double and triple checked the limits of how much alcohol we can bring and we were both well under. 

Moreover, my bag had also some snacks that were tempered with, as I found a tape with “B33” over it. 

Is there anything we can do about it? Would we be able to get any compensation? I don’t mind being checked, but since we were under the legal quantities, I don’t think it was the case for this.

I booked a ticket to charlotte from durham and bought 2 tickets for 51$ in total. the plan was the get there at 9:15 and get on the bus at 9:35, okay, cool.

I get there early, around 9:05am and wait. around 9:20am, a bus with a completely different bus number and was called “new york - atlanta” pulled up and I was confused if it was mine or not, so I asked two employees and both told me to go ask the driver, I went up to the driver who was offloading luggage’s and he told me no then proceeds to quick turn his back from me and keep offloading?? so Cool i go back inside feeling like a dum*ss and i wait. the bus leaves at 9:37 and a lady comes up to me and says “baby what time is your bus” and i told her 9:35 and she said “that was your bus why didn’t you get on” then flung her hands in the air and walked away while muttering something? i’m unsure why everyone is a f/ing a/hole in this place I was anxious and this is my first time solo traveling so I’m so confused why 1. He lied to me and told me it’s not my bus (and please guys believe me i SHOWED him my ticket and CLEALY said charlotte) and 2. why was the lady being so rude just cus i missed MY bus? 

I contacted greyhound support, they ignored me. Just contacted them via their website, absolute useless. I called them and was slapped in the face with “yeah that’s not our fault but i can give you a $13 voucher but charge you a $35.99 cancelling fee” ??? what the HELL is this bus station? Please, I seriously need advice how to get all my money back because i will NEVER ever use this bus again.

travel,1k3qkuz,"Trip 2026 – torn between Taiwan, Thailand, South Korea, Malaysia or Nepal – which one would you recommend?","I am based in Europe and I love traveling  – especially when it’s meaningful and a bit off the beaten path.

So far, I’ve been to:  
Portugal,  Italy, Netherlands, Switzerland, France, UK, Luxembourg,China, Japan, Singapore, Sri Lanka  
Dubai

For my **next trip in March/April 2026**, I’ll have about **2–3 weeks**, and I’m currently torn between:

* **Taiwan** – love the idea of nature, food and underrated destinations
* **Thailand** – a classic, but still new for me: street food, culture, islands, temples
* **South Korea** – big on café culture, design, and hiking. Never been!
* **Malaysia** – super diverse and interesting, **but I might want to save it** for a future trip with my mom (maybe combined with Sri Lanka)
* **Nepal** – fascinated by the landscapes and spirituality; curious about beginner-friendly treks and Kathmandu valley

Since I live in Europe, I like to **combine two countries** when flying to Asia – to make the long trip really worth it. I’m not sure when I’ll be ""in the area"" again, so I try to see a bit more when I go.

**My questions:**  
➡️ Which of these countries would feel **most different** from the places I’ve been to so far?

➡️ Any two-country combinations you’d recommend for a 2–3 week itinerary?

*Is there a destination I haven’t considered that might be just as cool for someone like me?* I'd love suggestions I might be overlooking!

Also curious:  
Are there any trips you think are **especially great in your early 30s** – before life changes (family, limited vacation time, rising costs) make them harder to do later?

Just to add some context: I’m more of a quiet and introverted person – I don’t make connections super easily when traveling, and honestly, I’m okay with that. I enjoy moving around, walking, exploring cultural sites, trying new food, or just relaxing with a book in a cozy café. I’m **not much of a beach bum** or **party type**, so I’m usually not looking for nightlife-heavy destinations.

travel,1juxng3,Bali- South Coast Beaches 🤮,"(a little rant)

Been travelling the past 14 months (huge island person) and have a home base in Bangkok.

I've avoided Bali for a lot of reasons (over hyped , over tourism, reports of pollution and influencer heaven).

A friend wanted to go to Komodo for a few nights, so we decided to stay in Bali a few nights before catching a quick 1 hour flight to lebuan Bajo.  

My expectations were already really low,  but I thought let's make the best of it, catch the epic sunsets, have a few bintangs and try to catch a few waves on the boards.

Bali Southern beaches were disgusting-  canguu to kuta-  the amount of garbage on the beaches and in the water is stomach turning.

In Thailand, beach bar owners would wake up early every morning and rake any plastic/rubbish that hit the shores..  not here in bali-  they don't give a crap at all.   You would think they would take some pride on their beach to ensure they clear out rubbish-   something that small would make a difference.

I just don't get it.   Trying to enjoy a beer at the beach but you are literally surrounded by trash -  how anyone can relax next to a landfill is crazy.      Not sure how anyone can continue to come here or anyone can actually promote it.

Again- I'm talking about the state of the beaches and water ( not the people or culture).

I've always taken reports of Bali with some grain of salt-   but it was worse than I imagined.      Definitely will never come back.   So many  islands here in Indo that deserve $$ and are actually beautiful      ",37,0.79,17,2025-04-09 04:42:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1juxng3/bali_south_coast_beaches/,OneLife-No-Do-Overs

For example, my mom goes for 30 minute daily walks and goes to an exercise class about twice a week, but unfortunately she is a somewhat slower than average walker. Do you think this would be a problem, or would she fall within the range of ""moderate""?

ITINERARY (ish) : 
we started in Tacoma, WA, but we only stayed for the night after our flight and didnt stay for anything but Mt. Rainier and Mt. Saint Helens sadly (both so pretty, but i didnt take many pictures), (i wanted to go to the beaches)
then drove down Highway 1, stopping at a bunch of tourist-y locations along the way, stayed the night in Lincoln, Oregon
kept going along Highway 1 (stopping at tourist locations) until we got to Mill Valley, CA, where we stayed until we left for home.

IMAGES : 

first : Agate Beach, OR
SO windy. the wind on the beaches here are insane. it was super pretty, and the beach itself is massive. there were huge dunes that were insanely hard to walk past 😭. we stayed in the hotel right next to it, gorgeous view! very nice hotel too

second : top of Devil’s Punchbowl, OR
soooo huge ! make sure you go when the tide is low so you dont get swamped.

third : in the Devil’s Punchbowl, OR
tons of wildlife to look at, so beautiful, there was a lot of disrespectful people sadly though-definitely a tourist spot. (i also was a tourist so i cant talk lol

fourth : Natural Bridges, OR
the view is nice but theres not much to do related to it, nothing but pictures lol. cant walk up or anything as far as i could tell (though someone was sitting on that arch at one point?? so unsafe looking i dunno how they got there)

fifth : Ape Cave
cold, but not as cold as youd think (but maybe i just got used to it quick cause we were in there for so long). theres two different trails you can do once you go in, an easy and an intermediate, we thought ‘lets not be scaredy cats’ and did the intermediate, be prepared to sweat and CLIMB. there were HUGE rocks, boulders, that you had to hoist yourself ontop of, most are somewhat wet, and there was one point with about a 7’ cliff (up) that had a small rope to use to pull yourself up with. honestly it was really fun though!! first ever cave i had been to and it was actually such a good workout. warning: very dark! you NEED to have a professional(?) grade flashlight (it was required), we got handheld ones but its cause the forehead ones were sold out. definitely wear some thick pants, my dad wore shorts (for some reason??) and it was reaaall uncomfortable

sixth : Tour Thru Tree, CA
thats the specific location but it was near/in the redwood national forest and the trees are soooo beautiful, super tall and even though theyre not the widest, still probably way bigger than what you’d see anywhere else! 

- orgeon is SO gorgeous
- dont take highway 1. i dont know if its worth the views, the roads are windy and really close to a very high cliff, there were a supprising amount of semis and BIG trucks speeding, i dont get car sick and even i felt nauseous driving on it
- stay outside of san francisco, close by the bridge so if you wanna explore the city you can do it without a far drive-IF youre okay with toll prices. we stayed in Mill Valley and it was a cute little town, very walkable
- as a teenage girl, i loved the Asian Mall in SF, so many cute stores, cafes, etc. definitely worth a visit if youre nearby.
- if you travel through SF definitely consider driving or using an uber 😭. through the different ‘towns’ (japantown, german town, etc) it may say its a few miles, but thats gonna be uphill (from most locations you start from) and its really hard to find bathrooms or places to sit. we ubered back to the car.

Budapest is of great appeal to me because it seems to have all of what I just mentioned above. Prague similarly, but I'm more interested in Budapest.

Istanbul seems awesome in the same way, tons of historical stuff, but the most appealing part is the culture difference. It'd be the most culturally different place I've ever been to, as I hail from the US. I've always found great interest in the middle east (if you want to consider Turkey as part of it, I see it as a transition zone - and thus a good gateway into it). I've learned the Arabic alphabet and can write it confidently (don't speak much of the language though), and although Turkey primarily uses latin alphabet nowadays, I know it's still present on some signs and stuff and I think it'd be real cool to see it around as well.

Any help deciding which one to go to? Thanks!

Edit: I'm aware of the civil unrest in Istanbul, but was mainly under the consideration / asking if it may be better in around two months when I would consider going.",34,0.7,137,2025-03-31 03:49:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jnuih5/cant_decide_where_to_go_budapestprague_or_istanbul/,bruhHandSanitizer
travel,1jkg1uc,New Orleans 2025: City and Mardi Gras,"This year, I fulfilled my dream of going to New Orleans to see the city and spend Mardi Gras there. It was awesome! I stayed for 10 nights, and spent half of my days primarily for Mardi Gras, the other half for visiting.

Some of my highlights:

* **Swamp tour in the honey island bayou**: absolutely stunning nature, and the closeness to the animals (primarily raccoons due to the season) was amazing. Probably my favourite part of the trip. 
* **Whitney plantation tour**: very interesting to learn more about the life of slaves on a sugar plantation and the history of the region. It added a much needed real and serious touch after the parades.
* **Cooking class at the New Orleans School of Cooking**: we made seafood gumbo, crawfish pie, and banana foster and I will definitely try to implement some of the things I learned at home. It was very fun and tasty. 
* **St. Louis Cemetery No. 1 tour**: very interesting, even if I would have liked to spend time on my own there
* **Parades**: The whole experience of the floats, the marching bands, the throws - it was wild! From a European point of view, the amount of trash was shocking, and the fact that throwing coconuts etc. is permitted baffled me completely. My favourite parade by far was the *Bacchus* parade. All parades were very impressive (we don't have anything near as big where I live), but this one blew me away even more than the others, with the lights and the moving decorations. 
* **Favourite food**: the praline beignets at *Loretta's* (French market) are to die for and I visited the restaurant *Cochon Butcher* three times while there.
* Favourite places in the city: **St. Patrick's church** was more to my liking than St. Louis Cathedral; **Royal street** (French Quarter) for all the little shops and art galleries; **Audubon Aquarium** was a nice alternative for bad weather or as a change to all the sightseeing, as was the **World War II museum** (it's huge, I could have spent two days only here); the **riverwalk** is very nice to just lounge and relax (it was very crowded on Lundi Gras for Zulu's festival though but the fireworks were worth it).",35,0.97,1,2025-03-26 16:33:58,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jkg1uc,PositiveBeginning231

travel,1jlwppp,Hotel took my money?,"Can I get my money back? ~~

Reserved a hotel on Priceline for my birthday. Decided to pay on the website instead of at the counter (to save a measley $8). The main thing is that it didn't even ask me my name at all, just my billing info, which was a card number (and by default included the billing name on my Cashapp card, Joey Evans).

I show up with an ID that says Joseph Evans and the guy very sarcastically and rudely says he can't help me. Says I have to take it up with whatever 3rd party I booked the room with. He says he can't book me, but says to change the name on the reservation. I look at Priceline that says you can't change a name. But it DID say you could add a name, however saying that you must talk to the hotel in order to add a name.

So I ask him and he says he can't add a name. I suspect he was lying about something as he said I would have to do it on the website (and his demeanor).

So I end up booking a brand new room (again, with my ID). But what's strange is we were able to use my wife's debit card (with her name) no problem.

Anyway, was wondering who I should talk to in order to get my money back. The next morning a separate concierge said the room last night had in fact been 'cancelled' whatever that means.

Who do you think has my money? And is it worth it write an email to them (depending on if it's Priceline or the hotel). Priceline does say no refunds but this is crazy.

Was a cheap room, only $100.",29,0.63,72,2025-03-28 14:44:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jlwppp/hotel_took_my_money/,masterjoebear

At the moment, Ryanair seems to be the best option, having the best flying hours, and prices.
However, I can see that most people complain about them, having bad experiences while using their services.

My questions are these:

-As long as we respect Ryanair’s luggage policy, is there anything else to worry about?
-When purchasing their tickets, I can see an Insurance plus, available, covering medical, and some cancellation fees.
Is this Insurance plus worth paying for it, adding up to only 40€ in total, for the entire 12 days trip?
-Should we switch to Wizz air, although the arrival is later in the afternoon, and the departure earlier during the day, shortening the trip by a few hours?

travel,1jivnkd,Bringing Cheese into the US from the UK: How does customs declarations work?,"I'm about to head from the US to the UK, and I'm considering picking up some fancy cheeses while there, such as cheddar from Cheddar. The friend I'm travelling with is concerned that, upon my return, I would have to declare that cheese and wait in a potentially long line through customs once I land back in the US.

  
I've looked up guidance on bringing cheese in from other countries, and the USDA website states that solid cheeses (like cheddar or gouda, with a hard rind) may enter from essentially any country. \[[Link Here](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/know-before-you-go/prohibited-and-restricted-items)\]. I also know that the US is very particular about cheese being made from unpasteurized milk, and such cheeses aren't allowed in the US.

It's been a long time since I've last flown internationally, and the question is: If I'm confident my items do not violate any customs or border protection policies, do I still need to declare them? 

Is it the case where if I don't declare, they search my bags, find the cheese, 1 of 2 things will happen: 

A) I'm mistaken about policy or the cheese I brought, my cheese is confiscated and I'm slapped with a fine

B) The cheese is determined to be within policy, and nothing further happens

  
Or is there a 3rd option I might face, such as an annoyed CBP agent wanting to do further examination & questioning because I had an undeclared item (regardless of if it met policy or not).

  
Finally, does it make a difference when going through customs if the cheese I'm bringing back is in my carryon or checked bag?


EDIT: So I learned the main reason for my friend's concern about customs and declarations is one occasion where they declared something, they spent 1.5 hours with a CBP agent going through their stuff and asking questions (I believe they were traveling from Slovenia, and I don't think any of what they declared fell into restricted categories).

I just came through the other night with my English cheese. Simply told the CBP agent I had cheese, and he waved me on through, not further questions.

travel,1jmth0g,My assorted tips after a (mostly) self-guided trip to Egypt,"Hello.

I had a trip to Egypt over Christmas/New Years that I mostly did self-guided. Although Egypt is a very popular tourist destination, many people just organise a guided or all inclusive tour. I self-arranged my trip and so thought I would share some general tips for those who are thinking to do the same. 

I’m by no means an expert on Egypt, but hopefully sharing my experience can help others. 

For context, I visited Cairo, Aswan and Luxor over about 12 days. I am a (non-Egyptian) Arabic speaker and visited with my non-Arabic speaking wife, but I don’t believe speaking Arabic is necessary for self-serving Egypt. Our preferred travel standard for an average trip is one step “above” backpacking, with private rooms in basic hotels, public transport and basic/local restaurants.

Where I refer to prices here, assume I paid EGP (Egyptian Pounds) unless I mention otherwise, although I'll mostly quote prices here in USD. Egypt has had bad inflation and currency devaluation, so online prices in EGP go out of date very quickly, whereas their foreign currency equivalent is more stable. 

And apologies in advance, this post turned out way longer than I expected...

# Airport and Visa on Arrival

If you’re eligible for a Visa on Arrival, getting one is painless and generally the recommended way compared to getting an evisa online - many people report the Egyptian evisa website to be very janky.

It costs 25 USD and I paid in USD cash at Cairo International Airport. I paid with a 100 USD note for 2 visas and got 50 a USD note back (I read online that you get your change back in EGP but that wasn’t my experience). Although I have not tried it, I have read you can also pay in EUR and GBP, and that some of the desks accept credit cards. The VOA is a bit funny in that you buy a physical visa slip from one of a few bank desks at the airport and then take the slip and your passport to the immigration desk. You can find more detailed guides online about this if you’re worried, but it’s not hard when you’re there. 

Incidentally, Cairo airport was totally fine on both the way in and out, I think it’s been cleaned up a bit compared to reports I’ve read online. 

To get from the hotel We arranged a driver from our hotel for $20 which is significantly more expensive than taking an uber, but our flight arrived at night (like 11PM) and so we wanted to be secure. For reference, an uber back from downtown cost around $4.

We picked up a Vodafone sim card at arrivals because we read online that they had good coverage all over the country, there are also Orange and Etisalat booths next to it which probably are fine also. 

# Cash

Cards can be used surprisingly widely in Egypt, but you will definitely need cash as well throughout your trip.

ATMs are literally everywhere - it’s the most ATMed country I’ve ever been to - which is handy as their highest note is only 200 EGP (worth around 4USD at time of writing). Every bank ATM I used was totally free, including for foreign cards. This next advice is not specific to Egypt, but make sure you bring a card that won’t charge you foreign exchange fees for use overseas, and decline any Dynamic Currency Conversion offered by any card terminals or ATMs (Google it if you don’t know what DCC is). I did encounter a higher than average number of out of order ATMs but due to how many ATMs there are everywhere this wasn’t a huge deal. 

Touristy places and larger purchases will probably accept foreign currency too, for instance I was short in EGP for paying for breakfast at a guesthouse, but they were happy to accept GBP for it. Apparently hotels in Egypt are required to charge you in foreign currency for your stay, but I don’t think this is universally followed. I prepaid most of my hotels online, although there was one where I paid cash on arrival. I paid that hotel in USD but they were happy to accept basically anything, including EGP. 

Basically all tourist attractions (temples, museums etc) accept card only. Prices can be found on the Egypt Monuments website https://egymonuments.com/. You can technically buy tickets online to most attractions but ticket lines were never really an issue so we never bothered. 

Getting smaller notes can be a hassle sometimes, e.g. a shop might not have enough change for a bottle of water, so break larger notes where you can.

# Transport in town

**Cairo**

In Cairo, you can use Uber to get around easily and without hassle. You can pay by cash or card but I always used the “pay with cash” option because I read stories online of drivers accepting card trips and then demanding cash anyway, but I had zero troubles with any Uber drivers. All took me where I wanted to go and all charged the amount in the app. Uber is ridiculously cheap and I always gave a cash tip on top as well, although I don’t believe this is expected based on some of the (very positive) responses drivers gave when I would tip them (And I’m talking things like rounding a $1.60 trip up to $2). I also read online people recommending Uber Comfort compared to Uber X to avoid bad drivers but honestly I didn’t notice any difference in service and had no troubles - I used both. With Uber X you might get a dirtier car or a car without seatbelts but all drivers I used were honest with me. 

Cairo also has a metro which is actually quite good, but does not go many places tourists would want to go. You can take it if you visit Coptic Cairo though, which we did. There are plans to expand the network deeper into Giza and towards the airport so maybe in the future tourists will use it more. 

I never hailed a taxi in the traditional way, but outside of tourist attractions you can always find taxis quoting overinflated prices like anywhere in the world. That being said, if you don’t feel like waiting for an Uber after leaving a museum etc, you can use the price of an Uber to negotiate a taxi down to something reasonable. E.g. leaving the Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza I was looking to get back to downtown Cairo. Uber quoted around $3-4. The taxis outside originally asked for $15. Walking away, I told them simply that I was intending to call an Uber and how much Uber was charging, and that they could have my business and save me waiting if they wanted to charge me the same as Uber. I ended up taking a taxi for $4.

**Aswan & Luxor**

In Aswan and Luxor, there is no Uber but I used an app called In Drive which works similar, except that you put your trip in and a bunch of drivers will “bid” for your trip. You can then choose which offer to take based on the price, the driver’s star rating and how far away the driver is. Similar to Uber, I had no trouble with any drivers in In Drive. This app is cash only. 

# Transport outside of town

**Drivers**

I arranged two private drivers for trips that weren’t feasible for us to do alone:

* Driver 1: Day tour from Cairo to Saqqarah, Dahshur and Memphis (quoted $50 but I paid in EGP)
* Driver 2: 4 days of drives around Luxor and Aswan (total $300 - paid in USD per the driver’s request). This was:
   * A day tour from Aswan to Abu Simbel, return
   * Transport between Aswan and Luxor one way, stopping at 3 temples on the way (Kom Ombo, Edfu, Esna)
   * A tour around Luxor’s West Bank, including a guide
   * A day tour from Luxor to Dendara and Abydos with a guide

This is where you can save a lot of money compared to what you can get online through your hotel. On the Egypt Tripadvisor Forums, there is a huge thread where people share the details of drivers and their experiences with them. People share what itineraries they did, how much they paid and the driver’s Whatsapp numbers. You can reach out to the drivers directly over Whatsapp to get some quotes. The thread is here: [https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g294200-i9124-k13746126-Drivers\_Guides\_Agency\_Recommendations\_Here-Egypt.html](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g294200-i9124-k13746126-Drivers_Guides_Agency_Recommendations_Here-Egypt.html) I recommend sorting the posts by newest and ignore posts from people with 1 comment giving glowing reviews on a driver, as those are probably fake reviews. It’s a bit more leg work compared to just booking something online or through your hotel but you will save hundreds doing this rather than booking online or through your hotel. The driver can also arrange guides for you. You do need to be clear however about what you want to visit to make sure that both you and the driver have the same expectations, so it's not necessarily as straightforward as booking a tour. 

Our Cairo to Saqqarah driver was incredible, and treated us very well, he even brought us biscuits, mandarins and tea and coffee in the car. We decided to skip Memphis because my wife was feeling a bit unwell (just fatigue) which meant we ended up coming back maybe 2 hours earlier than expected, and he wanted to charge us less than originally agreed, but I still paid him the full amount.

Luxor/Aswan was a combination of our driver who we arranged with and some contacts/colleagues of his for Abu Simbel and for the Luxor Day Trip. While he was a lovely guy, he was a bit disorganised and the Tripadvisor fame is clearly giving him more work than he was able to handle.

**Bus and Train**

I also booked 1 overnight train and 1 overnight bus. 

From Cairo to Aswan, we took the sleeper train (https://abelatrains.com/). Frankly, this is a rip off. We paid $115 each for two people in a private sleeper car. You pay Swiss prices but get Egyptian standards. That being said, flying is a hassle and we did get a decent night sleep compared the bus we'd later take, so I would *sort of* recommend it if you are aware that the train is old and rickety and the food isn’t very good (but just have dinner first before you go, it’s not like food is expensive in Cairo). The staff were nice though. Note that the train now leaves from Bashtil station - a brand new and extremely posh-looking train station rather than the old Ramses station you might still find mentioned online. Inside was quite disorganised without good signage. Multiple people gave us wrong information unsolicited (including a police officer) until we finally asked the ticket office, so I strongly recommend thanking but ignoring police officers and “helpful” locals telling you where your train is, and just ask the ticket office. Nobody was asking for tips either, they were just being helpfully unhelpful? 

From Luxor back to Cairo, we took an overnight Go-Bus https://go-bus.com. The cost here was far more reasonable (something like $20 for a 12 or so hour bus) and the standard is comparable to a coach service you might ride anywhere in the world (Flixbus etc). We booked a “business class” bus - which basically gives you a bigger seat with good recline compared to economy and is still reasonably priced. The trip would have been more comfortable but we were seated in the front and top row of a double decker bus, which meant our leg room was significantly reduced, and the front window was right in front of us so there was lots of bright light coming in from outside. The bus would have been far more comfortable in any other row but that was just our luck. Again, I would sort of recommend it, but have the right expectations. If you have the time, doing it by day could be interesting.

# Attractions, Temples etc

So the temples and monuments are main the reason we all go to Egypt, and honestly they are bloody incredible. Only in Luxor did I find the crowds too much, elsewhere it was totally fine. I won’t list everything we did as there are plenty of guides to these online, but here are a few comments especially about logistics:

**Attractions from Cairo**

**Pyramids**: We just went there by Uber and got around the complex on foot where you can basically go wherever you want. Read up on what to look out for before you go (just google for scams etc.) and you’ll be fine. Inside without a vehicle is a fair bit of walking but you can quite easily get to the panoramic points on foot, there’s a road with a footpath running through the entire site. We went in winter so the walking was fine, but in summer I’d probably want a driver in there with me too as you are just wandering through the desert. We went quite early (I think we got there at 8AM and left maybe 11ish) and it was much busier when we were leaving than when we entered. We chose not to buy the supplementary admission tickets to go inside the pyramids as we saw online that it’s very claustrophobic and without anything to see inside, particularly with other tourists there. If you don’t feel like wandering on foot, you can arrange a tripadvisor driver to come in with you, or I’m sure any Uber would be happy to do it for the right price.

**Saqqarah and Dahshur:** Saqqarah is an awesome site and is worth the visit, an easy day trip from Cairo. Some people combine it with the Pyramids of Giza in one day, which would be achievable with a driver or on a tour. We combined it with Dahshur which are more pyramids further away, and are very quiet. Both of these sites have pyramids you can go inside without the cram and crowds of the Giza pyramids. 

**Islamic Cairo** is easy to get to by Uber and a nice place to walk around, especially by evening where it gets lively.

**Coptic Cairo** is also worth going to if you have the time and you can get to by metro. There are some churches there that claim to have bits of floor where the holy family walked, stayed, drank etc (i.e. Jesus and his folks) so if you are religious (or even not) it is interesting experience.

**Cairo Museums**

Cairo has a bunch of archaeology museums these days which makes it a bit hard to decide which to go to. We went to multiple because my wife is big on archaeology, but for normies you don’t need to do that. 

The **Egyptian Museum** is the old one in Downtown Cairo. It’s full of things to see in a British-era heritage building. As a museum, it does have some big ticket items (King Tut’s mask etc) but is less organised, hotter etc. 

The **Grand Egyptian Museum** is the new one out in Giza. As a museum, it’s much more modern and does have plenty to see but it is more expensive, further away, and doesn’t have the most famous items (yet, I think the idea is to move them there eventually). 

Finally there is the **Museum of Egyptian Civilisation**, this is entirely skippable BUT it does have the mummies of the pharaohs, so if you really need to see the corpses of the various Ramses…es you can go here but otherwise I wouldn’t bother. 

Overall, I’d probably lean towards recommending the new GEM if you were going to pick one, unless you are really interested in any particular pieces, but either the GEM or EM would be ok to visit. As an aside, we walked to the EM from our downtown hotel, whereas we combined the GEM with our trip to the pyramids since both are in Giza (but this turned out to be a huge, tiring day, so I don’t know if it was the right approach). The GEM does have a good non tourist trap food court though, so it made for a great lunch stop after the pyramids too. 

**Attractions from Aswan & Luxor:**

**Abu Simbel**: a day trip from Aswan, this site is incredible and was worth the 3 hours drive each way from Aswan. We went with a driver we arranged per my previous section and honestly is probably the best way to get there. The day was from about 8am-4pm, with 2 hours at the site. 

**Phillae Temple**: A temple on an island accessible from Aswan. I wasn’t sure on how to get here from Aswan without arranging with a tour initially but you can order an In Drive from Aswan easily. After the ticket gate you then have to pay for an inflated-priced boat to the island, not included in the admission ticket. Once outside the site I negotiated with a dodgy taxi driver in a 50 year old car to get back to town, based on the In Drive price I was presented, but I’m quite sure I would have been able to call an In Drive back (and I’d probably recommend that too). 

**Esna Temple**: I call this one out specifically because it’s a less visited temple between Aswan and Luxor we stopped at. It’s a small site but the colours are being restored so it’s super vibrant and beautiful. Strong recommend. 

**Karnak Temple**: A huge site in Luxor, but you can easily get here and back by In Drive. Busy, like everything in Luxor, but it’s huge so you’re not too stifled. 

**Luxor Temple**: Honestly you can see everything from outside so maybe don't bother with a ticket and just walk around the perimeter. Do it at night too where it has nice lighting.

**Dendara and Abydos**. Again these temples are less visited (especially Abydos) but are also awesome, although the two are similar to each other. It’s a long day getting here from Luxor and back, but it was probably our favourite day of templeing in Egypt. 

**Valley of the Kings**: Only call out I want to make here is that you can get extra tickets on top of the normal entry to get into a few more restricted tombs. Some are super expensive but there is one extra ticket we added for the tomb of one of the Ramseses (maybe III?) which was super incredible and worthwhile due to having far less crowds and extremely vivid colours.

# Other points on each city

As mentioned, we stayed in Luxor, Aswan and Cairo. 

In **Cairo**, we stayed at an inexpensive downtown hotel (Hola Hotel, Cairo) which was perfectly fine. I quite recommend staying downtown as there are plenty of restaurants etc around, it’s full of locals rather than tourists so you’re not really so hassled on the street. Getting to Islamic Cairo is very close by Uber (we actually walked all the way there and then Ubered back), and there’s a lot of activity downtown too. Obviously Giza is further but 30 minutes in an Uber isn’t that bad. 

In **Luxor**, we chose to stay on the East Bank, which is the more built up side. Again we stayed in a budget hotel (Nefertiti Hotel) which was also fine. I liked the East Bank because you can easily walk to plenty of restaurants, the markets, or the train or bus station. Luxor is both more and less pleasant than Cairo to walk around in, depending on your demeanour. The roads are less chaotic and it’s definitely prettier, with the wonderful walk down the Nile, but you will be getting approached every minute with something, taxi, shoe shining, souvenirs, some guy saying “I work in your hotel” (he doesn’t) etc. Nothing too pushy but it could be frustrating if you are annoyed by touts. 

In **Aswan**, we stayed on Elephantine Island in a guesthouse. This was awesome and a beautiful change of pace from elsewhere we visited in Egypt. Elephantine Island is mostly a Nubian village on an island off Aswan. Unlike other places where you might deal with touts selling stuff, here you’ll deal with children saying hello, chickens, goats and dirt paths, plus a perplexing number of Jamaican themed cafes and restaurants. There’s also a fancy Mariott hotel which is totally fenced off from the rest of the island, which we learned when we trudged through the jungle trying to use the ATM in their lobby. 

There are two local ferries that go back and forth from Elephantine to the mainland all day for very cheap (10 EGp/$0.20 when we went). The two locations on the mainland are here [https://maps.app.goo.gl/8cLhgxsjBPta1Zay8](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8cLhgxsjBPta1Zay8) and here [https://maps.app.goo.gl/cALhZJrjG5heRjnd9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cALhZJrjG5heRjnd9) One thing to look out for is as you’re walking along the Nile literally every boat guy claims he’s the ferry, so if someone is offering you help, they’re more likely trying to get you on their private boat. The boats are well used by locals so if the boat you’re looking at only has tourists on it it’s probably not the one. 

# Costs

Most things in Egypt we found to be quite inexpensive by western standards.

For basic but clean **hotels**, with included breakfast, we paid like $30-40 a night. I’m sure cheaper options can be found, and you can also pay western prices if you want western brands, but this is the sort of price range we stayed. 

**Food** was quite inexpensive too but like all things it depends. We found food cheapest in Cairo because it was the least touristy. There were some meals we had for literally $1 (koshary) or $2 (shawarma). In restaurants we were still only paying maybe $5-10 each for a decent meal. 

The price of **attractions** for foreigners are similar to what you might pay in Europe etc, but because you find yourself going into many temples, it does add up to more than you might expect. Some examples: going to the pyramids (but not going inside a pyramid) - $13, Luxor Temple $10, the (old) Egyptian Museum $10, the (new) Grand Egyptian Museum $25. Locals and those with an ID card from an Arab country pay far less.

**Transport** was inexpensive other than the overnight sleeper train, see the earlier section. 

And finally the big one people always talk about is **tipping**. I'm no expert and don't come from a tipping country but here is how I handled things:

* Firstly, a general rule everywhere when you travel, anybody that approaches you unsolicited (i.e. not you approaching them) is usually trying to get paid. If you already know this, then you’ll quickly identify that if someone starts showing you around somewhere you didn’t ask or offers to take your photo is looking for tips. As such, you can very easily just say “no thank you” when they start offering their service and you will not feel obligated to give money to people that you’re not wanting to give money to. As such, we didn’t find this a problem, and people leave you alone if they can see you're not interested (and thus aren't going to pay anything).  
* At restaurants, I tipped around 10%. 
* In Ubers, I just rounded the ride up (literally less than a dollar). 
* I gave a tip to the private drivers and the guides we had for those excursions (talking about $5-10 for whole day, although there was one amazing guide we had for one day that we deliberately over-tipped).
* Public toilets (other than in restaurants) have an informal fee which is basically a tip for the attendant who hands out toilet paper and cleans the bathroom. I generally gave them the equivalent of $0.20 to $0.50. 
* Hotel housekeeping I really only felt a need to tip at one place where the housekeeper cleaned the room every day and was a friendly face around the hotel. We paid him $4 directly on the way out. 
* And one general thing. If you tip people, unless you’re tipping a larger amount for someone that’s been with you for a few days, tip in EGP and not in $1 bills or foreign coins. Locals can’t exchange $1 bills and coins so then they have to look for tourists from that country that are willing to exchange for them. So if you see an Egyptian at a tourist site with a wad of dollar bills or a handful of Euro coins saying “change change”, they’re not begging or running some sort of scam, they’re just trying to exchange the money they have for something that they can use. So while I’m sure people won’t say no to your dollar bill, be aware that you’re giving them (and other tourists) more hassle by tipping in this way. 

All in all, Egypt self-guided is not for travel beginners, but is not uniquely difficult. With decent pre-planning and research (not just this post!) IMO it’s perfectly fine to do it yourself. People were friendly, we found it safe and the prices to be reasonable.

Feel free to ask any other logistics type questions, although I may not know the answer. Honestly though the tripadvisor forums on Egypt are a great resource for questions and general reading on self guided travel around Egypt. ",26,0.93,11,2025-03-29 18:58:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jmth0g/my_assorted_tips_after_a_mostly_selfguided_trip/,funfwf

travel,1jo58q6,Best walkable US destinations?,"I may be trying to find a unicorn here but I’m looking for a location - preferably in the northeast USA - but will to fly/leave the country too. 

I want somewhere that’s close enough that we could walk to a beach but also walk to get breakfast/dinner. Walking distance to a playground is a big plus! Basically I don’t really want to have to rely on a car once we are there. 

Will be traveling with my husband and almost 2 year old. Looking to travel over Memorial Day weekend. 

*edit to add: not necessarily looking to swim, but to hang out on a beach. We are from Pennsylvania & have a jersey shore trip booked this summer. So looking for something a little different than that. ",25,0.67,101,2025-03-31 15:00:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jo58q6/best_walkable_us_destinations/,chelsearose0828
