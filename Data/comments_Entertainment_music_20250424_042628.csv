music,1jnnpxb,mklnkqy,"Youtube and Spotify are the 2 worst ways to listen to music. CD's, Apple Music, Tidal, Amazon Music, Qubuz all offer high quality music. It is not snake oil, you can hear it on car radios and earbuds, especially with symbols and voices. But that's just a place to start, lots of music is remastered by default on those platforms. 

CD's started being marketed as remastered in the late 90's so they would be loud enough on crappy boomboxes and CD players, and they almost always ruined the sound quality in the way you describe, loud and boomy and bassy and overproduced with the highs cut off.

music,1jnnpxb,mknchsp,"It was surprising to me to hear this first hand comparing albums from streaming and old albums. I thought it was exaggerated, but comparing two albums were actually different.

I wonder if it is done intentionally? Why would musicians want lower quality versions of their music? Do they alter the music for some reason for different mediums?

music,1jnnpxb,mklxgkc,"For the best quality, you typically want the 24bit versions of songs, which you can stream or purchase online. Not because 24bit is technically better or more capable than 16bit, but rather because we in the audio engineering world put the best sounding masters out as 24bit for discerning listeners, and hyped/mangled versions out as 16 bit and mp3 quality to provide instant gratification for the masses. ""24 bit"" is essentially a proxy for ""we didn't distort the fuck out of this version"".

CD releases will tend to have the same 16bit masters as Spotify/Youtube, just with less artifacts - i.e. they will be just as loud, unless you go hunt secondhand stores for old copies from the early 90s.

Vinyl can *sometimes* sound better than 24 bit releases, but it's fairly rare. Music gets so hugely twisted when physically carved into vinyl that to make a 24 bit digital release sound worse than vinyl, the engineer really has to be a muppet.

There are some esoteric physical formats like dsd, but they are rare and expensive, and of very marginal improvement over a 24bit stream.

Qobuz is my service of choice for 24bit streaming. It's very seldom I find myself wanting to listen to a different master to what they have.",1,2025-03-31 00:30:02,f10101

music,1jmtj31,mkehuoa,"I believe the answer is compression, and the trend towards tighter, more compressed mixes to get the “punchiest” possible sound. Punch = attention grabbing = streams/radio play/etc.

If everything is mixed to be up-front and in your face, a byproduct for some people is that it may also sound flatter and narrower. This is of course far from a universal rule and you can find plenty of current artists creating wide, rich soundscapes. But it’s true as a general trend in mainstream music, and especially rock. 

A good anecdote for this: some buddies and I did mushrooms and put on Abraxas by Santana and went on an absolute journey. When the album ended, it auto-played straight into Smooth by Santana featuring Rob Thomas and the change in vibe was JARRING. Super compressed, tight 2000’s pop. It pulled us right out of the moment and we even started poo-pooing on the decline in quality, but after a minute or so our ears adjusted and we ended up bopping SO hard to Smooth.

This highlights themes of frustration and societal intolerance. This narrative serves as a critique of both the legal system and the violent tendencies of individuals when faced with mundane frustrations, reflecting broader societal issues that remain relevant today.
