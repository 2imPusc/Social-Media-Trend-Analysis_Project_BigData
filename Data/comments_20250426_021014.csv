Local truck driving training school once told me that if they pay to go to school then they automatically pass no matter how bad they are because if the state government pays for it and they don&#39;t pass a certain percentage then they lose State funding. I&#39;ve had absolutely pieces of crap trucks come in there be two or three drivers that run that truck to death under different company names with different drivers in there so they never have to stop. I&#39;ve had regulars who would have a bad accident which would basically bankrupt their company and a week later they&#39;re under a different company name with different insurance and different authority on the road again. I have had on two separate occasions a truck driver have a medical emergency and actually pass away in the truck and 3 days later the company comes pulls him out and throws someone else in there just to keep the truck going. I&#39;ve had other drivers happen to be taken to the hospital for medical reasons and when they come back out of the hospital the truck is gone because they&#39;ve been fired. ...

An automated truck can&#39;t make eye contact with another driver who is waving them out, they could end up stuck at places for ages.

Black holes are created when a star dies and collapses in on itself, which creates a conical hole inside (behind?) the black hole.  It&#39;s a just a big void that keeps getting bigger and bigger.  Our &quot;Big Bang&quot; is described by AI as, &quot;The universe began, scientists believe, with every speck of its energy jammed into a very tiny point. This extremely dense point exploded with unimaginable force, creating matter and propelling it outward to make the billions of galaxies of our vast universe.&quot;  But no one knows why the energy/matter was jammed into that tiny infinitesimal point. And no one knows where that vast amount of energy to came from, to make that tiny dense containment of matter explode so violently.  Maybe our &quot;Big Bang&quot; was the collapse of a SUPER massive star.  And all the matter of that super massive star exploded inwards, inside the black hole, which the collapse created.  And that was the start of our universe.  It would explain 1) Why that dense singular point of energy/matter existed in the first place;  2)  Where that super massive force came from (the force which caused the dense point to explode); 3)  It would explain why our universe is getting bigger (because black holes get bigger over time, too --- although I don&#39;t know where the new matter is going, which the black hole is sucking in).  4)  It aligns with the multiverse theory because our universe itself has black holes.  So black holes can exist within the universes that are inside other black holes.  5)  It might explain what dark matter is.  It&#39;s probably the matter that exists in our parent universe (the universe of that supermassive sun turned into a black hole, spawning our universe).  So our baby universe&#39;s matter + that parent universe&#39;s matter is taking up the same space sort of... but the contents of our black hole universe are sort of outside the fabric of space and time of that older universe.  Right?  (I&#39;m visualizing the space time plane and how black holes have a cone of matter underneath all that space time fabric)  --- I call this theory &quot;Ricky&#39;s Heart Theory&quot; after my husband.

You accomplished this NOT because of your association with the PGA.  It is because of the grass roots content created by you both, along with Grant, Bryson, Paige etc., that so many have been inspired to pursue the game and play in events they may have previously never considered playing in.  As a former college athlete and minor league baseball player, golf was my go to after 20 years in baseball.    Having access to &quot;professional&quot; content like yours has made all the difference in how I have developed my golf game and how my perspective has been changed for the better about the opportunities accessible to me.  For years, I&#39;ve been very disappointed in the PR failures of the PGA Tour.  You might not be willing to direct criticism toward them, but I will.  For too long, this organization has maintained a death grip on its &quot;exclusive club&quot; attitude which, to many, has been very unattractive.  The leadership of the PGA needs to be reminded that the only reason it is successful is because of the players who choose to be a part of it.  Now, with YouTube golf content as well as &quot;other&quot; golf leagues popping up, the PGA has been forced to reevaluate its identity from a public relations perspective.  Its almost as if the PGA Tour didn&#39;t learn its lessons with LIV, now they are making the same mistakes with YT Golf creators.  Makes you smack your own forehead in exasperation.   You guys are what&#39;s good about golf in the age of social media.  Because of the popularity of channels like yours, I am convinced that the PGA will soon be forced to follow suit in how it presents itself via hosted social media content.  Hang in there.

yt_thNHIlphAzA_7590643433883696423,thNHIlphAzA,youtube,"Jesse Lee, the catcher on my slow pitch team, was the “Greatest” catcher in the history of organized sports. He batted in the mid .250s  but his real talent was his defensive prowess. There was never a successful steal or bunt against Jesse Lee. Of course back in the 80s, it was illegal to steal or bunt in slow pitch but that doesn’t change the fact that offensive players never stole or bunted against Jesse. <br>Jesse Lee also played about thirty-two percent of his games sober, and that too might be a record in our league. Added to that sober record, Jesse Lee made eighty-one percent of the return tosses back to the pitcher, and that’s a team record. <br>Jesse Lee also lead the state in softly hit infield ground ball outs by a batter as well as infield pop-up outs by a batter. So that proves Jesse Lee was a dual threat as a hitter and kept the opponents infield honest and busy. <br>It was an honor to play with a catcher with the pure talents that Jesse Lee possessed. And if I’m being honest, the only other catcher in the league that had talents anywhere near the talents of Jesse Lee was “Blind” Al. But “Blind” Al didn’t see it that way. “Blind” Al thought that “Blind” Al was the greatest catcher ever. Man was “Blind” Al arrogant. I mean, how good could “Blind” Al be if he needed someone to hold his hand and lead him around the bases? Our team beat “Blind” Al’s team fifteen head to head games in a row. You would think “Blind” Al’s team would have had a faster outfield since they were all in racing style wheelchairs. Each one of those fifteen consecutive victories were decided by single digits so that proves our team knew how to win close games. And Jesse Lee did his part by upping his batting average to ,268 during the streak. Jesse Was simply built different. 5’5” and about 265 pounds. <br>Yeah, Jesse Lee was the “Greatest” catcher in organized sports.",2025-04-23 07:30:42,7,@brokl26,Unknown

Mr. Matas responded that medical technology was developed to improve people’s health and living standards, but in China it has been abused and used as a tool for large-scale human rights violations and mass killings. He emphasized that in response to this problem, the medical industry and people from all walks of life have begun to take action.<br><br>New legislation has been requested in Japan to ban organ transplant tourism, and many people have contributed by spreading information about the atrocities in China. The film screening emphasized that it is important not to be indifferent to the problem of forced organ harvesting, and everyone should do what they can. It was brought up that it’s crucial that more people pay attention to the issue and take action to promote a resolution to the problem through information dissemination and signature collection campaigns.<br><br>The CCP’s forced organ harvesting was first revealed by witnesses who fled China, and investigations were carried based on their testimonies. Several films have been produced to expose these egregious human rights violations. Although there are few witnesses and evidence is difficult to obtain, many people have put forth great effort to make sure that this issue is not forgotten.<br><br><br>Mr. David Matas<br><br>During the film and ensuing discussion, it was made clear that the issue of forced organ harvesting in China is an organized crime in which the state participates, targeting prisoners of conscience—mainly Falun Gong practitioners. The international community has expressed serious concern about what is happening in China.<br><br>The testimonies of Falun Gong practitioners play an important role in exposing forced organ harvesting. The testimonies indicate that Falun Gong practitioners underwent blood tests in prison, and many practitioners have simply disappeared. This organ transplant compatibility testing is ongoing, and Falun Gong practitioners’ biodata is included in a massive databank.

yt_azLcyJnxGYw_-8042983936666199421,azLcyJnxGYw,youtube,"One very important thing needs to be mentioned when it comes to fps etc. Luke plays the game in 4k. I know there are some who want to tell us that 4k is okay and that it shouldn&#39;t be a problem at all. But unfortunately 4k is the resolution that is to blame for many of today&#39;s problems. GPU development has not yet managed to catch up with 4k. It&#39;s a myth that some streamers, YouTubers and especially retailers want to tell us that 4k is okay. 1080p is still by far the most used resolution. But in my opinion the resolution is no longer up to date. 1440p is up to date. That is the perfect sweet spot today. If we want to talk about bad fps we can&#39;t ignore the resolution. You can&#39;t complain about lousy numbers while at the same time playing at a resolution that no hardware can handle very well. That&#39;s unfair. Yes, 4K works, but it&#39;s incredibly difficult to optimize for consistent, high FPS at such a high resolution. Even talking about 8K is simply absurd. Even 4K should really be postponed for the next few years. If we don&#39;t want that, we&#39;ll just have to forgo various graphical gimmicks.",2025-04-24 15:29:44,0,@TheReitiNo1,Unknown

Also so blatant non calls for the Leafs. It’s funny I see a lot of ppl talking that the Leafs get all the calls but it’s so obvious that they don’t actually watch the Leafs all year because if they did and they weren’t complete morons they’d see that it’s actually the total opposite.<br>Luckily the BETTER team won regardless but the officials and the @NHL both need to step their game up.

Also the caves and dungeons don’t feel real like the did in the original. They feel like geometric shapes still instead of what they did with Skyrim and gave them actual dimensions. And lastly somehow the creatures, even though they look great, they also lack what every life quality the creatures in Skyrim had. Not to mention why do the trolls still race across anywhere they are. Lastly wtf is the running animation?! That is the biggest cardinal sin. Why am I leaning forward so heavily, it looks awful. The game is fun but again it’s missing that life element that they gave to Skyrim. They should just fully remastered Morrowind but then Bethesda would have to actually do work and voice all of the NPCs. Honestly I’d give this remaster a 6 or 7 out of 10.

The let the engine make things realistic instead of tuning it to maximize their own art direction, they let the engine use lumen to do their lighting instead of tuning lumen around their lighting placement, their letting nanite be their optimizer instead of simply letting nanite enhance actual optimization efforts, etc etc. It&#39;s developers not using the tool correctly not that their using a bad tool. It&#39;s like that one friend of yours who always has their shit together and is reliable and dependable so you start leaning on them more but the more you rely on them the more they seem to start to struggle and have things less together - that&#39;s what devs are doing with UE5, they&#39;re leaning on it too much for the things its good at but it&#39;s still only just a game engine at the end of the day and shouldn&#39;t be expected to be able to do everything like that...

Like, if you were a mage you’d have to be like “I better not use magic this level so I can level another attribute”, it just felt like you were disincentivized from playing how you want. I’m super glad they kept the skills and attributes tho, I was afraid they’d do away with it and just have skills like Skyrim.",2025-04-23 15:58:49,1,@TheToxicGunn3r,Unknown

The environs is almost the best part of the game, still. It looks great and is thoroughly enjoyable to explore.<br><br>Combat is soo much smoother this time around, and I can&#39;t tell you how happy I am about about them addressing the issues with scaling and leveling.<br>No more damage sponge enemies of all types at every level. <br><br>I&#39;m at level 10 now and I actually feel as though I&#39;m getting more powerful in the game and isn&#39;t just constantly outmatched like before.<br>I&#39;ve no problem with tougher types of enemies being tough, but I&#39;d rather not get absolutely bodied by a scamp, clannfear or mountain lion at level 10-15 like before.<br>So that&#39;s a marked improvement. And no bandits in daedric armour! Yay!<br><br>And again the environment is gorgeous. And I appreciate the sprint mechanic even if the MC looks dangerously close to naruto-running when doing it.<br><br>Most of my gripes are about the NPC design, the sneaking in of woke subliminal messaging, the uglification of most NPC&#39;s and the female ones in particular and the lack of some options in the CC.<br><br>Like, I would have liked to have the option to actualy choose or sculpt body types. To be able to adjust things like height, frame and general physique.<br><br>I want to play as a potbellied, strongman physique nord conjurer/warlock in heavy armour and hand-to-hand expertize who just plows through enemies like a magical juggernaut up close and Indiana Jones-blasts people at range because he can&#39;t be arsed with running a marathon.<br><br>But no dice. And the game doesn&#39;t change your body as you gain stats either, which is a missed opportunity. <br>You don&#39;t visibly pack on muscle as you gain in strength stats, for example.

yt_4Q4nDw1D8kg_8739653955125361474,4Q4nDw1D8kg,youtube,"People Sign the Petition to Oppose the CCP’s Forced Organ Harvesting<br><br><br><br>People sign the petition to condemn the CCP’s forced organ harvesting.<br><br>On February 22, a woman in Horsens said, “I feel bad. These dead people have no dignity. They are treated like animals by the butchers. They have no identity, no age, no proof, no statement of their wishes before death, or whether they agree to their bodies being exhibited.”<br><br>After a young man signed the petition from the Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting (DAFOH). He said, “My mother just saw the exhibition and took your materials home. After reading the materials carefully, she was shocked and asked me to sign for her. I hope to do my part to support Falun Dafa practitioners’ just actions against the persecution and against organ harvesting.”<br><br>On March 2 in the port city of Frederikshavn, two female doctors working in a hospital saw the problems of the body exhibition clearly with their professional expertise. One said, “As a doctor, I understand the structure of the human body and can see that some of the human specimens have traces of injuries on the bones, indicating that the deceased may have been tortured. Moreover, these corpses are not marked with their source, age, cause of death, purpose of the donor, and other detailed information.<br><br>“From these two points I see, I know what you said is true. These human specimens are questionable.”<br><br>They talked to Falun Gong practitioners who came to the body exhibition to raise awareness of human rights persecution in China and said, “We understand your concerns and support your righteous actions.” They signed the DAFOH petition to support the effort to expose forced organ harvesting.<br><br>At noon, four middle-aged people drove to the exhibition. A practitioner told them, “The exhibition organizer did not show evidence of where these bodies came from. The CCP is currently persecuting Falun Gong and other dissidents, and removing their organs while they are alive for huge profits. These corpse specimens all look like Asians. They are likely to be prisoners of conscience in China, suffering cruel persecution by the CCP’s dictatorship.”<br><br>After they quietly listened, they took the materials and walked into the exhibition hall. But they soon came out.<br><br>One of them said, “We changed our minds and decided not to buy tickets to see the exhibition. We do not support such an exhibition.” They signed the petition and thanked practitioners.<br><br>A couple came out of the exhibition hall and were about to get in their car, when a practitioner told them that the human specimens might be from prisoners of conscience in China, and their organs might have been harvested alive. They were shocked. The woman’s eyes filled with tears and the couple signed the petition.<br><br>After seeing the exhibition, many people signed the petition. Some said, “What you said is true. I support you in exposing the persecution and the organ harvesting.” People talked with practitioners for a long time, and said they wanted to know more about the persecution.<br><br>Many people asked what they could do to help. A practitioner said, “Your signature is a support for us. You can tell your friends and relatives that the CCP persecutes Falun Gong practitioners and other innocent people, and harvests human organs on a large scale and in an organized manner to make huge profits. The bodies in this exhibition might be from prisoners of conscience in China. Let more people know the truth, and we can stop the persecution in China as soon as possible.”<br><br>People were deeply concerned by the cruel human rights violations. Some people suggested that citizens should call for legislation in Denmark so that such controversial exhibitions can be prevented from being held in Denmark in the future.",2025-04-21 08:03:43,0,@EdmurPortuga,Unknown

I am a Filipino from the Philippines, my appeal to the Cardinals in the Vatican Conclave to please DO NOT elect him to become a Pope. Being a Pope is a lifetime commitment, no retirement, work until death, except if he wants to retire early like Pope Benedict the 16th. So it is a huge sacrifice. I want him to be back in the Philippines, to still work for our people and create wonders from God to our people. Please I just want him to live a simple life as a Cardinal in the Philippines, unseen and away from the Vatican and from the world. Let him just live a simple life in the Philippines as a Cardinal please. There are lots of Europeans who want to become a Pope, please give it to them.

Here&#39;s a breakdown of how they compare:<br><br>Tagle: As a Filipino with Chinese roots, he represents the rapidly growing Church in Asia. His election would signal a shift toward the Global South and a more inclusive, missionary Church.<br><br>Sarah: As a Guinean, he also represents the Global South—Africa in particular—but his traditionalist stance may appeal to more conservative factions.<br><br>👉 Advantage: Tagle, because of his broader appeal across progressive and moderate groups.<br><br>🧭 Theological Orientation<br>Tagle: Seen as a continuation of Pope Francis’s vision—pastoral, inclusive, and focused on mercy and dialogue.<br><br>Sarah: A strong voice for orthodoxy and tradition. Often seen as representing a counterweight to Pope Francis’s reforms.<br><br>👉 Advantage: Tagle, especially if the majority of cardinals favor continuity over course correction.<br><br>🗣 Communication &amp; Charisma<br>Tagle: Highly charismatic, multilingual, media-savvy, and emotionally resonant. Often compared to Pope John Paul II for his ability to connect with people.<br><br>Sarah: Intellectual and deeply spiritual, but more reserved and formal in public.<br><br>👉 Advantage: Tagle, especially in today’s media-driven papacy.<br><br>⛪ Curial Experience<br>Tagle: Head of the Dicastery for Evangelization, previously led Caritas Internationalis—he has a strong Vatican and global organizational background.<br><br>Sarah: Former Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship, with deep curial experience and a respected intellect.<br><br>👉 Even, though Tagle’s roles have been more in line with current Vatican priorities.<br><br>Final Verdict:<br>Cardinal Tagle is currently seen as the more viable candidate for pope, especially if the conclave wants a pastoral, globally representative leader who will continue Pope Francis’s emphasis on evangelization, humility, and outreach.<br><br>-(042525 - 1850H Puerto Princesa City, Palawan, Philippines).",2025-04-25 10:53:13,0,@ard8785,Unknown

All for 10-12 euro a ticket too. The cinema cleans up from the bar which is full of people most nights, often people just in for a drink or coffee and not even to see a movie. I think cinemas that are solely relying on Hollywood slop to get bums in seats and selling concessions are in big trouble, I think diversifying is the only way forward, whether that’s by renting out the theatre for events/functions/other uses, making the cinema have another attraction/draw such as a bar, restaurant, cafe, or even something like what my local big chain has done which is open a gaming internet cafe in it (you can rent high-powered PCs to hit the gritty on Fortnight for X amount of hours either alone or with friends).<br><br>Not sure what the solution is but I am happy to see that both the big chain and the art house cinema in my town are hustling and trying to make it work despite the downturn in cinema goers, seems to be working for them both too.",2025-04-25 17:44:34,0,@ohnodominoes,Unknown

You don&#39;t actually have to physically get a library card and borrow a physical copy to do so either.

The streaming services Kanopy and Hoopla allow free streaming of many movies if the library you have a card with participates, and many do. Even movies like Possession are available for me to watch free on Hoopla once I enter my library card number. Not that I&#39;d do that since I own the movie, but just an example. Good for some obscure stuff you might not find on other services at least.

But people say that they don&#39;t have the money to care for foreign aid. That they should concentrate on domestic issues first. But this is not the case. America is the richest country on earth. America has the money as a whole. Yes, the billionares own it, you don&#39;t. But it is still a rich country&#39;s obligation to support poor countries. You are responsible for your own governments policies. It is not poor country&#39;s fault that they are poor, just like it is not your achievement that you were born in a rich country. Where you&#39;re born is just pure luck, chance. So, if you&#39;re poor in America, you should make the rich pay more for foreign aid. That is the solution for you. Remember in 2023, America ranks only 16th paying 193.1$ a year of foreign aid each. You haven&#39;t been that much contributing compared to 15 other countries (even though 193.1$ does seem like a lot if you&#39;re poor), and still America has backed down extremely heavily since the end of January this year. Moral is something that you should never back down on. USAID saved lives. You have got to find a way to revive USAID as soon as possible, because it is impacting severely. Read NYT&#39;s article on 19th about effects in Sudan. Remember, when somebody dies, you can never meet or speak to that person forever. Death of somebody close, is something that can not be overcome. You wish to say more, and do more for that person, but you can&#39;t. You think of how good that person was, although you didn&#39;t tend to see it that way. This is why, we should do everything we can to tell the person we care about, that we care, as much as possible while they are alive. Otherwise, you will regret a regret that can never be saved, because that person is dead. But shutting down USAID is forcing hundreds of thousands of people to experience this, and the people dead went through more. An extreme amount of people are suffering. Genocide is something that must not exist. There is no point in life, if you don&#39;t oppose to genocide. We must protest against USAID destruction, and make the rich pay for foreign aid.",2025-04-25 18:32:40,0,@aa-rd1em,Unknown

This word describes where Herr Trump and his MAGA sycophants are taking America. The definition and implementation should feel very familiar.<br><br>Patrimonialism is the style of governance based on proximity and loyalty of an individual to the ruler. Power and prestige is handed out not by merit but by one’s relationship to the ultimate authority. Examples of past regimes include monarchies, dictatorships, and organized crime families. Modern examples still abound within corporations and family run businesses. I’m not convinced that Trump himself set out to turn America into a Patrimonial State. That would require thought and pre-meditation. He just simply is trying to run America like The Trump Organization.<br><br>The uniqueness of the Trump Era is the scale by which Patrimonialism is being implemented in the size of a liberal democracy like America. Liberal Democracies started the trend to replace patrimonial states as recently as the Kaiser Monarchy in Prussia. One must remember that modern liberal democracies are a recent phenomenon. Why is America moving in this direction? One hypothesis is the decline of the church leaving the population a sense of disconnectedness so they turn to the cult of personality as a replacement.<br><br>The reality of appointing loyalists over merit to governing positions; the ruler quickly discovers that running a modern state requires many subject matter experts. The candidate shortlist that is both a sycophant and the necessary subject matter expert becomes very short. The Patrimonialist will defer to the loyalist every time. This in turn leads to one of the two weaknesses of this governing style.<br><br>First is the lack of necessary competence in the right place with the right people is a hallmark of this political system. Manifestation of this consequence is the recent invasion of Russia into Ukraine where Putin expected the takeover to last mere days. He’s now entering his third year while nearing a million casualties of his own military. His Generals were all promoted into their positions first by their loyalty and their perceived minimal threat to ruler Putin.<br><br>Second, the other Achilles Heel to this governing style is corruption. It essentially becomes automatic when bureaucrats serve the leader instead of for the people. Wealth and power is doled out based on proximity to the great leader while the lower ranks suffer. The term “Banana Republic” is the derisive term used to describe such a state. Promotions and rewards are given based on personal connections so the others get creative. This creativity manifests itself for example as in the early days of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Apparently a 40 Km Russian military convoy was stalled inside of Ukraine due to the disintegration of Chinese made tires on many of the transports. The funds meant to replace these tires were syphoned off by mid ranking officers for cash on the black market. Now extend this behaviour throughout a society and you get a sense of the current challenges before the Russian people.<br><br>According to historians, citizens will feel the effects of incompetence first but it’s the inherit corruption that will bring down a Patrimonial regime. Your evening news is showing you the start of Trump’s implementation of the Patrimonial State. The drama will be in how the Americans remove this threat to their democracy. Most Patrimonial States were taken down internally by the unveiling of its corruption over time.",2025-04-25 16:47:31,0,@BlackDragonCrusader,Unknown

I checked Wikipedia, but the explanation on Wikipedia was as messy as the hair on Uncle Chuan&#39;s head. So I had to analyze it myself. I first dug out the definitions and characteristics of isms, religions, extreme religions, and cults, and then compared them with Trumpism. The result was that it had nothing to do with isms, but it was 90% similar to cults.<br>Think about it, Trump believes everything MAGA says. Chinese people who have read history know that the Boxers were fooled by the leader and said that they would be invulnerable to swords and guns. Didn&#39;t they believe it? Did they really believe it? When they were fighting against the Eight-Nation Alliance, they went to the front line every day and were shot by the enemy&#39;s modern guns and cannons, but they were still waving big swords and charging forward<br>If there is any influential platform willing to discuss this issue and angle, I am happy to provide theoretical support",2025-04-25 16:31:59,0,@蒲曲波,Unknown

I am a Filipino from the Philippines, my appeal to the Cardinals in the Vatican Conclave to please do not elect him to become a Pope. Being a Pope is a lifetime commitment, no retirement, work until death, except if he wants to retire early like Pope Benedict the 16th. So it is a huge sacrifice. I want him to be back in the Philippines, to still work for our people and create wonders from God to our people. Please I just want him to live a simple life as a Cardinal in the Philippines, unseen and away from the Vatican and from the world.

Here&#39;s a breakdown of how they compare:<br><br>Tagle: As a Filipino with Chinese roots, he represents the rapidly growing Church in Asia. His election would signal a shift toward the Global South and a more inclusive, missionary Church.<br><br>Sarah: As a Guinean, he also represents the Global South—Africa in particular—but his traditionalist stance may appeal to more conservative factions.<br><br>👉 Advantage: Tagle, because of his broader appeal across progressive and moderate groups.<br><br>🧭 Theological Orientation<br>Tagle: Seen as a continuation of Pope Francis’s vision—pastoral, inclusive, and focused on mercy and dialogue.<br><br>Sarah: A strong voice for orthodoxy and tradition. Often seen as representing a counterweight to Pope Francis’s reforms.<br><br>👉 Advantage: Tagle, especially if the majority of cardinals favor continuity over course correction.<br><br>🗣 Communication &amp; Charisma<br>Tagle: Highly charismatic, multilingual, media-savvy, and emotionally resonant. Often compared to Pope John Paul II for his ability to connect with people.<br><br>Sarah: Intellectual and deeply spiritual, but more reserved and formal in public.<br><br>👉 Advantage: Tagle, especially in today’s media-driven papacy.<br><br>⛪ Curial Experience<br>Tagle: Head of the Dicastery for Evangelization, previously led Caritas Internationalis—he has a strong Vatican and global organizational background.<br><br>Sarah: Former Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship, with deep curial experience and a respected intellect.<br><br>👉 Even, though Tagle’s roles have been more in line with current Vatican priorities.<br><br>Final Verdict:<br>Cardinal Tagle is currently seen as the more viable candidate for pope, especially if the conclave wants a pastoral, globally representative leader who will continue Pope Francis’s emphasis on evangelization, humility, and outreach.<br><br>-(042525 - 1850H Puerto Princesa City, Palawan, Philippines).",2025-04-25 10:56:14,0,@ard8785,Unknown
