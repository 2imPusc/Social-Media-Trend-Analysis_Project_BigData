1k0012b,reddit,What movies did you cry at that aren't exactly tearjerkers,"We all know the big tearjerker movies: Up and Schindler's List and all accompanying Pixar/Holocaust movies. They tell stories that are highly charged with emotion and thus lend themselves to making the audience cry. But then there are movies where crying is seemingly not the intention, and yet you can't help but feel your eyes well up in tears.

The Godfather Part 2 is called a lot of things: The best sequel ever made, one of the best movies of the 70's, The Great American Movie. But a tearjerker? From the outset it doesn't really look it. And yet, if you find yourself sucked into Michael Corleone's inner turmoil as I was, it becomes surprisingly easy to become emotional the further along you go in. ESPECIALLY when>!Michael gives the implicit order to kill Fredo, and before he meets his inevitable fate, his attempts to connect with Michael's son.!<I'll admit, I wept.

1jro1ng,reddit,What movies did you see when you were way too young for them?,"What film, for whatever reason, just stays with you constantly because you saw it way, way too young to either ""get"" it, or it was just too much for a undeveloped brain?

\-----------

There's plenty of films that scarred me, etc. I picked out Friday the 13th Part 2 for a sleep over at like 10 years old. No bueno. Here's a bunch of cover art from VHS store horror movies I compiled, FWIW: [https://imgur.com/gallery/vhs-horror-movie-cover-art-that-enthralled-captivated-you-youth-from-late-70s-to-early-90s-9L046CH](https://imgur.com/gallery/vhs-horror-movie-cover-art-that-enthralled-captivated-you-youth-from-late-70s-to-early-90s-9L046CH)

But I'm not talking about horror, vs just not ""getting it"" or having adult themes way out of your league?

The one film I saw because ""cute robots"" was **Silent Running by Douglas Trumbull**, starring Bruce Dern. Almost feels like a spiritual ancestor of High Life in one sense, but like things that made you who you are... Fred Rogers, Carl Sagan, etc... this film gave me a presence of mind about nature that I learned way too young. It's at the core of how I behave and treat this planet... 

But it shattered and broke me. I know Huey's forest is still out there, but when Louie died, and when Dern says goodbye to the robots... I mean, it was just pure trauma for my child mind.

I wonder what other people saw that just anchored into their soul or heart, or became the basis for their fears or weird stuff, all because you saw it too young?",2025-04-04 22:04:43,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,154,682,,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jro1ng/what_movies_did_you_see_when_you_were_way_too/,unclefishbits

But you know what it is in your soul, like a resonance within yourself. I know it sounds corny and tacky. But Inside Llewelyn Davis is like no other movie I’ve ever seen. It is an experience I will carry with me forever.
By the end of the movie I felt empty, confused, and kind of let down as many others Im sure have felt. But as my day went on and I reflected over what I had watched, that feeling started to grow. And gets only stronger whenever I think back to the movie, the themes and its plot. This is the only experience I’ve ever had like this and I’m curious if anyone else has something similar with this film or another.

Here are a few I’ve seen recently:

Incantation – Loved the atmosphere and presentation, especially how it played with curses and audience interaction. It was really well done… but honestly, not that scary.

Longlegs – Cinematography and storytelling were top-notch, and I was hooked the whole time. But that ending... when it boiled down to *""the devil made me do it""*, it just killed it for me. I’m not into supernatural explanations that feel like a cop-out.

Gonjiam: Haunted Asylum – This one was solid, especially for found footage. Great pacing, great use of the setting. I want more like this. (But it wasn't scary at all)

**NGL**, for me, the top two that have had this lasting effect are hands down  **The Truman Show** and **Westworld (the series)**.

They seriously messed with my head back when I watched them, and even now, years down the line, I still get this lingering, creepy feeling sometimes. It planted this seed of doubt... like, **what if I'm just an NPC?** What if most of us regular folks are just background characters in some massive simulation or game?

It's made me look at the world differently ever since. Maybe those super-rich people or powerful politicians constantly **on the feed** aren't just regular people, but the actual players? The ones with **P2W (Pay-to-Win)** advantages, or maybe even avatars controlled by the **devs/admins** running the whole show, walking among us **IRL**?

It's a properly chilling thought that these movies planted in my brain all that time ago, and it genuinely still gives me goosebumps just thinking about it.

The performances are superb. Noah Hathaway is extraordinary, he carries most of the film, conveying his acting with great committment.

1jyhcp4,reddit,Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid appreciation post,"I'm watching this movie again and I just... wow.

I. Love. This. Film.

I grew up in a ""movie family,"" with my dad quoting both famous and obscure films left and right throughout my childhood. He quoted this one *a lot* (specifically, ""I didn't know you were the Sundance Kid when I said you were cheating""). Those quotes often led to the realization that his delivery sometimes was considerably better than the reality of whatever movie he was quoting, LOL

This, this right here, is the #1 exception. 

When I finally sat down and watched it at 16 or 17 (early aughts), I remember being blown away. This is one of the only movies that has retained that wonder for me over 20+ years now - I turn 40 this year.

I'm not saying there aren't absolutely valid criticisms. There are. But this post is just about appreciating a film where, IMHO, the actors and the script and the cinematography are all nearly perfect.

And the LINES. Just... I could quote this film forever. Which is wild because the script is in itself pretty sparse.

""I CAN'T SWIM!""
""Who ARE those guys?""
""You just keep thinkin', Butch, that's what you're good at.""
""Rules! In a knife fight?!""

* Ability to see the solutions to previous games
* Sort actors & movies alphabetically and chronologically
* Hovering over or selecting an image will show the movie title/actor name.
* We also made [TV Circuit](http://wfhgames.com/tv-circuit) after getting a lot of requests for it. I think it tends to be a bit harder than Cinema Circuit.

However it came out when anti-war sentiment was at an all time high and it flopped hard, I have seen figures stating it took no more than £100,000 when it was released at the cinema. It is also historically important as some of the budget was spent on restoring WW2 aircraft that had been left to rot.

1jkfptq,reddit,'The Assessment' was really good and it's a shame no one is seeing it,"So this just came out last weekend, I had never even heard of it until the week before when I saw a trailer in the theater and thought it looked intriguing, come to find out it made all of $152K this weekend from less than 300 theaters. I'm kind of baffled as to why; this has a really strong visual presentation, three recognizable actors giving very good performances, and a really compelling hook. The only reason I could imagine it not clicking with a bigger audience is because it gets darker than I expected, but I'm shocked that this seemingly just slipped completely under the radar, especially because it seems like the kind of movie this sub will inevitably come across as a 'hidden gem' in the next few years.

There's definitely an obvious comparison to be made to *Ex Machina* just in the fact that they're both seven day sci-fi experiments set in a futuristic location starring Alicia Vikander, but these are very, very different films beneath the surface. There's a LOT more going on in this film than I expected, and one thing I really have to say is that it feels like the kind of premise that in the hands of another filmmaker could've very easily become one-note or repetitive, but I never felt as though this did. I was really surprised how much depth they managed to give to all three main characters, and how many themes they managed to explore in ways that actually felt meaningful.

There's definitely some visual elements and ideas that feel as though they were inspired by other films (namely one room in the house that feels very reminiscent of *Blade Runner 2049*), but there's still something really fresh about this that feels like it's coming from a new voice.

If you have a chance, I'd definitely recommend checking it out.

1jy9fkv,reddit,The Lives of Others (2006) is incredible,"The Lives of Others, or *Das Leben der Anderen*, is a German movie that came out to a lot of critical acclaim in 2006, and eventually won the Best International Film Oscar over Pan's Labyrinth. I finally got around to watching it, and ended up loving it. Highly recommended to anyone looking for an intelligent, mature historical drama with fantastic performances

The summary is as follows: In 1983 East Berlin, dedicated Stasi officer Gerd Wiesler begins spying on a famous playwright and his actress-lover Christa-Maria. Wiesler becomes unexpectedly sympathetic to the couple, and faces conflicting loyalties when his superior takes a liking to Christa-Maria.

While the above makes the movie sound like a spy thriller, it really is more of a character study with social commentary. There are some thriller-esque elements to it, and the movie *can* be pretty tense at times - this isn't really the focus however, as it's more concerned with making a point about the impact of a political and socially repressive regime on its people, whether they're against it or are complicit in supporting it. 

The performances are what really make this such a great experience. Ulrich Mühe as Wiesler is fantastic, especially considering how restrained and low-key the role is. He expresses so much with just his eyes and facial expressions alone. It almost feels like he created this entire person on screen without saying a single word about his personality, because pretty much all of his dialogue is strictly about the work he does. Sebastian Koch and Martina Gedeck are really good in their roles as well.

This is definitely a slow-burn narrative that grows in power and impact as it moves along. Honestly, for the first hour or so, I thought it was just ""good"" - well-acted and directed, but not really exceptional in any way. But halfway through, it hits another gear, the screws are tightened around the characters and it gradually transforms into a tense, anxiety-inducing story before eventually ending up as a bittersweet tragedy. 

I also have to applaud the ending, as it's one of the most cathartic and emotional conclusions to a movie I've seen in a while. The scene in the bookstore, with Wiesler going ""it's for me"" and the camera freezing on his face for a while - just beautifully done.

1jtnmr2,reddit,George of the Jungle appreciation,"I've been going through childhood movies (posted last time about Kung Pow) and trying to view them through the lense of an adult. Watched George of the Jungle today which was one I loved as a kid. The movie is underappreciated and underrated. Yes, it's insanely stupid. Yes, it has a lot of low hanging fruit humor. Yes it's a lot of physical gags. But... It's executed so well. I don't know how any of the actors filmed that movie with a straight face especially with any scene involving Brendan Frasier because he's so over the top. The humor as an adult is great because so much shit flew over my head as a kid. The 4th wall breaking is also great. I also didn't realize this was a Disney film and I can't believe they greenlit something that not only lampoons their own IP, but also has so many gags that would be normal in something like Scary Movie.

With 2025's slate of releases slowly taking shape, I've been thinking about which upcoming film has me most excited to be in a theater again. Between delayed productions finally seeing the light of day, unexpected sequels, and original visions from visionary directors, this year is shaping up to be incredible for cinema.
I'm curious what everyone else is looking forward to! Is it Villeneuve's mysterious new sci-fi project? The long-awaited adaptation of that unfilmable novel? That indie director finally getting a proper budget? The continuation of a beloved franchise?

What movie has you marking your calendar and saving your opening night ticket money? And what specifically about it has captured your imagination? The director? The cast? The source material? Or something else entirely?

1jzpi3y,reddit,"Boiling Point (2021) pulls off a 90 minute single take and is probably my favorite movie with this ""gimmick""","Decided to watch this after being super impressed with director Philip Barantini's work on the Netflix show Adolescence. The way he stages and blocks his actors in order to pull off this technical feat is nothing short of brilliant. The movie is incredibly tense, set in a single night in a busy restaurant, and the camerawork massively contributes to this overwhelming sense of dread that lingers over every scene. Stephen Graham and Vinette Robinson are absolutely magnetic as the head chef and sous chef, Robinson especially absolutely kills it during this one scene where she delivers the most realistic frustrated monologue I think I've ever watched (I think she flubs a couple lines but it added to the sense of realism, I often stumble over my words when angry, too). I've seen a few films that try this same gimmick - Birdman is fantastic, Victoria is awesome, 1917 is masterful. But while those movies are technical marvels in their own rights and maybe manage to pull off some flashier camera moves, none of them made me feel as claustrophobic and tense as this one. The simple, familiar setting, the naturalistic dialogue where people talk over each other and fumble their words, the sound design emphasizing the bustle of a busy restaurant. All of it gels into a single 90 minute heart attack, in the spirit of the Safdie Brothers.",2025-04-15 11:30:10,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,94,64,,0.79,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jzpi3y/boiling_point_2021_pulls_off_a_90_minute_single/,letsgopablo

1k0wubp,reddit,Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is about breaking the cycle and growing instead of getting into another one,"I often heard the opinion that the last scene of the movie is a subtle hint of how Joel and Clem get into another cycle of erasing themselves. And while I understand the logic of why people read it like this, I still feel that something is off with that interpretation.

If you didn’t know, in the [original](https://collider.com/eternal-sunshine-of-the-spotless-mind-original-ending/#:~:text=Eternal%20Sunshine%20of%20the%20Spotless%20Mind%27s%20original%20script%20had%20a,from%20a%20more%20cynical%20perspective) script the ending is a scene 50+ years after where Clem erases Joel for the 15th time while Joel leaves her audio messages asking why she's ignoring him, and Mary is assisting Clem.

It’s just that initially in the director’s mind, the movie was supposed to be a little more realistic and gritty. If we look at a few deleted scenes, we learn and see more of Naomi’s character, previous Joel’s girlfriend whom he mentions at the beginning of the movie. I think they’ve cut the crucial [scene](https://youtu.be/ovxHfv8CR0s?si=e_yjpfzwmLCo1peq) of Joel and Naomi’s breakup, where Naomi highlights to Joel that ""the thing is, whatever you think it is you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off - you're still Joel with the same problems"". I think this scene is crucial to understanding the difference between Joel's character before and after the erasure process.

When we see Lacuna Inc. for the first time, it seems like a fully legitimate business that's been functioning successfully for some time already, and there's not much to go wrong with the procedure. But the thing is, they are failing big time with Joel, Clem, and Mary, all at the same time.

With Clem, it goes wrong when creepy Patrick tries to stage ""love"" by using the things Joel was doing and saying before the erasure, and it seemingly rubs Clem off. With Joel, it goes wrong when he literally tries to stop the erasure process and tries to hide Clem in his deepest traumatic memories, and they erase Clem with the memories that weren't supposed to be erased at all.

And especially wrong it goes with Mary, who at first is the most enthusiastic of all about erasing memories. Suddenly she gets the real disgusting taste of it when she learns that she erased memories of her previous affair with Dr. Mierzwiak. And even more, in the [alternative](https://youtu.be/rb5R2MsQkxI?si=GQ6DzF-zYQpe4wPw) deleted scene Mary was supposed to learn that Mierzwiak got her pregnant and also convinced her to have an abortion before erasing her memory. Imagine what a shock this is for a character, to learn that you had an abortion, and don't even remember that.

But still, it's Joel at the center of the story, the main accent of the story is on Joel, how he behaves, and how he interprets things.

People love to point out that after the erasure process, Joel goes to Montauk again, and repeats the same steps... But he is not. This is a different Joel after the erasure.

If you really compare Joel before and after the erasure, you'll notice the real difference. Let's break it chronologically:

\- Joel meets Clem in Montauk, and they spend some time together. But then when Clem suggests spending more time together and going crazy, Joel freaks out and runs off. He later regrets running off, as he explains it while he's in his mind.

>I don't know. I felt like a scared little kid. I was like... It was above my head. I don't know. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation, I think. You said ""So go"" with such disdain, you know?

It's the very first case when Joel's insecurity cause issues and friction in his relationship with Clem.

\- Joel approaches Clem in the library trying to ask her out to go somewhere. Clem gives him her famous ""I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours"". In his mind, Joel confesses that even after that speech he still thought that Clem would save his life.

\- Then Joel breaks up with Naomi to be together with Clem.

\- We don't know if Joel had any other relationships before Naomi, but Naomi's phrase about Joel dragging his problems in every relationship assumes that if there were other relationships, Joel kind of was already in his own loop of constantly ruining relationships with his insecurities.

\- Joel and Clem get together, and as Naomi predicts, after the thrill wears off, Joel ruins it with his own jealousy and insecurities. It makes Clem go and erase him.

\- In an impulsive act, Joel goes to erase Clem too, but then he sabotages it, and he erases core child trauma memories that were causing his insecurities when he was with Clem.

\- After the erasure, by some miracle, Joel goes to Montauk and has his ""second"" first meeting with Clem there. But while Joel is depressed by having blank 2 years of his life (erased), you can notice that he's not that insecure anymore. After the conversation with Clem on the train, it's Joel who offers her a ride. It's wild to compare this Joel to the one who ran off from Clem in the beginning, you know? This New Joel even spends some time at Clem's home, and then when he comes home, he's waiting for a phone call from Clem with excitement.

\- Literally second meeting/date with Clem, they go to lie on the ice lake. While Joel is a bit unsure about this idea, he doesn't run off, and he goes along with it. He's *enthusiastic* about it. Again, compare it to the insecure Joel who literally left Clem alone in that house in Montauk.

\-After that in the morning Joel has enough self-security admitting ""I had the best fucking night of my entire fucking life"".

\-Joel loses it for a bit after the truth comes out, but to be honest, who wouldn't lose it like that in such a situation?

And the final scene in the apartment. New Joel listens to all those wild things his older version is saying, and he wants to fall through the ground out of shame. He's so uncomfortable while listening to it. When he says ""I wouldn't think that about you"", it's not just *words*. Now he's literally secure enough not to think such wild and evil things in his head.

It's the scene where you can see this huge gap, this huge difference between the Old Joel and the New Joel. The last words we hear from the tape while Clem is going out is ""I thought I knew her so well. But I don't know her at all. What a loss to spend that much time, only to find out that she's a stranger.""

It's the old Joel who spent so much time with her but didn't really know her in the end. And the new Joel isn't like that at all.

The final scene in the corridor mirrors the library scene they had before, and it's crucial to understand the difference here. Clem repeats her famous ""I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind"". And while Old Joel was still hoping that Clem would ""save"" him even after that speech, the New Joel was just literally exposed to the nastiest shit they had in their relationship. At this point, there's no illusion about ""saving"" anyone. New Joel says ""Okay"" as now he's secure enough to face all the imperfections he'll see down the road.

And getting back to Mary for a bit, think about the contrast. In the original script, she was still working in Laguna Inc many years later. In the movie, she's already been in the cycle of repeating her affair with Dr. Mierzwiak for an indefinite amount of time. But this final time, she learns the truth, and whether it's just an affair, or abortion in the more gritty version of the movie, she decides to break the cycle. She sends everyone's tapes back to them, and the damage it will cause to the company is hard to define. Whether it's just an affair or an abortion, at this point Mary doesn't want to have any business with Mierzwiak or the whole erasure procedure again. She burns the bridges.

And overall it raises an interesting conflict of ideas. While the original script is trying to prove that people don't change, and Clem and Joel would go into a repeating cycle, the movie tries to prove the opposite. The movie tries to prove that while people are messy and imperfect, there's still a chance for a brighter future as long as people are open enough to face the harsh truth.",2025-04-16 22:05:02,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,88,9,,0.85,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1k0wubp/eternal_sunshine_of_the_spotless_mind_is_about/,PIRATEOFBADIM

1jxvqxf,reddit,The Back to the Future Trilogy. The perfect trilogy.,"Today is day two of a three day BTTF rewatch. Yesterday i watched BTTF, i've just finished watching BTTF 2 and tomorrow i'll watch 3.

I have seen all three films multiple times, I have read and watched all sorts of behind the scenes trivia and details about them. I know these films and yet they, especially 2, are flawless. I know what to look for, the subtle clues that all is not as it seems and even knowing what i'm looking at and where I still either don't notice or it's not distracting.

For example i know at some point Marty appears to have three hands, i didn't notice as I was so engrossed in the film I forgot to look.

The dinner scene is still my favourite scene, it is so perfect, you have three copies of Michael J. Fox interacting around the same table and even knowing that and seeing the scene multiple times over pretty much all my life I still find it utterly perfect. As a young child I didn't realise Marlene was also played by Michael J. Fox, i thought they got an actress in. I realised later on though, possibly the third or fourth time I watched it,

There is a scene just as they arrive back in 1985 and the car lands and turns into a driveway, in real life this is a model landing then the lamppost is used to cover up the transition between model and real car yet it is superb, i have watched the scene many times and yet its perfect, it is so smooth. [See it here](https://youtu.be/rhNDsPMaK_A?t=454) I have watched it frame by frame and it's still flawless. 

Then there are the plot threads, there are no loose ends, it just all works, there are elements used from the first film and in 2 there are setups for scenes in 3. Everything is neat, Well apart from the second car in the third film but i'm sure the lack of spare parts for a DeLorean in the 1950s stopped them from cannibalising it for parts, it's mostly just an educated guess though.

I love the first film, I do, the little changes in the 1980s setup in the 1950s are really quite nice and they add much to a rewatch. Like I said though, the second film is the best, utterly amazing, some of the effects are a bit dated but so are the effects in Jason and the Argonauts and I still watch that. I'm not going to criticise any old film for dated effects, it's not like they had access to modern tech.

Anyway if, for some bizarre reason, you have not seen these films go and watch them.",2025-04-13 00:44:20,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,88,43,,0.74,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jxvqxf/the_back_to_the_future_trilogy_the_perfect_trilogy/,Martipar

1k71c2e,reddit,"In Casino, why did Ace trust Ginger when it was clear she shouldn't/couldn't be trusted?","At the beginning of Casino, there's a voiceover of Ace where he says, ""When you love someone, you gotta trust them, there's no other way. You've got to give them the key to everything that's yours. Otherwise, what's the point? And for a while, that's the kind of love I believed I had"". 

How did Ace ever trust Ginger as much as he did? He's a smart guy, and suspicious of everyone. He knew she was a hustler/grifter. And there are moments pretty early on where she blatantly lies to him or cheats him--when she takes money for a drink and doesn't give him change and says she spent it on some tables on the way back; when she calls Lester after their wedding. 

I don't get why he was so blind to her being untrustworthy to the point he gives her the only key to the money that might need to be used to get him out of trouble. (And I'm surprised she didn't take any of it before the end of things.)

Am I missing something--why did Ace think he had the kind of love where he could trust her with everything when she never showed herself to be worthy of that trust in the first place?

This is 70's anime. When animation was still colored flat. And this movie still looks like a masterpiece. The background art is so gorgeous and lovely.


Cagliostro feels so green and lush and cozy. Which is a classic Miyzaki trademark. The aesthetuc choices for the enviorment deisgn is just magnificent.

1jtuoqr,reddit,How a friendly grandmother's daily walks indirectly gave WALL-E its voice,"In the fall of 2004, I had just moved 2000 miles to northern California to start my new job in the animation industry. Each weekend, I would visit my grandmother who lived in Marin county and spend the day with her. My grandmother was an amazing woman, she was the type who kept detailed notes of all your preferences so she could provide the best experiences for her guests. For example, each time I visited, she had made my favorite sandwich with the exact proportions of condiments and meats I preferred with absolutely no tomatoes anywhere nearby, purchased my favorite soda (she would never keep soda in her own fridge as she did not like it, so she always bough one fresh the day I visited), and have a selection of candies I liked (or at least which she remember I liked from when I was 5). One of our favorite things to do together was walk through her neighborhood and talk with her neighbors. My grandmother lived in her neighborhood for nearly 30 years, and her husband had lived there for 80 years, so between them they knew the history of every house and of her friends inside. She walked her neighborhood every day, and each time she saw someone outside of their house she would stop and talk with them. If she knew someone’s daily schedule she would time her walks so that she would see them outside and conveniently have their favorite cookies with her to give to them. Each weekend, my grandmother and I would walk the one mile loop and she gave me updates on all her neighbors, which numbered at least 30 families. As we passed each house, she’d tell me whose kids just got into college, who changed jobs, the successes of each kid, their favorite foods and movies, etc. She was like a living newsletter, and I loved hearing my grandmother excitedly tell each story. 


One day during our walk, she was giving me the latest scoop on her neighbor Ben, a kind man with a wonderful wife and lovely young daughter, who creates sounds for movies. As we approached Ben’s house, a car pulled into his driveway directly in front of us and a man in his 50s stepped out. “Oh, hey, that’s Ben,” she said, waving to him as he walked to open his passenger-side door. He turned to us, smiled, said “hi”, and as he opened his passenger-side door, out tumbled his laptop, crashing onto the concrete with the screen still open. He shouted a boomer-sanitized expletive and I instinctively rushed over to help him pick it up. As I did, I glanced at the screen.

What I saw stopped me in my tracks: two figures were battling with glowing swords over a river of lava. I immediately recognized it as the ending duel from *Episode III: Revenge of the Sith*. Now, this was September 2004 and that movie wasn’t due out until May 2005. This was the biggest movie everyone was talking about and counting down to. Fans knew that the end of the movie was supposed to be a climatic duel between Obi-wan and Anakin on the lava planet of Mustafar which leads to the creation of Darth Vader as we know him, but everyone was guessing how it would happen. Any hint of leaks were highly valued and reported on sites like Ain’t It Cool News, Dark Horizons, and ComingSoon.net. A modern equivalent would be to unknowingly stumble upon the “On your left” portals scene from Avengers Endgame 8 months before it came out. And here I was, staring at the scene I had been imagining ever since I read about Darth Vader’s origins nearly two decades earlier.


That’s when I realized that “Ben” wasn’t just any neighbor. He was [*Ben Burtt*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Burtt), the legendary sound designer behind the *Star Wars* and *Indiana Jones* franchises. He created the sounds of lightsabers, R2-D2’s beeps, Indy’s whip, Darth Vader’s breathing, and even secretly inserted the “[Wilhelm scream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YDpuA90KEY)” into his movies which led to its modern popularity. He shaped the audio landscape of every major Lucasfilm movie and show for decades. But to my grandmother, who hadn’t watched any of those films, he was just “Ben”, the friendly neighbor with a lovely wife and daughter. 


I gasped, “Holy cow, that’s *Episode III*,” and Ben quickly shut the laptop and tried to do a Jedi mind trick of telling us it was not what we thought it was. I backed off, understanding the sensitivity of what I'd seen and how his literal job was at stake. My grandmother, ever the social butterfly, then introduced us properly, and we got to talking. I mentioned that I just started working in the industry and we shared stories. Ben invited us inside, introduced us to his wife and daughter, and even showed us his [Oscars](https://postimg.cc/yWW7D52w). After a pleasant visit, we thanked him and continued on our neighborhood loop. I was over the moon about the experience, and my grandmother was just happy to have been able to talk to her friends, and to see me happy too. 


At the start of the story I mentioned I had just started working in the animation industry. Well, that was somewhat burying the lede, because the next part is how we get to Wall-E:


At that time, I was working at Pixar Animation Studios on the movie which would eventually become *Ratatouille*. But that movie was still years away, instead, Pixar’s next movie, *The Incredibles*, was about to release in a couple weeks. Soon after my interaction with Ben, Pixar held the “[Cast and Crew](https://postimg.cc/f3BhLjCz)” screening of *The Incredibles* where all the people who worked on the film [came together](https://postimg.cc/gX7Fyz11) and watched the final product. Along with all the artists and developers, the voice cast was there, as were [Steve Jobs, Ed Catmull, John Lasseter, and Brad Bird](https://postimg.cc/pmMv1dyH). The movie played to thunderous applause, and people cheered when [ahem] *incredibly* difficult technical scenes were shown, such as when Mr. Incredible arrives on the island via an underwater path and all the water drains from the hangar.

At the end of the crew screening, John Lasseter announced that “Friends and Family screenings would begin in two weeks”. These were preview screenings shown at the Pixar building where the crew could invite anyone to see the movie weeks before it came out. I remembered Ben’s daughter was really excited about The Incredibles, so on my next walk with my grandmother we went to his house where I invited his family to join the “Friends and Family” screening.


The day of the friends screening [arrived](https://postimg.cc/DmDnL6Tm) and I met Ben and his family at the [Emeryville studio](https://postimg.cc/K17bXygg). Before the movie started I gave them a tour of all the areas which guests were allowed to visit and showed them all [*The Incredibles* art](https://postimg.cc/SXyhktW1) and decor adorning the walls (Pixar always redecorates its buildings with art and [full-size statues](https://postimg.cc/1nX1Nn7p) from their next release). When it came time for the movie to start we shuffled into the theater, performed the “oohs” and “aahs” as the pre-show shooting stars appeared on the theater ceiling (a Pixar tradition), and then watched the movie. Spoiler alert: Ben’s daughter loved it, as did everyone else. There is just something magical about seeing a movie in the building where it was created and surrounded by the creators. 


After the credits finished rolling (never leave before the credits at these screenings), I walked with Ben to introduce him to a few of my coworkers. One of them was the late, great [Ralph Eggleston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Eggleston), a Pixar veteran who had joined the studio for *Toy Story* and touched everything after. When I had first met Ralph he was also working on the *not-yet-titled-little-chef* film, but soon he moved to a top-secret project which was coming out after that one. With the Pixar-Disney partnership ending after *Cars*, all work on later movies was kept under strict wraps, especially from Disney-affiliated people to avoid a Bug’s Life/Antz fiasco once Pixar broke free from Disney (note: Disney ended up not renewing the partnership with Pixar and instead flat-out bought them, many artists' tears were shed). The only thing I knew about Ralph’s project was it had something to do with space based on the cryptic images on his office door. Ralph and I had bonded earlier on *Ratatouille* as we had both grown up in the deep South in relatively small towns and were shocked that we ended up making major movies in CA, although his resume at that time was far, far more impressive than my single, unreleased movie. 


When I introduced Ralph to Ben, Ralph immediately recognized the name and geeked out over his *Star Wars* credentials. I shouldn’t have been surprised, Pixar, and animation/game studios in general, are full of *Star Wars* fans who know every bit of geeky minutia about the series and recognize obscure names who worked on the films (myself included, hence the origin of this story). As Ralph is geeking out, he tells Ben he is working on a project right up his alley. Ralph then waved someone over from across the room. That someone turned out to be [John Lasseter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lasseter), founding member and chief creative officer at Pixar. 


I don’t know John Lasseter. I had never truly met John Lasseter at that time. Technically he addressed me when he spoke to the audience at the ""Cast and Crew"" screening. And I once walked past him in a nearly empty hallway and he vaguely nodded at me in acknowledgment. Yet suddenly I was in a 4-way discussion with him about a project no one could really talk about due to Disney’s spies being everywhere. *Star Wars* geekiness was shared, comments that “we’ll be in touch” were floated, and soon Ben and I were on our own and I had no idea what had just happened. We met up with Ben’s family, listened to more excitement from his daughter about the movie, and eventually parted ways.


Over the following months Ben and I kept in touch, mostly through my grandmother and our walks. She proudly told all her neighbors that Ben had visited her grandson’s workplace, and that he’d had a wonderful time. A few months later, *Episode III* came out. It was a hit, the final lightsaber battle was incredible, and I made a point to stop by Ben’s house and congratulate him on his amazing work. We finally were able to talk about the fight scene which I “did not see what I thought I saw” months before.


I kept working at Pixar for a while, eventually moving off of *Ratatouille* and Pixar in general just before the Jan Pinkava/Brad Bird transition. I saw Ben less often, but my grandmother kept in touch with him during her walks. I learned through her that he was soon possibly going to work at Pixar and I was curious what he could be working on. The one time I asked he was cagey about it, doing another Jedi mind trick that it wasn’t what I thought it was.

 
Years later, I’m watching a futuristic film set in a post-human world filled with trash, cockroaches, and a single robot. Twenty minutes into the film, the title character, WALL-E, upon meeting the sleek EVE robot, mispronounces her name as “Ev-a” with a technical flare. And once again, Ben Burtt’s hard work was causing me to fall in love with these inanimate objects through their various beeps and other electronic noises. 


Sadly, my grandmother passed away a few years later, around the same time I completely left the animation industry. I fell out of touch with most of my Pixar and ILM contacts from that time. But when I think back on my grandmother I smile knowing about her unexpected contribution to the film industry. Now, I know the film industry is a relatively small, close-knit industry. If someone is making a robot film and they need someone to create voices for those robots then Ben Burtt is the top person on the list. He would have ended up on WALL-E no matter what. But I like to think that in this timeline, my grandmother’s penchant for talking to all her neighbors during her walks indirectly led to WALL-E and EVE getting their voices.

TLDR; OPs grandmother walks her neighborhood every day and is friends with her neighbor ""Ben"". During a shared walk, OP meets Ben and realizes he is Ben Burtt, sound designer for all Star Wars films. OP invites Ben to a Pixar screening of The Incredibles and they meet the people who are making WALL-E. Ben is hired by Pixar for WALL-E years later.",2025-04-07 19:58:25,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,71,6,,0.82,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jtuoqr/how_a_friendly_grandmothers_daily_walks/,chocobomog

1jva93u,reddit,What is your favorite random movie with an all-star cast?,There are plenty of big-time movies that has an awesome all-star cast like a lot of the films that were up for awards during awards season but there always seems to be a random film that has an all-star cast. With one of my favorites being Chef. Chef is a nice feel-good film about a father and son bonding over summer vacation as they travel across the U.S operating a food truck but it has 1 of the most loaded casts that I've ever seen with half the cast becoming Avengers and Jon Favreau becoming 1 of the big wigs at 1 of if not the most powerful media companies on Earth as well two of the biggest Hispanic actors in the U.S John Leguizamo and Sofia Vergara. The only person that wasn't a super star was the child actor player the son.

1jzl6c4,reddit,Reign Over Me,"This movie is so slept on. Sandler is raw in a way that’s almost uncomfortable, like you’re watching a real person spiral and heal in real time. It’s not showy grief, but it’s a sorta it’s muffled grief, which hits wayyyy harder IMO. The way he talks about his wife and kids, or more often doesn’t, is quietly devastating. Cheadle as well is phenomenal in this. He is always a perfect grounding force. In that scene in the courtroom where Sandler finally lets it out, feels like a cracked dam during a hurricane. Easily one of Sandler’s most emotionally truthful roles, it feels like he’s in the same headspace as like Uncut Gems but inverted. If that one is manic desperation then Reign Over Me is him suffering from a severe stillness in sorrow.

They show love, they are concerned about their daughter but not in a dramatic way. They ask if something is wrong and if they can help and when their daughter says no they drop the subject but still keep an eye on her. Also they show love to eachother.

Some Reviews:

[AV Club - Jacob Oller](https://www.avclub.com/until-dawn-review) \- D+

>Horror, whether in games or in movies, is about setups and payoffs. *Until Dawn* is a film almost exclusively of setups, with the payoffs either mismatched or permanently deferred. In its indecision around what kind of film it wanted to turn a decision-driven game into, firing its shotgun approach haphazardly into the air, it incoherently spins itself in circles.

[Inverse - Lyvie Scott](https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/until-dawn-review-horror-video-games)

>Throws plot out the window in favor of gore and schlock. \[Using\] a time-loop conceit to replicate the feeling of respawning in a video game, it gives director David F. Sandberg an excuse to blitz through as many teen horror tropes as can fit in two hours.

[Screen Rant](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/1647) \- [Mary Kassel](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/mary-kassel) \- 8/10

>Until Dawn takes the trope of the time loop & raises the stakes, immersing us in a thrilling & dynamic world of characters we can't stop rooting for. The movie is at its best when it's not taking itself too seriously. ***Until Dawn***\*\*'s weakest moments are when the action slows down and the writing attempts to psychoanalyze Clover\*\* and her issues. While it's necessary for her to have a fraught emotional backstory and for there to be hints of development, these transitions are far from seamless. Like all scary movies, *Until Dawn* sprinkles in commentary about the nature of grief and fear. However, it doesn't waste too much time trying to have a message, as it knows that isn't what the story is for.

[Slashfilm](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/1996) \- [Bill Bria](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/bill-bria) \- 8/10

>Although the film is deliberately not a repetition of the video game's plot, it absolutely adapts the game's implicit concept of asking the player whether they could actually survive a horror movie or not. ""Until Dawn"" the movie subtextually asks those questions of its viewers throughout, and with so many various beasties to encounter, the answers will vary for each person alone, never mind for multiple people. The movie's variety is the peanut butter to that idea's chocolate, never allowing the film to feel stuck in one mode even as it establishes its own structure. To borrow a phrase from Bobby, ""Until Dawn"" really does feel like the platonic ideal of a graveyard smash.

[FandomWire](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/100009878) \- [Manuel São Bento](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/manuel-sao-bento) \- B+

>Ella Rubin stands out in a cast that meets the bare minimum, and David F. Sandberg proves yet again that he's a filmmaker with vision, talent, and the creativity to craft visually captivating horror sequences.

[IGN Movies](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/811) \- [Chase Hutchinson](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/chase-hutchinson) \- 5/10

>Until Dawn shares a title and some key details with the game that inspired it, though it mostly tries to do its own thing – to mixed results. While Annabelle: Creation director David F. Sandberg is able to find moments of bloody fun and tension – particularly in the way he shoots darkness – the lackluster script he’s working with isn’t doing him or the movie any favors. It isn’t a total disaster, but as it pushed its one-dimensional characters through a cycle of horror cinema’s greatest hits, I wished that the morning could come as quickly as possible.

[The Daily Beast](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2345) \- [Nick Schager](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/nick-schager)

>Given that the game was co-penned by indie-horror icon Larry Fessenden (*Wendigo*), it’s somewhat baffling that *Until Dawn* ditches his story in favor of something this run-of-the-mill and half-baked. Despite an under-30 cast that’s perfectly capable of running and screaming when necessary (which is often), there’s no personality to this pandemonium, its evil beasts generic and its relive-the-night structure under-exploited.",2025-04-24 14:21:13,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,85,103,,0.82,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1k6tg5g/until_dawn_review_thread/,ChiefLeef22

1k2lzva,reddit,Zodiac (2007),"I just watched Zodiac (2007) for the first time, I knew about the case and the details of it before I watched the film, and I gotta say, David Fincher did a fantastic job making a movie based on the case. Because he didn’t try to make things grander than they were, or add a lot of bigger more epic things for dramatic purposes. He stayed completely true to real life even though the case in real life went nowhere. Telling the story through the eyes of Jake Gyllenhaal playing the real life cartoonist was the perfect way to tell the story for the film, because that’s where the letters were being sent, so we slowly learn the case at the same time as everyone else is learning about it reading the sent letters.

She's a phenomenal fighter, probably the best martial arts movie star the World has ever had. I love Michelle Yeoh but she is not a real fighter like Cynthia, she's more of a dancer in the same vein as Zhang Ziyi. That said, Cynthia Rothrock is a mediocre actress. 

And in Hollywood, she mostly did DTV movies. THe China O'Brien films, that one she did where she played a bodyguard to some rich dude which was so bad that it was a chore to watch it to the end.

I like Much Ado About Nothing well enough but I could probably recite it because there was a period in the 90s when it was ALWAYS ON the Disney channel. 

Don't Tell Mom The Babysitter's Dead happens to be a movie I love...but mostly because HBO wore it out. 

Toy Soldiers was in heavy, HEAVY rotation on TNT. It's another one I weirdly cherish not because I loved it, necessarily, but because it was just a constant background sound to certain times in my life.

Nina, a young, tempestuous woman, finds herself stranded in the far North. She convinces five men on a bachelor hunting trip, to put her up for a few days. In this masculine microsociety, by turns hilarious and philosophical, Nina starts to feel a sense of belonging she never has before. But a mysterious stranger’s arrival changes the course of this improvised holiday forever. Both raw and dreamlike, Hunting Daze offers up a unique universe where humour, horror, the uncanny, and the sensual combine.

Our film played at SXSW, Fantasia, Sydney FF, KVFF, and more in 2024. It's out now in the US and Canada on Digital.

1k4ufeo,reddit,Just bought a Possessor poster. Brandon Cronenberg is doing his father proud—this might be one of the smartest shockers I’ve seen.,"I think \*Possessor\* (2020) is an absolute beast of a film. Grotesque, potent, and genuinely intelligent — not just another slick horror concept, but a brutal, evocative exploration of identity, corporate ethics, and psychological fragmentation. The idea of possession-as-a-service for assassination, with plausible deniability baked into its very mechanics (“no one would believe it anyway”), is such a strong sci-fi premise. But what really blew me away is how \*\*expertly it’s implemented\*\*.

The creative violence feels like early Rodriguez if he had a Cronenberg soul. Every shock is earned, not just stylized — and that final stretch? Devastating. Cronenberg Jr. Doesn’t just live up to his dad’s legacy — he’s mutating it into something uniquely his own.

I loved it so much I bought a poster. Next on my haul is \*Possession\* (1981), which I’ve heard is equally deranged but in a totally different register.

Anyone else vibe with \*Possessor\* this hard? Or have other twisted, intelligent horror recs in the same lane?",2025-04-22 01:30:33,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,56,17,,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1k4ufeo/just_bought_a_possessor_poster_brandon_cronenberg/,N/A

The practical effects in this movie blew my mind. I mean that genuinely and scinerely. I kept doubting the movie to manage and depict the powers of the Kryptonians at every turn, and I was constantly proven wrong. This movie makes you believe that a man can tear down a building with his hands.


I can praise this movie up and down, the Kryptonian trio are a great addition to this movie over the first one. Zod and Ursa are so captivating. And may I add, Sarah Douglas as Ursa is hot as *fuck*.


God how did they manage to capture so much charm and imagination decades before the comic book movie was even a thing.

It takes the concept of Groundhog Day, gives us a protagonist that is a totally unlikable bitch at first but ofc goes through a big ass character development as the same day is on a repeating loop, everything is very investing, including the building romance between Tree and Carter and how things are switched up in with that in the sequel, and still making that interesting.

The sequel thankfully while.....repeating the first movie in a lot of ways, also does a lot of things very differently, and I'm totally invested in all the different things that take place, keeps things fresh when sequels actually do that. Also......DAMN did the second movie double down on drama and emotional moments!

1joy4oi,reddit,"Calling Out Criterion, Arrow, Shout Factory, and Other Boutique Studios Regarding Subtitles or Lack Thereof on Physical Media","I have an extensive collection of movies that I enjoy, including DVDs, Blu-Rays, and 4Ks. I always check to see if they have subtitles, as there are still some movies out there that are still released without them. Because I'm Deaf, I have to have subtitles on at all times, and I understand that even hearing people are having it on too, as not to miss anything. As more movies are being added to the physical formats, a few glaring issues are starting to arise.


**Special Features**

As most of you will know, a lot of these movies come with special features and commentaries from people who worked on the movies. These are great additions to the movies or shows that would make any fan happy to watch; however, releases from boutique studios, such as Criterion, Arrow, Shout, and many others have chosen not to subtitle any of the large swath of special features. Imagine my disappointment when I buy ""The Lighthouse"" from Arrow, and I am extremely curious about the behind-the-scenes of it, only for none of it to be subtitled. Same for my recent purchases of ""No Country for Old Men"" *(Criterion)*, ""Paris, Texas"" *(Criterion)*, ""Trick r Treat"" *(Arrow)*, ""RoboCop 2"" *(Shout Factory)*, and so many more titles in my library. I haven't checked ""Seven Samurai"" from BFI yet out of fear of disappointment that it too will be lacking subtitles. I am willing to bet that 90% of these boutique studios' releases have not subtitled any of them. I have tried not to let it bother me as I am appreciative of owning my favorite movies, but I can't help but grow increasingly frustrated with the lack of implementation of subtitles on special features, especially if they are used as major selling points on the back of the box or in release announcements. Especially considering it may be baked into the price of the movies.

**Foreign Films**

Criterion's most recent release of ""Godzilla vs Biollante"" is what urged me to finally speak up about this problem. I was excited to finally watch this movie, only for the first few lines of the movie, which were spoken in English, to be translated into Japanese. I was immediately disappointed as a few minutes later into the movie, another conversation is being had, and it is being translated into Japanese rather than English. I turned it off and put it away. I have thought of returning it and getting my money back, but in the end I decided to keep it. I looked around in the hopes of getting in contact with someone at Criterion. There was an email address for a person, so I decided to get in touch with him. Unfortunately, I've had no response. Many foreign film releases have fallen into this trap of not translating any English spoken dialogue, and there were no options to resolve that. Netflix, Criterion, and others have repeatedly done so, leaving me confused about what is happening plot-wise.

**Unnecessary Censorship**

Going back to Criterion, I recently watched ""Ed Wood"" on their streaming service, and my wife noticed something odd with their subtitles. With ""Ed Wood"" the subtitles were completely replacing curse words with more family friendly versions. This is one of the more common problems with many streaming services where they will often replace or censor curse words as if all of us deaf people are extremely sensitive to harsh language. I understand that most of these services or releases may have accidentally added the TV versions of the subtitles, and it can happen.

**Conclusion**

With the ever growing library of physical media and more movies being released through boutique studios becoming a far more major player in this, I understand that they may not have the budget, time, or access to provide subtitles. Sometimes, they just don't think about including such accessibility for them. It has grown increasingly difficult to reach out to these studios and have a direct conversation about what can be done in the future, where I don't feel like I'm wasting my money and dissuade me from future purchases.",2025-04-01 15:16:49,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,48,25,,0.71,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1joy4oi/calling_out_criterion_arrow_shout_factory_and/,A_Zombie1223

1k5ljc8,reddit,We need to talk about kevin,"So…I finally decided to watch We Need to Talk About Kevin. After finishing the movie, I came straight here to see what people had to say about the ending and the film overall. One question that keeps coming up is: Why didn’t Kevin kill his mother?

A lot of people interpret it as Kevin wanting to punish her or provoke a reaction—and while I agree with that interpretation to some extent, I have a different take I’d like to share.

I think Kevin didn’t kill his mother because doing so would’ve given his actions a clear motive. Let me explain.

There’s a scene where his mother asks him why he collects those “crash CDs,” and he replies: “There is no point. That’s the point.” That line really stuck with me. It shows that Kevin is fascinated by meaningless things—things that have no purpose.

Which brings me to my theory: he killed his father, sister, and classmates because there was no reason to. His father was kind to him, his sister was just a child, and the classmates didn’t really do anything to him. There was no personal vendetta. And in Kevin’s twisted worldview at the time, that lack of meaning made it worth doing.

But killing his mother? That would have made sense. That would have had a clear motive:revenge, hatred, resentment. And that’s exactly why he didn’t do it.

At the end of the movie, when she asks him “Why?”, he says, “I used to think I knew. Now I’m not so sure.” To me, that shows he’s grown out of that phase of finding meaning in meaninglessness, and now he’s left with confusion and regret, or at least uncertainty.

1juw2vi,reddit,Withnail and I (1987),"I saw Withnail and I just the other night and have since watched it on repeat as its so British, so funny, charming, poetic and yet a Tragic tale of friendship

i didn't realise immediately that it's set in the 60s

2 struggling actors who spend what little they've got on booze and occasionally drugs in their squalid home get the opportunity to spend the weekend with Withnail's uncle Monty out in the country

And it just gets funnier and occasionally awkward

Richard E Grant is fantastic in his film debut and totally committed to the role (he genuinely looks terribly ill) in almost every scene

Withnail is a coward while ""I"" really struggles with anxiety and outside the acting circle they'r both pretty much hopeless in life

But it's a tragic tale as Withnail isn't the one to get his big break as a leading man in some big production it's ""I"" instead

So Withnail is left reciting poetry to zoo animals in the pouring rain while his friend starts his big adventure in the acting world ...I liked the movie so much but the unexpected ending almost had me filling up with sorrow

Freaky

Keeping Mum

Going in Style

Some Like it Hot

My Favorite Brunette

Road to Bali

Kung Fu Panda

Groundhog Day

8 Heads in a Duffle Bag

Elf (although that's more of a Christmas movie)

Blackbeards Ghost

Weekend at Bernie's 

The Invention of Lying

The Man Who Knew Too Little

Ready or Not

The Frighteners

Renfield

Galaxy Quest

IT crowd (series)

Supernatural (comedy episodes such as Mystery Spot and Bad Day At Blackrock)

Frasier (such as The High Holidays)

Paul

The Last Supper (1995)

The Brand New Testament

Up in Smoke

The Pink Panther (2006)

Vamps

Walk of Shame

Dharma and Greg

The Simpsons (in general)

Buffy The Vampire Slayer (movie but also the series has some funny episodes)

Death Becomes Her

My Favorite Martian

Plains Trains and Automobiles

Yes man

Ghost town

Even almighty

Tucker and Dale VS Evil

What We Do In The Shadows (TV series, the movie was ok)

Clue

I DONT like comedy's that rely on a lot of shock, nudity or gross out humour such as as Movie 54.

I'm not a fan of comedy movies that have a focus on relationships BUT if there is a big element of humor such as Even Almighty I'm cool with it.

I also like dark comedy but again it has to have a lot of humor such as Groundhog day.

I'm good with comedy movies that have a lot of gore in such as Tucker and Dale vs Evil, Ready or Not and Freaky.

I'm good with slapstick humor such as Pink Panther 2006, Death Becomes Her and Plains Trains and Automobiles.

Please help me find more comedy movies (and no spoilers please!), if you have any questions I'd be happy to answer.

Edit: I also liked
Hot Fuzz but not Shaun of The Dead or Worlds End

Monty Python and The Holy Grail

Stan VS Evil

1jwlqr5,reddit,Jason Statham cinematic universe.,"
I am fully on board with the idea of a Jason Statham cinematic universe. 

I want a team up of Jason Statham Nutty Professor style playing his characters from what I call “Statham’s Professionals films”. The movies where he plays different professions. 

So we have:

- The Beekeeper 

- A Working Man

- The Transporter

- The Mechanic

And whatever he has lined up next. 

Maybe they’re all gathered together as a teams by Statham’s character from Spy.

1jxq7al,reddit,"After Grave of the Fireflies, I watched When the Wind Blows....and it scared me in a different way","It carries a similar theme, set around the Cold War era. This one focuses on the lives of an elderly British couple trying their best to survive during wartime by strictly following government-issued instructions. They manage to survive the initial bombing, but what follows is even more tragic , as radiation sickness sets in and food becomes scarce, they slowly grow weaker and weaker.

What hit me the most was how they still held on to hope, believing the government would come to help...even in their final moments. That part was heartbreaking.

The animation is quite simple overall, but there are scenes...especially the one where the bomb hits , that were absolutely terrifying and brilliantly done. The destruction of the city, the trains, bridges, and homes...it felt like watching a storm rip through everything. I’m not exaggerating, that whole sequence genuinely scared me. It was intense.

I also liked how the husband remained optimistic through it all. He tried to keep things together, clinging to hope, comforting his wife, and trusting the system till the very end.

To me, this movie is about how ordinary people place blind trust in their government ,doing everything they're told ...while those in power make some decisions that leave civilians to suffer the consequences.

I won’t say it hit me as hard as Grave of the Fireflies, maybe because of the animation style or tone, but the quiet sadness in this movie... it lingers. It really does. Watching an old couple slowly fade away, still praying and holding on to faith ...that broke me all over again.

I absolutely loved the movie, especially the character of FL and Brad Pitt. Both represent the industry way too well, especially the downward spiral. The ending was super well, to me it was super relatable. The desire to be great-to be just be so great that people will remember you even after 100 years. 

  
The ending to me was such- Neille and Manny wanted to be part of something great, something bigger than human life. This was their connection. For Manny, the dream ended because he chose to get away from the screen, or to put it better, found satisfaction off-screen. Manny, on the other hand, found herself in the spotlight. Her character was obsessed with attention. She, too, wanted greatness. When watching the film, Manny realized that while Neille might have died at 32, but was still alive in people's memories, so was Jack (Brad Pitt) He remember his words-maybe felt regret but this filmns throws light on many things- To move on, Cycle of life, and also the price of greatness.",2025-04-07 22:17:34,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,39,24,,0.74,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jtxz8d/just_finished_babylon_and_i_loved_it/,darkexplorer666
1jsz77i,reddit,What are your thoughts on George C. Scott?,"Question, What are your thoughts on George C. Scott?

I've been on a binge of watching George C. Scott movies & show and I must say, George C. Scott really is a great actor. He has such a commanding presence when he is on screen, but he also manages to give such a vulnerable side to what character he plays. To me his best roles are Dr. Strangelove & Patton. Dr. Strangelove, for the sheer fact that he (& Also Slim Pickens) managed to outplay Peter Sellers and Patton, which is just a great performance and I consider it the best role he has ever played. He also deliver great performances in Anatomy Of A Muder, The Hustler, The Bible, The Hospital, Hardcore, The Changeling, A Christmas Carol.

I will say though, while George C. Scott is a great actor, some of the films he is in are probably not so great, which is why I think his film career stalled after the 70s, with films like The Last Run, Rage, The Day Of The Dolphin, Bank Shot, The Savage Is Loose, Island In The Streams, & The Formula being very mid, but saved by Scott. I also read that Scott turned down lead roles in In The Heat Of The Night, McCabe & Mrs. Miller, The Cowboys, The Godfather, Deliverance, Network, The Shootist.

However, what impresses me with Scott is that he managed to juggle both his film career and television career, which was a little frowned upon when trying to make a successful film career.

But all in all, What are your thoughts on George C. Scott?",2025-04-06 17:17:30,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,35,88,,0.74,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jsz77i/what_are_your_thoughts_on_george_c_scott/,FreshmenMan

1k5wmdo,reddit,Famke Janssen's Xenia Onatopp was the most memorable Bond Girl in the Pierce Brosnan Bond Era,"Sure, some fans like Michelle Yeoh's Wai Lin from Tomorrow Never Dies. I liked her as well, even though I did feel her character is barely onscreen for the first hour. I liked Isabella Scorupo's resourceful Natalya. Rosamund Pike was okay as Miranda Frost. I found Halle Berry overrated as Jinx. 

Out of all the Bond Girls, the one who stood out the most for me was Famke Janssen as Xenia Onatopp. I've never seen a female villain be that bad in film and enjoy every moment of it. Her ice cold demeanour, the devilish smile as she kills. You can tell she gets a sick pleasure from breaking her victim's waists. 

The Sauna scene she has with Bond is a mix of violence and sexual tension. Bond is terrified of her but also, he finds himself drawn by her. I loved that.

All that being said, the score of the sharks theme is also spine tingling and eerie, and it could have gone on to have a good sequel if they would have kept the graphics and effects what they were (we won't discuss DBS2 here) Honestly it had its flaws, what movie doesn't, but I'm genuinely curious, Deep Blue Sea, bad movie?

Only saw them when they were on TV earlier but I didn't hold them in very high regard maybe because I was younger. I was blown away how good these films are now.

The pacing is breakneck which I feel is lacking in movies these days. How good was Daniel Craig in his pre-Bond role!

The sequel is even better and Roger Ebert was a fan of it while most critics disliked it then. It doubles the action, the locations and Angelina kicks even more ass. The look is stylized and it works. Some scenes feel straight from the games.

1jkty5x,reddit,The birds [1963]. I have seen this movie more than I've seen my own father.,"This movie is perfect, to me. 

The movie aged well. I love how the actual plot of the birds is very much happening in the background for half of the movie until it is thrust in the forefront. The movie allows you to get to know Melanie, so you understand and care about her. I know some people say the first half drags, but I love how it is its own fun romantic movie before the tragedy sets in. The plot is scary, and I appreciate the feeling of doom. And I like how all the relationships between all the characters have depth. 

The dinner scene where they are debating if birds can attack is perfect. The way everyone reacts and plays off everyone else is amazing. I love the contrast of the hysterical mother with the overly logical bird expert. 

To be honest I have a huge crush on both leads. Melanie is a strong, wild, and clever woman. Mitch is clever, strong, and a gentleman. Both are insanely attractive. They have serious chemistry and the way they match each other in wit is awesome. It is extremely charming. 

Overall, 10/10. I watch it every time I get sick, and it always feels like a privilege. I have seen this movie 50+ times. ",2025-03-27 02:41:30,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,31,12,,0.77,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jkty5x/the_birds_1963_i_have_seen_this_movie_more_than/,ThrowRA-Hanshotfirst

1k5egiq,reddit,I Saw the TV Glow and We’re all going to the Worlds Fair capture loneliness in a way I’ve never seen before.,"SPOILERS for We’re all going to the Worlds Fair and I saw the TV Glow

I know their movies are not for everyone but I just finished watching We’re all going to the Worlds Fair and I saw the TV Glow and was blown away.

 I grew up having no close friends, being homeschooled for a big chunk of my childhood and having basically no parental supervision so I watched a lot of movies, TV shows and anime and I would become totally engrossed in whatever I was watching at that moment, if I was watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Dragon Ball Z or Inuyasha it was all I talked about, and all I thought about and I would go to sleep thinking about those shows. The characters in the shows actually felt like my friends and the fantasy world became more real than real life. 


When I saw I saw the TV Glow I’ve never connected with a movie on that level before. The main character becomes obsessed with a TV show and he has a very surface level relationship with his only friend where all they have on common is their obsession for that TV Show.  Just like the main character, later in the movie, I’ve also revisited old cartoons and shows that used to mean so much to me and was surprised how much they just looked like crappy kids shows.

One thing I liked about We’re all Going to the World Fair is unlike a lot of movies that portray depression this was just about a normal kid. I really hate the “depressed teenager who is an incredible artist or musician” archetype. I thought it was refreshing to see a movie about a normal sad person.


I can’t speak to the “trans” aspects of the films but I can relate to being isolated and uncomfortable in your own skin.

1jk3qie,reddit,Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle (2018) - I can't believe how good this movie is and also how poorly it was received,"Ok I know I'm 7 years late, but I finally just watched Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle. I was absolutely blown away by the visuals as well as the acting by the main character Rohan Chand (at just 14 years old).  I was shocked to find out it was made in 2018, I feel like the visuals are above and beyond much of what I see from movies made today in 2025. And while the main character is a very young actor, he stays in character amazingly well and his facial expressions and delivery of his (sparing) lines is a above and beyond what I'd ever normally expect from an actor that age. 

Of course there was massive departure from the ""original"" story, but that didn't bother me at all, it's its own story and adaptation and I felt they pulled it off masterfully. 

The only thing I can assume from reading the prevalence of bad reviews is that people are pissed that it didn't do justice to their nostalgia for the ""original(s)"". 

The few reviewers who mentioned uncanny valley also baffle me.  I'm as adverse as the next guy to poorly animated humans and other creatures who speak, but I felt none of that in Mowgli. The animals with speech were remarkably believable and relatable. 

I searched and read threads on reddit from just after it came out, and most seemed to share the same criticisms as the critics, but I'm curious if that is still the consensus?

Brendan Frazer does an amazing acting job as always, as does Elizabeth Hurley as the Devil, not to mention that she was drop-dead gorgeous! This is a remake of a movie from 1967 with the same title, starring Dudley Moore and Peter Cook, who played the Devil in that one. The original is also quite good, but I'd say not as good as the remake, though they're pretty much the same story, i.e., a pathetic nobody gets offered seven wishes from the Devil in exchange for their soul, but the Devil makes all their wishes go bad, though at the end, everything works out for both innocent characters (no spoilers here!) to the detriment of the Devil, who needs to look for another soul.

One thing I prefer about the remake, besides the Devil being played by a very hot woman, is that I thought it was quite thought-provoking concerning good, evil, and what really matters in life. Although I'm not religious and I don't believe in the Devil, at least not literally, I do believe in good and evil and I think we all face a battle between them, and ultimately we all need to decide which path to take and what really matters in our lives, which is what I think both movies are trying to say, but I think the 2000 remake says it better.",2025-04-16 05:51:26,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,28,30,,0.76,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1k0d8w3/bedazzled_2000/,dcterr

Is it a bad movie? It depends on your perspective. I like it as a guilty pleasure movie. It’s flawed and nearly drowns under Costner’s ego, but it is entertaining.

If you like Mad Max or the Road Warrior type of action movies, you will enjoy this. Waterworld is basically the same thing, but on water.

Motorcycles are replaced with jet skis and boats.

This movie also features Dennis Hopper as the main bad guy and leader of the “Smokers”

Kevin Costner almost died during production via an accident while filming a scene in open water.

All these films I’ve never seen but have always heard about and seen referenced but I never knew how much I was missing out. The 90s had so many amazing and influential movies it’s not even funny. My favorite is hard to pick but it either has to be The crow or silence of the lambs that are my favorites. I’ve seen those two, se7en, fight club, the usual suspects, the sixth sense, blade runner, pulp fiction and I can go on but the rest are 2000s or later movies like Warrior or Blade runner 2049 and inglorious basterds. 

Some films even when you know the twist can’t take away from just how great they are. Some films I definitely enjoyed more than others but when people say some of these films are the best or just the best in their genre I can see why. I think as someone who likes any genre other than romance no offense to the romance lovers of course I’ve never been more satisfied in the films I’ve watched. Maybe I’m blowing it out of proportion but I just wanted to make like a 90s movie appreciation post and can’t imagine what it was like seeing these twists in theaters like the usual suspects.

 It just keeps popping up in my thoughts. What the father went through, how the mother and child died, that highway scene... everything was so uncomfortable to watch. I keep imaging how it will feel to loose the people I love the most in such a cruel way. I keep imagining how the father felt, as he watched his family taken, how the mother and daughter felt, knowing they are going to die... 

And the scene were they find their bodies, just slumped together, naked and raped on some moth-eaten couch in a junk yard. Their lifeless eyes... it was horrible.

But upon watching, I must say I was very impressed by this movie. It was very much a throwback to 90's action flicks. The plot was predictable, the action was over the top, and the one-liners were corny. It just worked so well.

The only thing that makes this movie work is the casting for the lead protagonist and antagonist. Viola Davis, and Anthony Davis are not winning Oscars for this movie, but their character portrayals were top notch. The scene were Viola Davis' character describes her time time in the military was gripping and emotional. I wasn't prepared for that in a shoot 'em up flick. And the scene shared with Viola Davis and Anthony Starr discussing the villain's motivation was incredible. Great chemistry between them. 

Bonus shout out to Ramon Rodriguez. His portrayal of a badass secret service agent was superb. He was the perfect foil for the President. 

Overall this was a good popcorn flick. I recommend it for some 90's style action. The obvious comparisons are Die Hard, and Air Force One, so that's great company to be in.

But what movie made you cry when it wasn't really supposed to? 

For me, this movie was Bill and Ted Face the Music. Seems like the least likely movie in the world to make you cry, right? Well, I watched it with my wife for the first time the other night. For some bizarre reason, we merged our Final Destination marathon with our Bill and Ted marathon; we'd watch a couple Final Destinations, then a Bill and Ted per night over a few nights. The contrast was surreal; Death goes from killing people with Rube Goldberg level complexity in Final Destination, to chilling and playing bass in Bill and Ted. None of those movies were particularly sad in any way, I just laughed as people were splattered in Final Destination and as Bill and Ted rocked out. 

Then Face the Music hit me in the feels in two ways. First, it didn't feel the same without Rufus; George Carlin is one of my favorite comedians, one that my dad introduced me to(after I'd already grown up listening to Carlin narrate Thomas the Tank Engine. I was shocked by his comedy at first to say the least.) It was nice to see the hologram, but it made me miss ol' George that much more. The second was the ending, when Bill and Ted realize it's their daughters that write the song that unites the world (and realty), not them, and they kind of pass the torch to them and offer their support. And I just lost it.

 My dad committed suicide this past December, and it's still a really sore spot for me. He was the one who showed me the first two Bill and Ted movies as a kid, and introduced me to heavy metal and horror movies. When I came out to him as transgender, he embraced me as his 'favorite(and only)' daughter and didn't judge in the slightest, even if it was a little bit of an adjustment. I introduced him to my girlfriend, now my wife,  and he was happy for us and thought we were cute together.  I know I'm carrying on the torch for him in a lot of ways. To see Bill and Ted be so chill with their daughters(who are the very least throwing off queer vibes), and be proud of what they accomplish,  just resonated with me because that is almost the exact kind of chill relationship we had. I was a mess. I'll never get the chance to watch it with him and talk to him about it.

1ju39lg,reddit,Stand by me(1986),"

So I just watched stand by me and it was an amazing ride. I think my favorite character throughout the entire film had to be Chris. I feel like each character brought their own little charm to the group but Chris really stuck out but in the best way. Seeing him support Gordie and the speech he gave him about his writing and how he believes in him was amazing but it was also sad hearing him talk so badly about his self later on and even a teacher using him as leverage all cause she knew they wouldn’t believe him.

 Thing is I want to say each grew but I’m not sure Vern and teddy did but that’s not knocking them since I enjoyed them but by the end they seemed to have grown slightly but I’m sure that’s do in fact to seeing a dead body. Gordie having to come to terms with his brothers death and even speaking to the dead boy like he was his brother was really heartbreaking. Everybody was always comparing him to his brother and the only people who ever seemed like knew the real him was his friends or the only ones who wanted to see the real him.

I could go on but I feel like I’d have too much to say but each character seems to have their own trauma or struggles they have to get through and by the end it feels like they go from boys to men. It feels like based on the stares and somber attitude they realize this isn’t a joke, someone lost their life and it’s fleeting and should be taken seriously, a childish adventure turned into a road into adult hood. Sorry if I sound like an idiot and reading into what happened wrong but it’s either trauma or growing up and I hope it’s the latter. Even the ending caught me off guard but it feels real to me, how life is fleeting and it can be taken away at any given moment no matter how good your intentions or you as a person may be. 
 
 Also side note and I know their kids so it’s odd to ask but did anybody else get the vibe that Chris or Gordie may have had feelings for each other, some scenes with them just felt oddly close like more than best friends?

Sometimes i see a title of which I know it's a good one but never seen (tonight it will be Blade Runner, 1982) or a movie from my childhood long forgotten. 

When I started buying dvd's I used to google titles, using IMDB to see if the rates were high enough. But I have stopped doing this because picking movies based on their covers and small descriptions is so much more fun and simply closer to myself. There are plenty of movies who have a 3/10 rating which, for me.. are solid 8/10... and vise versa.

Picking movies like this also works differenly without endless scrolling. It forces some commitment: even if the movie is bad. But now by watching so many bad movies, the enjoyment and understanding of good scenes only grew stronger. 

Something started to spark inside me, a will. The will to create my own story: a comic. 

I felt like sharing this because it is so much fun and so much greater than Netflix or such

Betty White as a foul-mouth old farm lady, Oliver Platt as a smarmy yet charmy billionaire, and Brendan Gleeson as the dry-witted sheriff absolutely sparkle as the supporting cast, around the fairly boring Bridget Fonda + Bill Pullman leads.

Could you imagine Tarantino’s script and dialogue in the hands of DDL? Everybody brings their A-game when showing up to a Tarantino set, established actors or not. Day-Lewis is the game.

I once read somewhere that Day-Lewis spent roughly a year preparing for his role in “Lincoln.” The product of course, was mesmerizing. It’s one thing to bring a fictional character to life. It’s quite another thing when somebody can bring back an iconic figure in history back from the dead, so convincingly that it felt as Day-Lewis simply held a seance and channeled the President himself. 

Tarantino needs no argument here. 

Honestly neither does Day-Lewis for that matter. 

I believe the level of craftsmanship of both Tarantino and Day-Lewis coming together would be a force to be reckoned with and a cinematic feat of achievement that would be unparalleled.

Except the exceptional direction, execution and cast, What makes it remarkable is that is not just ""another great war movie"" where you at some point, directly or indirectly will be fed with morals, and the movie will make sure that by the end of it, you will know the good guys from the bad ones. I don´t say it is necessarily a bad thing but I think it is much more difficult to make a ww2 movie that will not in the slightest give a hint of the moral shortcomings of the germans (or the japanese).

This is I think the core to what makes Das Boot a unicorn. It balances a really touchy subject so masterfully that no one can blame it for being either too political and pretentious, but it´s not lame and totally avoiding on the other side either. It just feels very real and honest.

Then during the movie there’s this fake newspaper headline that says “Pope Condemns Bio-Dome.” We laughed at how random and over the top it was.

But then I remembered… the actual Pope just died yesterday. And not just any pope...Pope Francis, who was known for being a major advocate for the environment. He literally wrote an encyclical on climate change. So the Earth Day connection felt extra surreal.

And to make it even weirder, there’s a throwaway line in the movie about red food dye, and sure enough, earlier today there was an actual press conference about banning certain petroleum-based food dyes like Red 3 and Red 40.

The movie takes place in a desert type environment, maybe Arizona, New Mexico or Texas. A drug deal goes down in the middle of nowhere and a shootout occurs. Both parties shoot each other and all appear to be dead. When the cops arrive the cops find the money and the drugs and decide to keep it for themselves. 

Later they are contacted by a crime scene technician who informs them that one of the dead parties was an undercover narcotics agent, and their discussions to keep the drugs and the money were recorded because the dead cop was wearing a wire. The crime scene tech demands a cut or he will turn them in.",2025-03-27 14:08:22,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,15,65,,0.59,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jl4qp4/name_the_movie_drug_deal_gone_wrong/,jgr615

1k0eibh,reddit,"I can’t stop thinking about They Shoot Horses, Don’t They ?","I came across it on youtube and have always been intrigued by it. I was sleepy but I started it just to watch a little of it, and I couldn’t stop. This movie fucked me up. 

The level of desperation and hopelessness in this is powerful as hell. Every actor in the cast is outstanding , but Jane Fonda gives possible a career best performance (and it’s one of her earlier ones), Susannah York is haunting and flawlessly portrays a woman who’s psyche is slowly being destroyed, and Gig Young rightfully won an Oscar for his performance. What happened to him later in his life (murder/suicide) just adds another layer of dread. 

Sydney Pollocks direction is phenomenal.  The editing, the pacing, the palpable hell of the scenario is genuinely unsettling and unsparing. It feels like a waking nightmare. The fact it is based on the real dance marathons during the depression is just so devastating. Humanity at its worst and most frail. 

The ending lands at least five big gut punches and left me so overwhelmed, but I loved every moment of it. This has instantly found its way into my favorite films of all time, but it will probably be a while before another viewing. It’s impossible to forget , though. 

Finally, the greatest punch in the face is how timely and relevant it remains , despite being a film from the 60s, about the great depression a few decades earlier. I kept thinking of all of those Mr. Beast competitions, it’s sickening. 

I’ll leave it at that for now, but definitely check it out if you haven’t. But if you’re in a bad frame of mind maybe wait until you’re in a better mood. It’s an uncommonly harrowing experience, and it doesn’t pull any punches.

1jud61p,reddit,House of Gucci (2021),"House of Gucci isn’t exactly a _good_ movie, nor is it a terrible one, but it’s a pretty good Terrible Movie (capitalization required here). That quality is due almost entirely to Lady Gaga’s performance as Patrizia Reggiani & the strength of the script: “Patrizia is correctly pegged by the Gucci patriarch as a tasteless hobag gold-digger…and is also the only other competent Gucci” is a very strong irony/punchline.

The film as a whole is a solid-enough farce all things considered; the one real problem is that director Ridley Scott seems to be the only person involved not to realize it – and this reflects itself in the poor cast control. Gaga is great & Salma Hayek is game as TV psychic/gal Pina, but Jeremy Irons’ Rodolfo Gucci (the aforementioned patriarch) is the only other person who’s even kinda trying. Adam Driver is uncharacteristically weak as deuteragonist Maurizio Gucci, a mix between sleepwalking and obvious embarrassment at the rest of the film. Al Pacino & Jared Leto are both well into the Self-Parody zone (Leto’s Paolo being literally just Carl from _Aqua Teen Hunger Force_) – Scott tries to frame some of their interactions as dramatic, but these don’t land because of how ridiculous their characters are. The effect is that this isn’t deadpan so much as “cast rebellion against the director” – that clash between Scott’s serious take & the script’s “Patrizia’s the only competent Gucci” means that the ending (>!Maurizio’s assassination at Patrizia’s hand!<) leaves a sort of ashen taste in the mouth. 

Basically: Ridley Scott taking this seriously hamstrings rather than elevates the comedic potential – a director more in on the joke could’ve taken this to the heights of black farce. But as it is, it’s a fairly amusing movie that’s really fun if you’re watching it high.",2025-04-08 13:09:38,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,18,22,,0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jud61p/house_of_gucci_2021/,deeppurple1729

1jqaxbc,reddit,The Boys from Brazil,"Who here has seen this movie? I've watched it about 5 times, and I never get tired of it. I think it's an excellent and thought-provoking film with a big warning regarding some potential dangers of cloning and genetic engineering. When the movie came out in 1978, as far as we know, no living thing had yet been cloned, although the necessary science and technology was nearly in place, as the movie also dramatically shows. In 1996, Dolly the sheep became the first cloned mammal, and supposedly a few years ago, a couple of kids were cloned or at least genetically engineered in China, though this isn't definitely known. In any case, I'd say the technology already exists for human cloning and genetic engineering, so what should we do about it, and how do we avoid a madman like Dr. Mengele, who in The Boys from Brazil was able to clone 94 copies of Adolf Hitler?

Besides the obvious ethical concerns this movie presents, I'd say the story and acting were quite excellent, especially Gregory Peck, who played the horribly evil and frightening Doctor of Death, Dr. Mengele, as well as Lawrence Olivier, who did an excellent job as Lieberman, an old Jewish spy who uncovers Dr. Mengele's evil plot and is able to stop him before he has a chance to create the Fourth Reich!",2025-04-03 06:06:35,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,17,18,,0.79,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jqaxbc/the_boys_from_brazil/,dcterr

1k3f34m,reddit,Jenny Curran’s Version of Forrest Gump,"Jenny Curran’s Version of Forrest Gump

I was born in Greenbow, Alabama, in a house full of ghosts and a man who didn’t know how to love anything but his fists and the bottle. My mother died young, and my sisters left. I stayed. I shouldn’t have. He took everything from me.

When I was a little girl, I’d climb high in the trees and pray to be a bird so I could fly far, far away. That prayer became a curse. I ran. For most of my life, I ran from pain, from people, from myself. I didn’t know who I was without the fear. I still don’t.

Then there was Forrest.

He was the only thing in my life that didn’t hurt. He didn’t ask questions. He didn’t judge. He didn’t even understand what had happened to me. And somehow, that made it easier. He saw something good in me I never saw in myself. But loving Forrest? That felt impossible. I wasn’t built for love. I was built for running.

I tried to escape the world in all the ways broken people do. Music. Protests. Drugs. Empty faces in dark rooms. I thought I was chasing freedom, but I was just spinning in circles, digging a deeper hole. I watched people die. Friends. Lovers. Parts of me. And I kept running.

When I saw Forrest again, he hadn't changed. Still staring at me with those wide eyes like I was made of gold. I slept with him because... I wanted to feel something pure. For a moment, I did. But I left. Because Forrest was clean, and I was dirt. He was a dream, and I was still stuck in a nightmare.

I found out I was pregnant a few months later. And for once, I didn’t run. I kept the baby. Our baby. But I never told Forrest. Not because I didn’t want him involved—but because I didn’t want to ruin him. He deserved peace. He didn’t need my wreckage dragging him under.

Years passed. I got sick. Something the doctors didn’t understand—mysterious, incurable, slow. When I felt the end creeping up on me, I did what I swore I’d never do. I called Forrest. Not because I wanted help. But because our son deserved to know the one good man I ever knew.

Forrest married me. He took care of me. He looked at me like nothing had changed. Like I wasn’t wasting away. Like I hadn’t burned every bridge I’d ever built. He forgave me before I even asked.

And when I died… I think that was the first time I ever felt truly safe.

written and directed by ashraf shishir, the film tells the story of a man living in the 1970s in post liberation war bangladesh. after being overcome with guilt about killing an ant, he meet an aspiring filmmaker who insist that life is just one big movie with god as the director. the filmmaker wants to make a movie and tells the man that he should be the hero of the film if he wants to repent for his sins. cue shenanigans.

the film's runtime is a whopping 21 hours. that's right. this movie about a guy feeling bad that he killed an ant is going to take you a vast majority of the day to watch. the film was shot over the course of 9 years beginning in 2009 and had no less then 4,000 crew members.

Overall though IMO I still thought it was ok, at least a watch once if you're curious about the concept and idea, but damn man, it could have been executed better.

Make it R-rated, make it a group of survivors (Could still have the focus on Mills and Koa) to add in a kill count and have the dinosaurs be more accurate as well as feature herbivores which funnily enough during production that's what they originally intended, seriously why did they drop that? We would've had a three-legged anklyosaurus and instead of what I assume was an oversized rauisuchian, it was going to be a triceratops which would had been better to showcase herbivores aren't always peaceful and can be aggressive, the idea the triceratops would've been like a territorial hippo or wild boar.

Finally we had a threatical dinosaur film that wasn't another Jurassic sequel and I loved the concept and idea of ancient astronauts landing on earth during the dinosaur age trying to survive. It should've been so much more.

1k2fvng,reddit,My review on Chungking Express (1994),"Holy hell! What a ride that was.

First aspect to be noted is the absolutely perfect cinematography. Every shot perfectly encapsulates the chaos, impersonality and loneliness of big cities.

I was instantly captured by the first cop's views on heartbreak. The way he views the expiration date of the relationship and the reflection on the expiration date of memories is beautifully touching.

The scene of him calling a bunch of women to see if anyone wanted to go on a date with him almost felt like a foreshadowing of what became of the dating scene in a more modern world where everything is so fast and liquid. But here there is also a heartwarming side of it - how he is genuinely happy when one of the women says she is married. He doesnt want a hookup - just company. And thats what makes his character so relatable. His humbleness and positive outlook on life even when he is very clearly hurting and suffering.

And in the second part comes Faye Wong and California Dreamin. This second part is less mysterious and whimsical than the first one but the chemistry between the two actors and the sexiness of every innocent interaction is palpable through the screen.

The second cop talks to every element of his house as if he is talking to his lost love. So it seems appropriate that the character of Faye shows up to basically organize his life and take care of his apartment. 

The bittersweet element of the almost connection. Of the small little moments of connections and mismatches are carefully portrayed again beautifully capturing the city of Hong Kong, the late night diners, the coffees and beers as a living breathing character in the story. The big chaos of the city looking for a escape of the loneliness - just like our two characters.

The fact that she becomes a stewardess and is always traveling in the end portraits how things can change in the blink of an eye. People are unpredictable and independent. One day theyre here and in the other they are gone. Life just keeps going on. 

Its my first Wong Kar Wai movie and I was mesmerized through the whole thing. 

Would love to hear your thoughts.

1jnwmud,reddit,Defending Your Life,"Who here has watched this movie? I've watched it about 10 times since it first came out in 1991, and I never get tired of it! What's more, I think they basically got it right about what happens after you die, which is pretty much in line with the Buddhist and Hindu beliefs in karma and reincarnation. However, I'd say the movie embraces too many superficial yuppie values from the 80s, with very little focus on how your actions affect others, not just yourself. What about the 30 or so people he accidentally killed on the bus? Shouldn't he have been punished for their deaths? And I think there's much more involved during the interim period between lifetimes than looking at a few critical days of your life to see what lessons you learned from them, in particular pertaining to dealing with fear. Sure, we all need to learn to deal with fear, which is a very big part of growth, but I think we need to learn a lot more lessons than just this, in particular, being responsible for the consequences of our actions, intentional or not, though intent carries a great deal more weight.

**Metacritic:** [N/A (updating)](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-working-man/)

**Some Reviews:**

[JoBlo's Movie Network](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/573) \- [Chris Bumbray](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/chris-bumbray)

>Jason Statham and David Ayer have a nice thing going. *The Beekeeper* revitalized their careers to a certain extent, with Ayer putting a superb polish on what could have been a run-of-the-mill action flick, turning into perhaps Statham’s best solo action vehicle. And now, they’re back at it again with the Sylvester Stallone-penned *A Working Man*, which is based on the novel “Levon’s Trade” by Chuck Dixon (a way better title than the Seagal-like *A Working Man*). 

[Casey's Movie Mania](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/3688) \- [Casey Chong](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/casey-chong)

>Some of the shortcomings aside, it’s worth noting that A Working Man is the first part of Chuck Dixon’s *Levon Cade* series, which has so far released a total of 11 books. For now, the movie gets off to a decent, though uneven beginning for a franchise starter and if there’s a sequel in the pipeline — depending on the first movie’s box-office result, of course — here’s hoping it improves for the next round.

[The Guardian - Jesse Hassenger](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/mar/26/a-working-man-review-jason-statham)

>At its best, a movie like A Working Man functions as an update to the hard-boiled detective story, with a resilient bruiser conducting his own off-books missing-person investigation. There’s a little of that juice as Levon does some amateur undercover work as a drug buyer, cozying up to a motorcycle gang (the aforementioned leader sits on a chrome throne, another touch that feels like Ayer’s doing). But Stallone and Ayer don’t have the patience for too much skullduggery; skullsmashery is more their thing, and as an action movie, A Working Man doesn’t reach the giddy highs of Statham’s best.

[Screen Rant - Mary Kassel](https://screenrant.com/a-working-man-movie-review/)

>It doesn't take an active imagination to see where the future of *A Working Man* is going. A few plots are left unresolved. Levon still has to win custody of his young daughter, paving the way for a sequel or two if the film makes a profit. Statham has proved himself an asset at the box office, and when it comes to movies like *A Working Man*, a critical reception has little to do with the project's performance. It's a mindless good time, and I'll be interested to see where the franchise goes.

[NextBestPicture - Dan Bayer](https://nextbestpicture.com/a-working-man/)

>For better or worse, “A Working Man” is pure brute force, barrelling through its standard (if overstuffed) plot with the subtlety of a sledgehammer, pummeling you into submission with its hard-hitting (if uninspired) fight scenes. You may not be wowed by the action on display here, but you feel every single body blow and gunshot. That’s exactly what you expect from a Statham vehicle, and that’s what “A Working Man” delivers, even if it doesn’t give you any more than that.

[The Reel Bits - Richard Gray](https://thereelbits.com/2025/03/27/review-a-working-man/)

>While never destined to revolutionise the genre, Ayer and Stallone have struck upon a reliable formula in a ready-made franchise package. One could happily consume these like fast food every couple of years, safe in the knowledge that there’s always another job for this working man right around the corner.

[Deadline](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2256) \- [Pete Hammond](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/pete-hammond)

>Ayer has made a bunch of films I really liked, particularly the cop drama *End Of Watch* which had a better role for Pena opposite Jake Gyllenhaal, and Brad Pitt’s WW2 tank epic, *Fury.* Here as in *Beekeeper,* he delivers a tightly wound action showcase for his star and keeps it moving along.

[Variety](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/466) \- [Peter Debruge](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/peter-debruge)

>This wasn’t how I envisioned Ayer’s career shaping up... A few of his movies are very good, but it increasingly feels like he’s recycling old plots, the way straight-to-tape action movies did in the late 20th century.

1jw0hrw,reddit,What are some of your favorite movie trailers?,"Here are some of mine:


Cruel Intentions: https://youtu.be/UzlKsS-IhEo?si=73QEZnZkFHTsKmat
 

- I like the way they blend music, and SMG is such a snake in this ... I love that it comes through in the feel of the movie. And gotta love that end cap scene, like trailers do. It's so representative of the movie and how tawdy and scandalous these characters are


Black Snake Moan: 
https://youtu.be/j7Z7Cf9IDGw?si=CFIIrIOBp9Zm0jSr


- I know a lot of people think this trailer gave the wrong impression of what the movie was actually about, but after seeing it I think it perfectly encapsulates what it's about. And the music is really well interwoven in it. But in particular I absolutely love the montage of Rhey giving into her vices, which I think a lot of us can relate to in one way or another for a lot of reasons. It's so colorful and punchy, and it's really cool how they edited it to mirror Rhey, giving it that pulpy vibe that's inherent in the movie's set up. Lastly, I think it's representative of how we glorify/romanticize hedonism (if that's the right word), despite how it might negatively impact our lives. 


Suicide Squad:
https://youtu.be/PLLQK9la6Go?si=wRjC2ZoWobUiK5dw


- Who didn't like this trailer? There's something special about it, with the song they used ... You can sense how impactful it should have been. But I personally suspect the reason people really vibe with it (and as is evidenced given the popularity of the character) is because it plays as though it's a story mainly revolving around Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn. I think there's something endearing about seeing people who exhibit different styles and qualities, which you get a wealth of here. It deepens people's sense of mystery and a person's complexity, but overall I think it's because she's high spirited, wild and free, while being kinda crazy that people see themselves (or who they wish they could be) in her ... A life force of epic proportions, going through the motions, but beautiful in their own peculiar and unique way. It's too bad the movie couldn't live up to this trailer. 

High Tension:
https://youtu.be/ZsfqXekOvJQ?si=5KxgKkZHuIdRNAHN

- This is a great little trailer for a relatively obscure horror movie. The cover song really makes it, as does the editing. 
Note that this isn't the exact trailer I was looking for, which lessens it's impact as an audio-visual wonder in my book. There's something missing right before it cuts to the chorus and things ramp up ... The original trailer was less jarring than that.

Really good performances across the board, with an ending that comes out of nowhere and gives me caution from recommending it to everyone I know (if you've seen it, you know) and then it just ends. 

All in all, a solid story about the past, our legacies, and what comes next.

It had the full range of big screen theatrics from the eye-popping color palettes in each sequence to the symphonic musical score. Especially, there are some gags that have the full impact when with an audience. There are also some stand out sequences making full use of the medium, and it even shifts art styles from the movie including a sequence like the opening to Who Framed Roger Rabbit and an Art Deco style sequence that calls back to the Pink Elephants animation from Dumbo.  
  
Better than the last Space Jam movie, but overall, the best out of all theatrical Looney Tunes movies to date. I can't describe how well written it is from being an homage and spoof of 1950s sci-fi B movies to a self contained story focusing on Porky and Daffy's friendship exclusively for this movie. It works as a buddy comedy, and I loved what they did with Petunia in terms of her character and the romance subplot with Porky. Everything is built on Porky and Daffy's connection throughout. It works more in comparison to Bugs missing the Tunes when in fact he rarely interacts with them since the original shorts don't have them crossover.  
  
All movie exclusive characters were excellent. Farmer Jim, The Invader, and even the Scientist all had a huge part to play in the movie especially for the comedy.  
  
There are a lot of jokes coming in the moment the opening credits started to roll. For a PG rated family movie, they definitely have stuff adults can enjoy. References to John Carpenter movies like The Thing and They Live, some off-color humor, and it does not feel juvenile. There is subtle commentary coming from Petunia about taking risks and not wanting to be bland. I get that.  
  
The first time I saw it had plenty of audible laughs in the auditorium. There are plenty of surprises, twists, and stand out moments that showcase the animators going above and beyond what was supposed to be a made for TV/streaming movie. And I'm glad they reverted back to its original title, otherwise ""Bubble Brains"" would have been a tough sell.  
  
You have a lot to invest in, the stakes are convincing, and whatever movie conventions it tries doing, you couldn't help but smile the whole way through.

  
This movie is a monumental achievement in 2D animation and the comedy genre on its own. It will looked back as a cult classic, probably a potential pick on AFI's Top 100 Funniest Movies / Greatest Animated Movies list.",2025-03-26 20:15:21,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,12,8,,0.66,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jklhhf/the_day_the_earth_blew_up_a_looney_tunes_movie_is/,rwinger24

I've never been exposed to this many neurological disorders as I got after I completed watching this movie (better for a med student definitely).

Randall, a god in sales; 15 mins into the movie and he becomes jobless due to his other god-tier skill : swaying girls - cut - sitting around a table with his overly qualified family of medical background, celebrating his younger brother's success. He joins Pfizer, get beaten up by the ex-marine, Trey *but also* gets the main gurl - Maggie whe has Parkinson.

Now what I loved about this movie was —

- Randall wanting sex only gradually fell for her
- his anxious proposal which she turns down ergo
- his life becoming mundane and him waiting for her bus which moved Maggie
- their budding relationship; the cherry blossom stage all good all sweet
- comes the convention and acceptance phase altogether and 
- him taking her around to get her cured and her breaking up with him

Okay, everyone wants to feel love but the burden and responsibilities that come with it, fewer wish to tackle them.

1k5hw6m,reddit,"5 Centimeters Per Second, if you stare at the campfire too long you'll watch the whole world go by.","I just seen this movie, the more and more I think about it the more and more it gets to me, it's message is so sad and it's ending unfulfilling and that's what makes it so good.

It's an anime movie from 2007 by Makoto Shinkai (Your Name, Weathering With You, Suzume etc.)

This movie is extremely realistic and gut wrenching, a story about how important it is to move on because if you stand still you'll end up choking yourself physically and mentally and you won't find any peace.

It's extremely impressive how powerful and heartbreaking this story is even though it's only 1 hour.

Spoilers ahead:

Maybe it's because I'm a guy as well but I had assumed Akari would be waiting for him too, or they'd at least maintain contact and try to give themselves a chance at least once. Like Takaki, the idea of her moving on and choosing to keep him in the past was unexpected and heartbreaking, but what hurt even more was realizing that all that time he spent thinking about her and staring back into what was and yearning/chasing for that moment, he missed so many opportunities to live his life to the fullest, while to her he is merely a memory and has moved on. And the fact that they spent the same night together and had the same feelings for one another all those years ago makes it so much worse. I can't shake this feeling of emptiness and lack of closure after watching this movie, and I'm now realizing that's exactly how Tataki feels.

The train scene is what brings it all together, Tataki choosing to look back because he's been longing for that moment and person from long ago and hasn't moved on so much time later. Akari, while realizing it could very well be him, keeps walking, choosing to keep him in the past as she did.....long ago

On one hand I'm frustrated at Akari for forgetting so easily and leaving Takaki in this state of limbo in his life, but she doesn't know that, how could she? Why should she? And how should she be expected to put her life on pause? It's heartbreaking but the world moves on. Her choosing to press on is completely understandable. Why hold on to a fleeting memory for so long? The time they shared should be cherished but life goes on, Takaki should've realized this and not choke himself everyday for someone he lost contact with ages ago.

But on the other hand I understand Takaki's perspective too, to care for something so much and not get proper closure, and to know for the rest of your life you won't ever get to conclude that core part of your childhood from so long ago is so frustrating and unfulfilling. The feeling of desire you will never be able to shake or move on from must be so hard. Hard enough to look past the things you have going for you now and zone in on something you will never be able to reach, not even a centimeter closer.

At first I was like ""that was neat"" but the more I think about this movie the more I cherish it. I can't shake this tale lmao this movie has you thinking about it the same way the protag thinks about what was and what he longed for from his past. But you shouldn't, you can't, the moments gone, it's in the past. It's important to grow, move on, push forward, because if you don't you are only hurting yourself and the people who want to be in your life. Let it go and keep walking into the uncertainty of the future, one centimeter at a time.",2025-04-22 21:19:21,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,11,4,,0.72,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1k5hw6m/5_centimeters_per_second_if_you_stare_at_the/,WantedOutlaw

1k01322,reddit,Forrest Gump and importance of shoes,"While the film Forrest Gump has an obvious connection to shoes via his famous Nikes and the opening dialogue, I've noticed it continues deeper throughout. The film makes reference to shoes both through dialogue and visuals, a few of which I'm only noticing recently, which are as follows:

Gump's line to the first visitor on the bench about being able to tell a lot about a person by their shoes, to which she replies that her feet hurt. The woman is dressed as a housekeeper of some kind, and even though Forrest compliments their quality, she suffers. I believe this is making social commentary, whether it be about the struggle of the working class, or maybe about perspective on life, I haven't fully dissected.

Gump's own first shoes are connected to braces, maybe this speaks on perseverance in the face of adversity.

When Forrest and Bubba meet Lieutenant Dan, he tells them to take care of their feet and shoes due to rainfall and gangrene.

Lieutenant Dan loses his feet and is then completely lost in life, and mentions his struggling with the phrase ""walk with god"".

Lieutenant Dan only reconciles with his life after relinquishing to the ocean, effectively being off his legs altogether.

When Jenny is facing the decision to commit suicide, she is depicted standing on a ledge in the most flimsy, ankle-breaking heeled sandals, that teeter, which then snaps her to save herself. I think this might be speaking on the stability of her life or mental state.

Jenny is the one that gives Forrest his favorite shoes during what he calls the happiest time of his life. When she leaves he spends 3+ years with the shoes, running.

Jenny throws her shoes at her father's house. Her feet are filthy. Forrest's shoes are pristine.

Lieutenant Dan shows Forrest his new ""magic legs"", wearing very nice shoes, as he reveals a complete change in outlook on life.

The feather is shown at Forrest's feet at both the opening and ending.

There could be more; please comment if you think of any!

1jqjrau,reddit,Highly recommend the Regal Unlimited pass,"I’m no shill for Regal, and have some problems with their lack of independent/lesser known films, for the record. 

I have recently quit drinking (91 days), and as a result, I have been sleeping much better, and therefore have been simply just having more time. The escapism and love of seeing films in a theater has been an even more intense passion, as it helps me deal with sobriety and provides a much-needed activity to steer the planning of my days around something other than drinking.

Anyway the Regal pass, for me here in Washington state, is $24.99. I am having a blast, taking on a fun challenge of trying to see literally every movie I possibly can. Definitely things I would never normally see or have zero interest in.

For instance, yesterday I went to the library for a bit, and at the theater next door realized the timing was perfect and just went to see Paddington In Peru on a whim. Because it was there. It was delightful! I am a 44 year old man without kids, and I would never have seen that otherwise. Then I took my dad to see the late show of the movie Locked last night, which i had wanted to see. We had a private screening, just the two of us!

After work and errands etc today, I’m going to see Captain America, and will probably be the only person in theater. I couldnt possibly care less about most comic book/Marvel movies, but hey, maybe it’ll be surprise me.

1jmof6x,reddit,What movies would you recommend for older family members who haven’t really been exposed to films or literature throughout their lives?,"Looking for movies with which everyone should be familiar

My in laws are immigrants from a very rural area, “parents were subsistence farmers in the mountains” rural, and their academic education did not make it very far. 

As such, their exposure to literature, both written and filmed, has been limited. 

They’re very intelligent people, they watch the evening news every day and have no problem keeping up with the intricacies of *why* things happen, and can relate things happening in the US easily between patterns they’ve seen in El Salvador. 

However, their life experience has been limited to things they have personally experienced, and I believe the great value of literature is expanding our world beyond the lived experience. (I consider films to be literature, not just books)

As such, we would like to come up with a list of essentially the western canon, but in film. 

What are the movies you think everyone should watch, movies that set up or include structures seen in other works, movies that expose people to classic storylines, even if not the original story, and movies that are, above all, entertaining?

Bonus points if the movie is known to have a great Spanish dub. We want to avoid subtitles for now. 

Shrek would be a movie I consider part of the western canon, for example, and it has a great Spanish dub, but I would not feel it’s a good option to start them with it given that it requires knowledge or familiarity fairy tales, fantasy tropes, and satire to enjoy.

So, with this in mind, what are some films you think would be good for the goal of exposing our parents to these movies and build up their cultural knowledge, worldly experience, and enjoyment?",2025-03-29 15:12:29,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,13,41,,0.69,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jmof6x/what_movies_would_you_recommend_for_older_family/,JulioCesarSalad

The storytelling, the backstory, the bad-ass that is Merida. Plus it’s really funny. But I cannot watch it. I have an awful “relationship” with my mother/maternal figures in general. I won’t get into it too much, but essentially she abandoned me and my dad a bunch of times when I was really little. Then I grew up as the kid without a mom and then had one really shitty maternal figure. Her and my dad broke up and I had/have someone who doesn’t respect my boundaries when it comes to maternal things. She tries to be my mother and then acts offended when I’m uncomfortable with it.

1k1yh3u,reddit,[spoilers] Rewatched the Green Mile last night after finishing the audiobook,"I love how the movie really has you questioning your own morality in places. If I'd read Delacroix's crime on a reddit headline, I'd think exactly like those watching his execution. Yet seeing it in person, especially with how badly it went, well. No human deserves that.

Then again, his seven victims, even accidental ones, didn't deserve their fates either.

Another puzzle: Percy. He's such a disgusting scum guzzling slimeball that I can't help feel an odd perverse joy whenever he's bullied or assaulted in this movie. It's fun seeing him in pain when he's getting his ears tugged or the whimpers he makes in the restraint room. None of that compares to what he did to Del (and Mr. Jingles), and he likely never was punished as a child so it's long overdue.

Then I have to wonder: if I'm enjoying his pain, does that make me, on some level, as bad as him? For stepping on a mouse & tormenting a rapist/murderer does that make Wharton's sexual assault of Percy ""okay""? Did he deserve Coffey's ""punishment"", before he could go on to torment mentally ill patients at the asylum?

So many questions and no right or wrong answers, really. 

I cried three times tonight tho I know this film almost by heart. First at Del's execution, then at John watching the movie and lastly, of course, at John's execution. The awestruck, almost childlike joy in John watching the movie actually made me mourn a little. How I miss the days of simply enjoying things without, well, gestures vaguely at Current Events.

1k0bfur,reddit,Thoughts on Swiss Army Man ending?,"I loved the movie. It was so tender and sweet and funny. But I didn't like that in the third act it seems like Paul Dano's character has just been living in the woods behind Sarah's house. It made the character a lot harder to sympathize with. A guy hiding in the woods behind your house making dolls that look like you is terrifying.

One of the themes is learning to accept yourself and not be ashamed of being weird. But stalking someone is weird and absolutely something to be ashamed of. It feels like the movie sabotages its own message.

Was this just the Daniels trying to make the story as bizarre as possible? I get that Dano's character is supposed to be weird and maladjusted and moderately creepy, but why take it that far?

I feel like so many stories and movies start with an amazing concept but then ruin it by not stopping sooner and making the story too complicated.

I did like the final scene with Radcliffe farting off into the sunset.

I am confused now. I thought the plan was to maintain the con even after it ended. But the fake FBI agent says, ""Hello Henry,"" so Lonnegan definitely knows that his name is Henry and not Shaw.

1joq0bg,reddit,Spider-Man Into The Spiderverse felt like a dream.,"Spider-Man Into The Spiderverse felt like a dream. A very good one. I threw it into my Blu Ray player while feeling quite sick and did not expect very much. I am quite sceptical when it comes to superhero movies nowadays. But this one surprised me.

It tells a multidimensional story while staying simple enough for newcomers. With Kingpin and his supporters, not only does that story find a very well defined villain but also a clear direction in which it heads without having to tease some other stories along the way. 

Together with the soundtrack, which is filled with hip hop, it also manages to draw the feelings of a teenager and the conflicts he has to endure in a surprisingly empathic and realistic manner, so that the audience can easily connect to the protagonist.

The imagery is flawless. It's a living and moving comic panel, full of creativity and heart. The style changes quickly along the action yet it does not overwhelm the viewer so that they can follow along. 

All in all, it's a good movie that made use of its origins. I can understand why it's so beloved around cinephiles. And when it was over, it felt like a wild, weird but beautiful dream had just ended.

1k5g26m,reddit,Mistrial (1996) is one of the most eye-rolling movies I've ever watched.,"This movie is basically if somebody saw 12 Angry Men and went but what if the jury was a buncha meanies and that's why you can't trust them :(

  
While it started out pretty solid, it went off the rails pretty quickly around 15-minutes in.

SPOILERS AHEAD FOR THIS MOVIE IF YOU ACTUALLY CARE TO WATCH (please don't):

The ""Hero"" of this movie played by Bill Pullman (what a waste of talent) who is in charge of an investigation of the homicide of two police officers. The first half of the movie revolves around his hunt for the perpetrator which leads him to the suspect who is an ex of one of the officers. Emotionally viscerated by the brutality of the crime, our hero decides to forgo proper procedures, catches the ex trying to flee which leads to a fight which leads to OUR HERO SHOOTING DOWN THE INNOCENT WIFE AND BROTHER of the ex. This ends with him getting a bag of evidence with some letters and bullet casings from the suspect. The second half of the movie is basically a legal drama about how the mean justice system discarded these evidence under unlawful search and seizure with no warrant. (He shot those two people in their own home where they lived with the suspect btw), which eventually leads to a jury finding the suspect Not Guilty.

NOW, at this point in the movie where I was FULLY interested (and a bit annoyed at our hero cop's personality) in how will they solve this case legally and get to the truth. OUR HERO SHOOTS A GUN IN THE COURTROOM right after the verdict is announced and TAKES THE JURY, JUDGE AND THE SUSPECT AS HOSTAGE. 

This third half of the movie that just went COMPLETELY off the rails is basically more than half hour of mostly a one-sided soapbox peachy speech about how the poor police officer got messed over because of stupid things like """"rule of law"""" and """"procedure"""". In the meantime outside the courtroom, the hallways are packed with armed police, paramedics and a hostage negotiator. The movie makes it an explicit point about showing how so many cops didn't wanted to go inside to subdue our hero because ""they don't want to shoot another cop"" because I kid you not one of them says ""That could've been me chief, I've been in some situations"".  Let me repeat that in this movie MULTIPLE officers of the law REFUSED to engage in an ACTIVE HOSTAGE SITUATION with multiple people at risk because they were afraid they might hesitate the take the shot. 

and that isn't even the most infuriating scene in the movie, no no no the honor of most jaw dropping awe inspiringly bullshit line in the movie comes when the police commissioner of our hero manages to get inside the courtroom to talk him down, which leads to Our hero of this story, our protector of the law to utter the lines :

""He killed two cops, And what's worse, he made me kill.""

The utter lack of remorse and guilt and the hand-wavyness reaction of once again THE PROTAGONIST over his killing of TWO INNOCENT CIVILLIANS, is just showed as ""part of the hardships of fighting crime"". 

To call this pile of mess a copaganda film would be a disservice to other movies and tv shows that actually make people WANT to become police officers because I refuse to believe this movie can be seen as any other way than highlighting the nature of law enforcement to support problematic elements just because they belong in the same line of work.  This is not my opinion btw, this is literally what's inferred by one of the lines in the movie : 

""You know why they hate us, Captain?

Because we have a code.

We believe in something.

We believe in each other."" 

Treating the refusal of holding someone you know accountable for their actions as ""betraying the code"".

The movie ends (thank god) with him finally surrendering while having achieved nothing.

He let the killer walk because of unlawful arrest, He killed two innocent civilians during said arrest, he destroyed his life and the life  of his wife and two kids, He got MULTIPLE OFFICERS either fired or demoted for not following orders and worst of all he wasted my time on this earth that I spent watching this godawful movie hoping any second it might turn around and give me a surprise of being an actually good one.

The grainy looks and old-new tech gives it some realism that usually is missing from modern movies.
