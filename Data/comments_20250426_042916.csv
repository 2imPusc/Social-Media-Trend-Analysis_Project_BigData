Hope faltered, and it seemed as though none could stop steady march of the Helpers...

It's their final planning meeting now, and they burn their phones in a trashcan by the old 95... they say their prayers to whichever gods they believe in.

When we played ping pong in the garage with the garage door open, though, it would become difficult.  Thumper wanted to hump a leg and was really aggressive about it.  Sometimes, you'd have to constantly kick him off your leg, but he kept coming back.

Rabbits are interesting pets.  They're friendly (too friendly, if they're like Thumper) but I don't think you can train them not to poop in your house, making them outdoor pets.  They're very soft and do like being pet.  They're not brilliant, but they're smarter than they look.",2025-04-17 12:42:02,1,realnanoboy,funny

- Small party or small order will almost always guarantee little to no service (had a server walk off last time & never come back. Sorry Betty, I’m on a diet, but I want to hang out with my friend)
- Asking for clarification (Had a server tell me a different weight that what it said on the menu, asked for verification because it was different on 2 different menus & did not match what server had said)
- Promised drink or appetizers to go into bar/restaurant (waited 45m for 1st round of PAID drinks. The place was empty - literally 2 other table which arrived after us & served. Never received drinks. Manager was extremely rude about it saying it’s busy if I didn’t know how a restaurant works).
- Shift Mismanagement (This one has happens often. Had order taken couple of times before it’s cool when they catch it early. I remember 1x we waited 1h30m - didn’t want to be that guy. Manager came at that point & had the audacity to ask me to shift my face because I looked unhappy. That’s when I asked for free food & got it. It was for 14 people. Still came out cold.)
- Rats at Fine Establishments (This one has gotten me free stuff by reporting, documenting, & keeping quiet. Have gotten to break few rules by this ex. Tourist with sandals at a nightclub/restaurant)",2025-04-18 04:45:21,-2,monioum_JG,funny

The motto stands - or rather stood - in three mile high illuminated letters near the Complaints Department spaceport on Eadrax. Unfortunately its weight was such that shortly after it was erected, the ground beneath the letters caved in and they dropped for nearly half their length through the offices of many talented young Complaints executives - now deceased.
The protruding upper halves of the letters now appear, in the local language, to read ""Go stick your head in a pig,"" and are no longer illuminated, except at times of special celebration.""

During my time on a couple of projects in Cape Town, I had a black South African driver named Dee. He remains the funniest person I have ever met in my life, even though that was well over ten years ago. I think about him often.

At the time, I was going through a breakup, and I shared this with him. I honestly would’ve paid to see a stand-up comedy show as funny as the jokes he made over the following two weeks. He was a stranger, but he could tell I needed cheering up, and he went out of his way to make me happy. Thinking back, it was such a kind thing for him to do. 

He basically made out that the whole thing must’ve been my fault, and kept telling me that I don’t know how to treat women properly. I told him that I also been divorced once. I can still hear and saying: “Jesus on the cross little boy, how can such a busy little man like you find time to ruin so many lives!?”. 

I was a really senior member of the project… and he would go around loudly saying stuff like this to other people I was working with! I met his wife in the first thing she said to me in front of a room full of people: “Are you that little man who can’t please a woman!?”. 

He was like 6’ 5, and big as a house, and I was the skinny little white guy from England. He teased me so much and it was really really funny. Exactly what I needed at the time.",2025-04-15 18:56:06,7,Funny-Presence4228,funny

mkt1z6t,1joclyd,reddit,"This is from the tail-end of the Honda golden age, but fairly accurate.  

Only fairly.  The original trans likely won't exceed 150K (mine lasted 250, but it's from a decade earlier, rebuild still going strong), and you need to be doing regular maintenance.  This mileage is ~3 timing belts in, water pump, most of the exhaust system.  All the lines, all of them.  Hopefully it's kept indoors.  If not, expect also rust-replacements and maybe an AC overhaul.  A number of fuses and sensors, and a couple valves.  The $2500 price tag is only decent if all of that has been done.  Expect a trans rebuild to be $4K.  That said compared to $25K for a modern piece of crap, still worth the work.  The engine was always its best feature.  People have used a 3.0L V6 Accord engine in small aircraft, the model before the one in the ad.  

Incidentally if you want bluetooth or rear cameras on your old car, you can simply buy a $200 kit from Crutchfield.  And Hondas are eminently accessorizable.",2025-04-01 04:22:58,4,YuunofYork,funny

mmoj1tl,1jwqdng,reddit,"For the curious: in Chinese they don’t have what we would call prepositions and a lot of the relationships between words are understood by context.

The first two characters of the bottom line translate as an imperative “Be careful!” The last two characters literally mean “fall water”, but translating into proper English it would end up being, “fall (or falling) into the water.”

Based on context there is an implied “about” between the first two characters and the last two, so it reads very naturally in Chinese as “Be careful (about) falling in the water.”

The other thing is that Chinese love four character combinations, so they will often create grammatically simplified stock phrases of four characters which wouldn’t be used in everyday speech, but work well for signs.

The meticulously thought sublime arrangement of various common letters represent the microcosmos of our current state of society and social media slang where seemingly arbitrary arrangement of letters and lives are given new meaning in the ever evolving cyberspacetime. The meaning only makes sense to those who are in the know and learning the meaning is a step towards spiritual enlightment that we all strive towards. It's a harsh reminder to common rabble that no matter how much one tries and stares, some information is controlled by others and can not be reached.

mo69218,1k3nljy,reddit,"I was in my junior year of college when 9/11 happened.

Many teachers on campus canceled class. But not my Microbiology professor. His attitude was that nothing happened to any of us at our school, so there was no reason to cancel class. He thiught we should take our exam, and carry on as if tomorrow would arrive and everything would be normal.  

 The next week he verbally berated us for having severely below average test scores from that exam.  He was irrate the class had done so poorly, as it looked bad on him.  I found out later several students reported him, not just for this test incident, but for singling out students for bullying and harassment.  

He was without a doubt, the most self centered, egotistical, petty, non empathetic jerk I ever met.  When he killed himself years later, after being caught cheating on his wealthy wife with another man, not a whole lot of people were surprised. And not a whole lot of them attended his funeral.

(Tangent, i completely forgot that they did a Peter Pan movie with Jim Gaffigan as Smee)

The Disney remakes that make money are the 90s films. If you grew up in the 90s watching Beauty and the Beast as a kid, you’re probably in your mid-30s or early-40s, and you’re going to see the live action remake, and take your kids.

It hurts when you see movies they put hundreds of millions come out in such a low quality especially when there are small studious (in conparasion at least) that have passion and put out really great animations with a MUCH smaller budget. 
I know that movies and live action remakes have much bigger costs but cartoons and animations also don't have any big new titles for pretty long time while still costing insane amounts of money.

I really think that they should take notes from some of the titles like Helluva Boss, Hazbin Hotel and Murder Drones.

""Do you remember that I told you how I had this tremendous urge to put my penis in the pickle slicer?""

""Oh god, Jim, you didn't!""

""My God, Jim, what happened?""

mnijiok,1k10yja,reddit,"> A burlesque is a literary, dramatic or musical work intended to cause laughter by caricaturing the manner or spirit of serious works, or by ludicrous treatment of their subjects.[1] The word is loaned from French and derives from the Italian burlesco, which, in turn, is derived from the Italian burla – a joke, ridicule or mockery.[2][3]

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burlesque

So, yeah, sounds like an excellent way to encourage enquiring minds.

In cities like Shanghai, people who make these signs normally do it right because more people actually speak English so there's a higher possibility the sign designer understands what he or she's doing.

In other cities especially small or rural areas, people use translate softwares to design signs. The designers are taking English words as some kind of decorations, making the sign ""international"", or as we say in Chinese, ""洋气""(western, international, cool). The workers putting them on don't understand what they are doing at all too and sometimes putting them on wrong (like wrong spelling or something).
