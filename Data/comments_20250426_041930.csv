Living alone and not being able to care for yourself anymore and not being able to leave the house anymore is of course horrible. But an old person living alone and living their best life? Hell yea. 

I became disabled in my late 20s and I live alone but it's getting harder. I look at those fit 80-something with a lot of admiration and some envy. That's the ultimate ""cool"" to me and I know they feel the same way.

mmoveap,1jx7eek,reddit,"Watched a lot of his stuff.  Judge Middleton runs a court where prosecution needs to be on point and defense counsel gets a lot of leeway.  I mean, all his defendants are “free counsel” types and the defense attorney was given the case 10 minutes prior.

He is very lenient and does not like to put people in jail, especially if you have a job.

His court was made famous during COVID when a girlfriend beater was in zoom court.  The arresting officer and prosecutor mentioned to the judge that the defendant (abuser) was on zoom in the victims house.

He was still living in the home of his victim where the judge had a protective order placed on the victim.  On zoom police showed up to the victim’s address and arrested the abuser right there on zoom court for violation of a protective order.

Had a very good explanation as to why when a victim asks for a protective order, it must be enforced regardless of the victim’s consent because the abuse will only continue.",2025-04-12 05:46:55,19,colin8651,funny

Turns out, while the Romans only trained young riders once they were tall enough to mount  and control horses, Sarmatians taught their children to ride dogs, then pigs, then ponies, before they graduated to full-on warhorses.

mm5xvtr,1juxpqn,reddit,"Tlaloc and Bheki ain't having none of that.

This story is very similar to an old folk tale from my country called ""2 Pesos of Rain"".

An old remote village would throw in a penny into the stone well whenever they needed rain for their crops. On one especially hard summer, no rain came despite their repeated coin tosses. For weeks and weeks every villager donated what they could scrounge together to throw in a few pennies to the well, each throwing a few more than the last in the hopes that Mother Nature would heed their cry for help and bless them with rain, but no rain came. Crops were destroyed, cattle was skin and bones, and the bodies of children who had died of thirst littered the streets.

One day, the old widow, tired of seeing her people suffer, took all her life's savings that she had put away for her dead grandchildren, and in her grief, poured 2 pesos worth of pennies into the well. It was a fortune, enough to feed a family for a year, all thrown without a second thought into the depths of the well.

At this, the God of Rain took notice. What was happening down there for such tribute to be given? Surely this merited attention, and recompense. He had been waiting until the end of the mid year to shower the countryside with his blessing, but this could not be ignored. This could not go unrewarded.

It rained. It rained for days and weeks with such ferocity that no living being was spared. Within a month, the entire town, which had consisted of old rickety wooden houses, had been washed away. Not a trace was left of the people who had once lived there, nor of their history.

Only the well remained.",2025-04-09 05:17:47,1477,Fortwaba,funny

mnvpmmt,1k2erz4,reddit,"Hiking in the high desert south of sierra vista AZ. 

Along a ridge line. 

Got up to a peak and took a break sitting along a large flat sunning rock. 

Along to the next peak. Sat on a small flat rock and leaned back enjoying the smells and sounds. Looked over to previous peak. Pretty sure I’m staring right at the sunning rock we were just sitting on. 

Huge mountain lion. Sitting, but not fully relaxed. I swear it’s staring right at us. 

Girl I’m hiking with takes some lipstick out of her bag (don’t ask why she had it on a desert hike) and draws a big ‘x’ on 3 sides of the rock we took a break at. 

With a little trepidation, we move on to the next peak along the ridge. 

Get to the very top and look back at our old peak. Right by the lipstick marked rock…big mountain lion. This time I’m certain…he’s looking right at us. 

Enter the coldest, loneliest sense of dread I’d ever care to meet. 

We take a break and decide what to do. Recall what I can about mountain lion hunting techniques. Figure he’s waiting for us to double back so he can set up an ambush. 

Glance back at the second peak. No cat. He’s gone. 

We chart a path down the peak along the most barren section, away from the protected vegetation near the mountains and down into the more bare desert. 

I un-sheath my K-Bar figuring it gives me one swing if I hear it in time and give one of us a chance to save the other if the ambush is successful. 

Walked back the long way. Several miles through exposed desert. In near silence. Thankful we had started early and darkness was still hours further away. 

Never saw the cat again. Maybe it was nothing. 

But it was the first time I felt like my position at the top of the food chain was in jeopardy. I’ve rarely felt that sense of dread.",2025-04-19 04:54:25,7,Individual_Reach_732,funny

mnvq0p7,1k2erz4,reddit,"I’m in the PNW, NorCal. I live in the country on a hill amongst the giant redwoods. These cats have huge territories, sometimes as big as 100 square miles. When they’re patrolling, it takes about a week and a half for them to make an entire loop. There have been many years where a big cats’ territory runs right along the downhill slope of the hill I live on. I know when one is making its way through the brush because my dog is going absolutely apeshit. Also, the ravens who I make friends with by feeding them scraps let me know as well. They fly above wherever a predator is in a tight circle squawking wildly. I’ve shined a flashlight down there in the night and seen those huge green yellow orbs just staring back out of the blackness. Other times I’ll toss small pieces of wood and rocks down to encourage it to move along.

mosl1v7,1k6ow25,reddit,"This happened to me. I was at the Prado looking at what I learned was an alternate version of The Mona Lisa painted I believe by a student of Divinci when I noticed a young woman standing next to me also looking at the same painting. 

I saw her face. I looked back at the painting. Back at her face. Then just instinctually blurted out, “hey, omg, you look like the Mona Lisa” 

She didn’t really respond. So I tried to say it again before realizing she didn’t speak English. I tried to explain in gestures and kind, goofy basic caveman English and I think she understood, but I was blown away. 

And this is coming from a person who finds it annoying when ppl compare others to “lookalikes” if they don’t really “look alike.” It was a stunning uncanny comparison. She was truly beautiful. And I never thought the classic Mona Lisa was all that pretty, but standing in the presence of that real girl, I totally understand what Leonardo was on about. She really was naturally gorgeous. 

 I still feel it was a special moment from my perspective, bc what are the odds really? That girl, at that moment, at that spot, and not even a third person I could ask to see what I was seeing.",2025-04-24 14:23:32,1,PatrickWagon,funny

mmr85x1,1jxf2a5,reddit,"Want to see FB Marketplace at its worst? List baby items. I had a $500 stroller I was selling for $80, and I probably talked to over 30 moms over the course of 2 months who inquired. They would beg for me to give it to them for free, or discount to $20 or less, or ask me to bring it to them 30+ miles away - the sob stories were wild. Two different girls came over to buy it for the listed price, then asked for it for free cause ""I'm already here"".

A third lady came over 5 hours earlier than arranged, I was still at work, and tried to convince my wife I listed it for free. When she didn't believe that, the lady tried to snatch it and run out the door, but my wife has the quickness and the stroller was a bit too large to just snatch up. She denied to me vehemently that she did that and said my wife (who is basically a living Disney princess) was a liar and was creating drama for fun.

After multiple months and dozens of messages, I never sold the stroller. One day we were having lunch at our neighborhood park and my wife spied a girl with a newborn and a stroller that had seen better days. She ran home and grabbed the stroller and we gave it to her - she was happy like she won a sweepstakes or something.

mmt0xoq,1jxf2a5,reddit,"This is crazy and hilarious, but I am absolutely not phased at all.

I’ve had some wild experiences on marketplace, and Craig’s List before that…

One time I was selling a car, a 96 Honda Prelude in 2015… so naturally it wasn’t gonna be perfect. I’d swapped the engine and trans, repainted it, done stereo and interior upgrades, etc. but I had already bought my new car to replace it, my 350z. So it had sat with only nominal driving for about a year before I finally parted with it(I owned it for 9 years).

Kid and I agree on a price, he shows up. Looks at it, drives it around the block. I offered to drive it as well, show him the VTEC and everything was working well at full tilt(I was a little older, 24 at the time so i knew when and where I could push the “law”). Completely honest with him about everything. Told him he could take it to a mechanic for an inspection if he wanted to.

No, no, he said. Gives me the cash and off he goes. Not a week later he texts me “it’s getting hot”. Ok, I responded the radiator is old, I didn’t change it with the engine. Probably needs replaced. He asked me to pay for it. LMAO. No dude, sorry. Then another week goes by and “the clutch is going out.” I said “I’m sorry to hear that, I hope you can get it worked out.”

Obviously at this point I know he’s out racing every night he has a chance to. Not that that matters, and I expected it. It’s just that type of car.

But dude, really? People have lost their fucking minds when it comes to any kind of buying or selling or negotiating from private party transactions… you buy a budget performance car for less than $4000 and expect it to be a street/track monster out of the box.",2025-04-12 22:29:15,3,Jak_n_Dax,funny

ml56f7f,1jq70e3,reddit,"Predinsone 10mg, 48 count for 12 days is a common taper dose amount.

- 6 tabs (60mg total) PO for Days 1-4
- 4 tabs (40mg total) PO for Days 5-8
- 2 tabs (20mg total) PO for Days 9-12

Take with food to help prevent an upset stomach that some can get when taking prednisone. Also you do not need to take all 6 at once as long as it is 60mg in the day. It can make it hard for some people to fall asleep so if you find that to be the case, take in the morning to help.

I would still recommend verifying with pharmacist who should be able to pull up the RX image (likely an eRX anyway) or your doctor.

Last time I was in retail a lot of the common prednisone dose tapers we had a quick code that we could type in and it would auto-populate the taper directions. 

Easier to dispense the dose pack to the patient that has the taper explained on the back but they are also more expensive so pharmacies will prefer the bulk bottles to keep on shelf and use to dispense.",2025-04-03 03:33:42,13,DelirousDoc,funny

Anyway i wanted him to explain why anyone should choose a religion that purports to be tailor made for the hebrew people only, that is very pro genocide of anyone who isnt hebrew, and doesnt distinguish between killing an enemy soldier and a newborn baby. 

I’ll remember his response, it was something very much or exactly like: “Well things were different then”

And that was pretty much what i expected him to say so came right in with a “why”. Gottem. Well god sent his son to “save the jews he ministered to and embolden them under roman oppression?” Well but god gave *everyone* the chance at redemption “you mean like the hundreds of billions of people with no exposure to jesus, god, christians, jews, or any relevant bible?”

Well god made it possible to see and believe in him even if you dont hear his apostles if we open our hearts to him

“So youre saying all gods are really just the Christian God so it doesn’t matter who we worship?”

NO! I mean

“Oh so we can all come to the exact same realization as you even without you knocking on our doors?”

I can see you have a lot of questions, my wife is more of a scholar than i am can i come back with her?

-

To be fair they did come back but his wife wasnt much of a scholar, she didnt say much and what she did say was very remedial sounding. She quoted the dumb scripture, and by that i mean the fluff in the New Testament like john 3:16. It’s hopeful, but in the greater context of understanding the Bible it’s worthless.

So there we were in this magical space and I figured it would be the best place to do it. I pull on her arm and start confessing my love, but she's only half paying attention. I power through and finally pull the ring out and she starts jumping for joy and gave the most enthusiastic ""YES"" I've ever heard. I can still hear it to this day. A crowd gathers and applauds us and a few people even share pics and videos. Staff at a local shop even pulled us in to create this custom video in front of a green screen where we are acting like the wizards in different scenes. It was awesome.

That said, it was still bothering me that she didn't pay attention to the heavily rehearsed proposal. I asked her what was up and she said ""Didn't you notice, the giant dragon above us started breathing fire at the exact moment you grabbed my hand. I was wondering why the hell you were interrupting it.""

mmpm87s,1jvu39z,reddit,"Speaking as a man, who touches grass, I’m very uncomfortable these videos, the people who make them, and the people who share them.

It’s not hard to understand why, but I imagine many of you haven’t stopped to consider the context.

1: they’re showing young attractive women from a creeper vantage point

2: they’re sexualizing these women, who are just walking around, existing, by making sexual innuendos

3: they show the women laughing or reacting to the absurdity, but smoothbrains watching this think ‘see they think it’s funny’

4: people watching these videos are given the opportunity to sexualize women from the comfort of their couch while the context of the video let’s them pretend that isn’t the intention, that they’re just watching this for the ‘humor content’

5: the creators gain money and influence from this by harassing people but hey it’s okay because they laugh initially. OP even titled it “First girl was getting into it!”

mkgjkrj,1jmwd33,reddit,"> My **13 year old** autistic son has set up surveillance on us.

he has caught on how ""trickle down economics"" of the ruling class works.


“I think that people with autism are born outside the regime of civilization. Sure, this is just my own made-up theory, but I think that, as a result of all the killings in the world and the selfish planet-wrecking that humanity has committed, a deep sense of crisis exists. Autism has somehow arisen out of this. Although people with autism look like other people physically, we are in fact very different in many ways. We are more like travelers from the distant, distant past. And if, by our being here, we could help the people of the world remember what truly matters for the Earth, that would give us a quiet pleasure.”

motbyte,1k6re70,reddit,"Loooong time ago I used to work in a very controlled office, where usb or any data storage device couldn't be brought in or taken out. 

My friend is visiting me from abroad and asks me if I can help him find the movie 100 girls, ( it's a movie about a guy who sleeps with a girl in an elevator during a black out at a girls hostel, then tries to find her by trying to have sex with many of those women or something like that). 

No worries I load up limewire, find the movie, download it and burn it on a CD ROM. Put the cd in the back of my car and drive to get my friend from the airport, we have some lunch, go bowling, then it's time for his next flight, I drop him at the airport and he flies away. 

A couple of years pass, I am now a senior officer in the same office, I go in an out of office on my car everyday. One day a military style guard stops me and tells me there is some cd in the back, I am surprised, usually I am very careful about such stuff. They confiscate the cd and tell me the IT department will have to look through it. Sure no problem turns out it's the 100 girls, they call me in the IT department where 12 grown men are watching the movie. Then we share a laugh. Two days later the same guard while returning my dvd to me asks me if he can keep it, I tell him sure why not.",2025-04-24 16:32:21,16,AleeEmran,funny

Good luck on the healing, and give it lots of time before you try to test drive it. There is going to be a little frustration as you figure out how to ""rub one out"" or ""take care of business"" moving forward. It truly is not the same sensation, as your foreskin would have acted like a pseudo stroker of sorts you are no longer going to have that barrier in place.

It will take time for the sensitivity to go away. It took about 6 months for me before it was not as noticeable when getting dressed.

If you have any questions feel free to ask. I honestly wish there was more discussion about this allowed in the forums, but sadly there are people that are more than a little zealous about it.",2025-04-14 20:45:03,5,Nocturnes_echo,funny

mo8y4lj,1k4bq7z,reddit,"Halloween 2005, I was 10 and one of our neighbors sat a scarecrow with a pumpkin head out in a swing in their front yard for the entire month of October. We passed by it every day on the way to school and I just got so used to seeing it.

Well fast forward to Halloween night and we’re all out trick or treating and we walk up to that house and the guy had moved the scarecrow to a chair on his porch. I think nothing of it and we all walk up and knock on the door. Well to my fucking horror the scarecrow fucking STANDS UP and YOWLS at us. My ass leaped off the porch and sprinted back to the road I was so scared. He had obviously removed the scarecrow completely and dressed up as it and had been scaring kids all night. I was traumatized for years.

Looking back it’s fucking genius, I want to do this exact thing once I move into the burbs, if I can fucking afford it…",2025-04-21 12:46:26,632,FriskyFritos,funny
mo8teec,1k4bq7z,reddit,"A few years ago, I made a [Halloween costume](https://ibb.co/Y7WYbMG2).  For the costume, I stood on 3' tall stilts, with big black robes, and made a huge mask that extended 2 feet above my head.  I also fitted grabber assist tools under monster gloves, so I could control these hands that were 3 feet longer.  When I stood still, people assumed I was a decoration, an 11-foot-tall statue.

As people walked toward the house up the driveway, I remained still. After people had received their candy at the door, I'd lean in and tap them on the shoulder.  So many people turned around and then fled in terror. I only traumatized children about 10 or older, and adults.

The kids were apprehensive of the situation, and didn't want to come close, so the mom walked up and was like ""don't worry, it's just a statue"", and me, an idiot, not wanting to scare the kids, raised my hand a bit and said carefully ""sorry no I'm real"".

mjswrbb,1jk2b6n,reddit,"Because there is an island in Greece called Lesbos/Lesvos. Today it is a prefecture of 3 islands, and it’s one of the main areas where feta cheese is produced. So the feta we buy at the grocery store can come from mainland Greece or Lesbos. This particular brand (Essex) comes from Lesbos. 

The island gained its name from a Greek hero, but was well known to have a largely female population, due to the aftermath of war. And then, two very popular poets (Sapphos and Alcaeus) often wrote about the female to female relationships that arose as a result… which gave birth to the term “lesbian.” 

Rainbow Grocery Store is a Worker-owned business that prides itself on selling products to support smaller farmers and businesses. When it comes to Feta, Feta from the Lesbos prefecture is more likely to be the small batch/small business feta they would want to sell. And because they are a vegetarian market in San Francisco… they know their audience. So they picked a farmer owned brand from the Island of Lesbos, who humorously claims that the milk for their cheese comes from “lesbian sheep,” because they are from lesbos… and sheep are known for sometimes exhibiting lifelong homosexual behavior in the same way people do.",2025-03-26 08:46:08,3,2McDoty,funny

I guess by that point someone with the train was alerted cause they started essentially saying the same thing, fight on the platform or get inside and stop fighting. Little Asian guy kicked this guy's ass who was prob a good foot taller and 50lbs heavier. Took his chain and got off on the platform.

Vlogers from countries like korea,usa, European countries whenever travel to developing countries like India or Phillipines or Indonesia or cambodia etc. etc. why they always end up in some shady street or slum. I'm pretty sure these developing countries have good Cities and historical places so instead of going these places why they choose slums where people from countryside stay to earn their day to day living.

For example - Phillipines which is such a nice country has nice capital, beautiful beaches,nice country side views with lot of nature to explore but almost 80% of vlogger visiting Phillipines end up in their slum.",2025-04-22 16:39:32,129,Raintree_Ice,funny

This was over two, three decades ago, so well before social media and smartphones became so ubiquitous, one of my social studies professors in college did a lot of studying of Africa and African tribes, wrote multiple books. Something to keep in mind, he was a rather pale white guy. 

Something he said he had to get used to and desensitized to rather quickly was just being stared at by everyone no matter where he went. 

And for his studies, one of the things he would want to do is take photographs of people, just living their daily lives. Obviously he could ask some people and they would always stop whatever they were doing and pose for the camera, but he also wanted more candid photos. But he knew this would be next to impossible. So he would pose and pretend he's just taking a picture of himself, like a tourist, but try to angle the camera to frame the other people at the edge of his shots.

If you get confused watching this clip of a basketball game between Mexico and Slovakia, you are not alone.

After a Slovakia player missed a pair of free throws, Mexico grabbed the rebound. All of a sudden, neither team wanted to shoot at the proper basket.

A Mexico player made an easy, uncontested layup at the *same* basket that Slovakia had just shot free throws at. (In this [FIBA video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yKnfpaqIGk&feature=youtu.be&t=1h25m10s), you can see that Mexico received two points for the layup.) Oddly, Slovakia then dribbled the ball down to the other end of the court as if that's what was supposed to happen.

Oh, this didn't happen during a pickup game. It happened during the women's 2014 FIBA U17 Basketball World Championship.

A player may occasionally shoot at the wrong hoop. However, it's pretty shocking that the opposing team and the referees went along with it like there was nothing wrong.",2025-04-01 14:21:01,20,Desperate-Hearing-55,funny

mnfw3em,1k0n1h4,reddit,"Our apartment complex has a real problem with package thieves also. Most if not all the thieves are actually pre and/or adolescent kids that don’t live in the building; they loiter by the entrances and wait for residents to come or go, then hurry in after them. Package thefts are the biggest problem with them, but they also pull fire alarms and mess up the common areas. Cops will make efforts to retreive stolen mail if they recognize the kids from the cameras (and have succeeded at times) but for whatever reason don’t want to make arrests, so the problem persists.

What boggles my mind is that our mail room has like twelve giant lockers for medium sized packages that a lot of parcels would fit into. The first year I lived here, they were used. The key would be in your mailbox. We no longer use them. The couple times I ordered something big and expensive, it was left right outside my door, but someone still could’ve stolen it.

I had a mail-order prescription stolen a couple years ago and was having mail delivered to my father’s house for a little while because of it. On at least two separate occasions that I know of, residents got so sick of it and desperate that when they caught one of the kids starting shit, they physically assaulted them.

My friend's supervisor had them both come into the office, and my friend was told that it would be a good idea if maybe she didn't bring a banana to work anymore to keep incidents like his from happening in the future. However, after a few days, my friend believed that depriving her of her banana was wrong because she wasn't even sure that the woman even had a banana allergy. She ended up going to the manager, who told her that ,""No, they couldn't legally keep her from eating a banana at work.""

mn88j35,1jzp0nx,reddit,"Hi everyone, your friendly neighborhood video editor here. Some of you are wondering if this is AI. And the simple answer is... sort of?

From what I can tell, this video is made up of 3 things. The video of the street, the footage of the goat and the patch of green.

The video of the street is real. So is the footage of the goat. However, the goat is a composite. Special effects, if you will. Someone cut the goat out from another footage of the goat and pasted it onto the wire. The grass may or may not be a composite. What it has is edited. You can see for a few frames while the goat is eating that the grass has shadows. Given the way the light is shining, that shadow is impossible. So that shadow was edited in.

Now, you might be wondering why I have not yet mentioned AI. That's because the part that is AI isn't what you would commonly assume to be AI these days. It's called ""upscaling"". The street video is upscaled - meaning it was taken at a low resolution, then using software, the resolution increase - which gives the same artifacting as generative AI. Upscaling has existed for a longer time than generative AI, but is basically the same interpolation method, so it has the same problems.

TLDR: SFX grass, composite goat, and upscaled street.

Low resolution should always be a red flag for SFX instead of gen AI, because SFX on low resolution stuff is easier to do.",2025-04-15 13:15:16,8,benderboyboy,funny

mn896x8,1jzp0nx,reddit,"Yep this is AI generated. The camera quality of smartphones has improved a lot. It shouldn't be like this although repeated sharing and heavy compression can make it look like this. 

However, another thing to know is that AI videos have smoother textures and by adding some noise, compression or lowering the bit rate, it can mimic a low quality video that can be hard to breakdown. 

Videos that look like this in today's age should be taken with a grain of salt. Cameras have way better quality nowadays and since it can zoom without losing much quality means it should have been a way better video in terms of quality but it's not.

But what my parents failed to do was simply to reach me how to correctly swallow pills. They simply expected me to just do it and made no atempt to figure out why I was have trouble. 

I also never took pills against headaches and rather suffered for ours.

Now I have no trouble at all, since I slowly decided that pills are better then headaches and even take some supplements every day.

mjxpu4j,1jkrhkb,reddit,"I'm standing here shivering, soaked and freezing to the bone as icy water drips from my hair down my back, each droplet another reminder of how little dignity I have left. Just moments ago, an elderly woman, someone who could have been my grandmother, pointed her hose at me and sprayed relentlessly, her eyes filled with contempt and judgment. People passing by laughed, capturing videos and mocking my misery as if my humiliation were entertainment. No one bothered to ask why I'm here, how I got here, or if I even want to be here. They just laugh.

Nobody chooses this life, certainly not me. I was promised a better life, tricked by people I trusted, and trafficked far from my home. Every night, I’m forced onto these cold, unforgiving streets, trapped in an endless cycle of exploitation, fear, and shame. I hate every moment, every touch, every humiliation I endure just to survive. The dreams I once had have long been extinguished, replaced by the harsh reality that my life isn’t my own. I'm invisible, disposable, and utterly alone.

Yet today, it feels even worse. Today, an old lady sprays me with freezing water, and somehow my pain is funny. To them, I'm less than human, deserving ridicule rather than compassion. As their laughter echoes in my ears, I'm reminded that society sees me not as a victim, but as entertainment. All I want is escape, relief, a moment to feel human again, but instead, I stand soaked and degraded, praying silently for the nightmare to end.",2025-03-27 01:00:43,-30,Able_Breadfruit_8942,funny

mmy7fzf,1jycnz8,reddit,"I was at the airport once with some buddies to pick up another friend who was arriving. I was pretty young, around 19, and we were just goofing around while waiting for our friend to collect his bags. 

Earlier, I had spotted some courtesy wheelchairs, and I thought it would be fun to take one and see what it's like to use. I had been wheeling around in it for about an hour, and since we'd been waiting on the bags for a while, I'd pretty much forgotten that I was still sitting in a wheelchair. 

That's when Jason, clearly bored and tired of waiting for a stationary carousel to come to life, decided to lighten the mood a little. 

In the middle of a crowd of hundreds of people silently watching the equivalent of a kettle waiting to boil, Jason approaches me. 

Somehow, despite the envelopment of the crowd, we find ourselves alone in a bit of a clearing such that people all around us turn to see him, right hand outstretched, palm against my forehead, left hand pointed at the heavens, and he exclaims,

""In the name of Christ Jesus, be healed!""

I immediately wheeled away into the bathroom and ditched the wheelchair. I wish I would have stood up and played along but I was definitely way too embarrassed to even consider it at the time. I'm still super glad it happened, lol.",2025-04-13 20:05:07,3,Boboar,funny

mklvl42,1jnqaoz,reddit,"Getting sprayed by a skunk has gotta be such a traumatic experience for a dog. 

I see a funny looking cat in the yard. I wanna make friends and play - and the fucker unleashes a nose melting stink that leaves me paralyzed. 

All I wanna do is run back inside, and get some love and sleep this one off. But my family doesn't want to go anywhere near me. And they're not letting me in. 

Finally, the big man comes out. He'll understand. But no. He looks upset and has bucket. And then the guy gives me a bath outside with the hose. A bath! In November (don't ask me how the dog knows that). Water is cold. It sucks. 

Finally, it's time to go back in the house... but no. It's the garage! I gotta spend night in the garage. I cry and howl, until one of the young dudes let you in. Family doesn't run away, but the pets are minimal. I sleep alone that night. But at least it's warm and not the damn garage. 

Anyway, things are back to normal now. That was not a fun experience... HEY! A funny looking cat is in the yard! Let's play! ",2025-03-31 00:18:21,282,KokonutMonkey,funny

mmvview,1jy4fys,reddit,"the reason she was never awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry had nothing to do with her gender, it was all related to how the rules for a before1974 were applied.

\[QUOTE\]

Watson suggested that Franklin would have ideally been awarded a [Nobel Prize in Chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry), along with Wilkins, but it was not possible. The pre-1974 rule dictated that a Nobel Prize could not be awarded posthumously unless the nomination had been made for a then-alive candidate before 1 February of the award. Franklin died a few years before 1962 when the discovery of the structure of DNA was recognised by the Nobel Committee.

I ate wings occasionally when my local bar had them for 25cent each. They weren’t making money on the wings. It was just to get us in there drinking on a Wednesday. But we could eat for less than $10 and we were going to pay for that beer anyway right?

I will eat them when they’re cheap. Or when they’re offered. But I won’t order them for myself. 

I was visiting family and offered to pay for dinner. They all wanted wings. Apparently this place had great wings. I paid $2-3 each and was not impressed in the slightest. It’s cheap crappy meat that for some reason is in demand. 

Prepare your pitchforks….id rather have some good boneless wings from chicken breast than chicken wings. The meat isn’t tough and stringy and I dont have to make a giant mess.

mlwqe2g,1jt21mg,reddit,"I get that the real answer may mot have been the intent of the post, but it has to do with uneven pollination. A strawberry is actually not a proper berry, but rather achene, or cluster fruit. With each seed resulting from individual pollination of a pistil. If some of the pistils are not pollinated the ovary does not swell and can result in uneven swelling of the fruit. You can actually use this fact to (in controlled environment) shape strawberries into specific shapes. Or in uncontrolled environments you can use wax to cover some of the pistils to prevent their pollination and create oddly shaped berries that way… however most oddly shaped strawbs just result from low populations of pollinators",2025-04-07 18:57:01,2,maddcatone,funny

Dynamic Warm-up
General Mobility
Preparation:
The Marine will stand with their feet together and arms at their sides.
Execution:
The Marine will hop to their feet outside of hip width and cross their left hand over their right. They will return to the starting position and hop again to outside of hip width, but this time will cross their right hand over the left.
Common Mistakes: - Bending the elbows
- Not alternating which arm crosses in front

So then we start doing half jacks and after only 4 of them and I hear a loud scream of agony in the row in front of me. I look over and the guy screaming falls to his knees and grabs his shoulder. The drill sergeant runs over to him and I see them walk away. Turns out dude actually got injured and had to go to the hospital.

Even if you’re someone who thinks this is “cute,” please don’t support breeders who do this. Brachycephalic breeds like this suffer with respiratory problems, eye issues, skin problems, and dental problems. They usually can’t even breed or give birth naturally. If you’re the type of person who’s absolutely dead set on having a dog with a squished face despite the fact that they have miserable medical problems, adopt don’t shop.

The strangulation was likely done afterward to mislead us.

About 5 min of them being behaved and just taking food later, one reashed his head in and bit her arm just in front of her elbow pulling her almost out the car... In a split second I didn't know what to do, I adore animals but seing her arm being violently pulled so hard her body was going out the window I reached up and punched the camel in the face... It dropped her arm and was unhurt, casually backing off to eat food dropped on the floor

We spent 3 hours in hospital having her arm X-rayed and thankfully nothing was broken, she did have a sling on and the most insaine bruising all up her arm and even by her shoulder I had ever seen that took a month to go

The lesson I took from this and one I've never forgotten, read the signs and check before you act... Also don't ever mess with camels

1. Will greasing the pole keep squirrels away?

While greasing the pole might seem like a quick fix, it’s not recommended. Substances like Vaseline, WD-40, or other greases can harm birds if they come into contact with it, impairing their feathers’ insulation and waterproofing. It’s better to use methods that are safe for birds and other wildlife.

I work in water quality in the U.K and unless there's been an incident or you live in particular challenging area on the network, your water quality is so above the regulatory standard its silly. You may not like the taste but 99 percent of the time there is zero wrong with it. It should be a deciding factor when purchasing property also and is very often overlooked. If you're wealthy and want to move to the country and live your retirement away from people thats absolutely fine but chances are something on the network will go wrong at somepoint. In 2025 there's just no time or resources to go round replacing everything like clockwork it isn't reality and never will be.

mne59mj,1jzsye3,reddit,"I know this comment will be lost at the bottom somewhere, but in my view it's really fucking simple. Don't listen to idiots online, or pseudo-experts that are just looking to sell suspect pharmaceuticals. 

Look at diets prior to 1970's or so in various places in the world. This was before we had a global health crisis regarding diet. Not all of the food or lifestyle choices are superior (we know a lot more now) but fundamentally don't consume large quantities of sugars, saturated fats, eat primary natural protein and vegetables that aren't smothered in dressings/sugar. There seems to be a lot of agreement around the notion that an ideal diet is somewhat based off your race/geographic origin. Also avoid having a diet that is largely grain based, for obvious reasons (cereals etc). 

I won't comment on the presence of hormones or pesticides in foods as this is pretty location based and many people don't have control over this. If you can, grow your own veg, or buy from a local grower/farm that uses less aggressive pesticides. If you can't, well you're in the same boat as most other people. Maybe buy a water filter to make yourself feel better.",2025-04-16 11:42:23,0,JennBones,funny

mnrt3h6,1k26w5u,reddit,"I was poor growing up.  My family didn't have much money to buy workout equipment.  At about 14, as a freshman in high school, I was an athlete in football and wrestling.

I wanted to have workout equipment at home, so I found a garbage pile weight bench and recovered the bench with towels and duct tape.  I made weights from used milk jugs filled with water, attached with wire hangers to a 2"" dowel as my bar.

I also made a pull-up bar above the stairs, going into our basement.  Again using 2"" dowel (same as what some people use to hang clothes in a closet), with closet rod hangers to hold to each wall.  This worked pretty well when I was 140lbs...

When I got to about 160 lbs, the closet rod wall hangers ripped out of the wall (screwed into studs, but only using maybe 1.5"" screws).  Thankfully, the failure was slow enough for me to get my balance and not fall down the stairs.  I found two 1'x1'  pieces of plywood and made backers for the wall hangers.  Seemed to work without issue.

When I got to 180 lbs, the dowel broke and I fell down the stairs.  I'm so glad 16-year-olds are made of mostly rubber and bounce well.",2025-04-18 15:19:42,9,bodhiseppuku,funny

mkuvxi8,1jovcek,reddit,"Ayo, and if everyone is unconcious for the entire duration of it, the airlines can pack the humans in there like sardines, just straight up tight bunkbeds, 5-8 bodies stacked ontop of eachother, making flying cheaper and greener because you can cut the amount of flights in half. Luggage can be puzzled in the layout for most efficient stacking.

Airport security staff can be cut dramatically as well, just pass em through the conveyer belt x-ray scan to check for rectal bombs. Dont need tons of security staff if everyone in the airport is a limp body. All the shops in the airport can be demolished for more gates or hostel type accommodations. Shuttle services take everyone to their booked hotel, or to to airport pod hostel in case it's not booked with the ticket.

(disclaimers)

Before you receive propofol, tell your gate agent about all your medical conditions and allergies. Also make sure your gate agent knows if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. In some cases, you may not be able to use propofol.

The FDA cautions: recommends against using propofol if you are allergic to eggs, egg products, soybeans, or soy products.

  
To make sure this medicine is safe for you, tell your gate agent if you have:

* epilepsy or other seizure disorder; or
* high cholesterol or triglycerides (a type of fat in the blood); or
* liver or kidney disease.

Tell your gate agent right away if you have:

* a light-headed feeling (like you might pass out) even after feeling awake;
* weak or shallow breathing; or
* severe pain or discomfort where the injection is given.

Common propofol side effects may include:

* mild itching or rash;
* fast or slow heart rate; or
* slight burning or stinging around the IV needle.

There is a gentleman who comes by every now and then, respectfully at around 5pm, he typically has a different older woman from the church with him each time but he shares whatever the ‘scripture of the day’ is with me and engages in a respectful and open minded discussion. He tells me his interpretation, I tell him mine and we have a good conversation. 

Example: he shared something about how the righteous/faithful will live forever, I can’t remember the specific quote. He believed it in the literal sense, i.e. you get to come back and be immortal at some point. I explained that I felt it meant that by being a good person the memory of you in your loved ones and those loved you’ve effected will make you live on and that’s a reason to be good(I think I’d just watched Coco lol) but he sat with me and chatted about it for a while without being pushy, without asking me to come to any event.

Keep doing this in remembrance of me.” This means Jesus has sent his followers to keep honoring his death by handing and passing a peace of bread representing his body. It isn’t really a celebration of Jesus’s death but honoring his legacy and appreciating how he helped the people in the earth. It’s according to them that it’s the most important day for them.

Normally in many buildings and institutions, you don't put a room number for restroom signs, however, from an internal and maintenance perspective, it helps us locate these restrooms in the case someone needs to request a service to repair or clean. 

Albeit, if there are no signage standards in place, someone will just place the room number anywhere. 

On top of that, I don't believe for restrooms, the number has to be raised for accessibility purposes (only the icon and the text referring to what type of room), nor does it have to be translated in braille. The braille does read ""103 Men"" however it falls short in saying Restroom. (This only refers to the state of Florida in the United States)

mmlwp2d,1jwse8v,reddit,"Funny, I’m currently reading Simon Sinek’s book « Start with why » which takes Southwest as an example of a company that people love because it has a company culture centered around their mission statement and not around selling stuff.

Edit: Private equity firms buy companies and enact price cutting strategies to extract as much wealth from them as possible then cash out and move onto their next victim.

It really is a race to the bottom and private equity companies own [20% of the economy up from 4% from the year 2000](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/10/private-equity-publicly-traded-companies/675788/) with ownership growing 5 times faster than the economy overall. It's another aspect of growing wealth inequality and market consolidation.

Edit 2: Elliot seeks to increase profits in the company to the benefit of shareholders but doesn't have a majority stake in the company that would be required for the private equity strategy that I mentioned. This case has more to do with the profit motive and stock market's seeking of year over year profit growth rather than private equity. 

Basically the system is actually working as intended in this case, it just doesn't benefit consumers.",2025-04-11 15:59:50,113,MisterMittens64,funny

Imagine how terrified I was, when getting off the bus after kindergarten at 4 years old, to have a stranger waiting for me at the bus stop, calling me by name, telling me he was my daddy. ""You're not my daddy!""

I started to cry, and reached for the bus driver for help. Fortunately, small town and all, in between the morning and afternoon bus rides, my bus driver was also the town's barber, and he was the one who shaved me dad's face, and game him a haircut, so he could vouch for my ""new dad"". 😅",2025-04-05 20:44:48,3,NecroJoe,funny

mot5on6,1k4tzha,reddit,"So, a while back, I started managing some folks in their 20s and noticed that some important stuff just wasn't getting done. Turns out, a few of them were seriously struggling to use the phone or chat with strangers. I couldn't wrap my head around it. I ended up having a talk with HR, and they told me this was becoming pretty common—like, a whole generation that prefers texting over talking. 

I’d say things like, “Just give Billy a call at that company and ask him about the issue. If it sounds good, just go for it.” 

Days later, when everything hit the fan, I'd be like, “How did this happen!? What did Billy say when you called him!?” 

And I’d just get a blank stare. They’d respond with something like, “Wait, you wanted me to actually call Billy? Like, on the phone? Oh wow, no, I don’t really do that.” 

And I would totally lose my mind over it. I’ve gotten a bit better at accepting it now, but it's still crazy to me that so many people can't communicate in a way that way. I'm not even that old really. Nearly 40. A few of these kids got both barrels from me initially, which made things worse. After it was explained to me, I found I could work around it more easily.",2025-04-24 16:02:29,1,Funny-Presence4228,funny

I LOVE dogs, and like pits just fine, although ive known some overly exciteable ones. We talked about the statistics and she got really defensive, ""pitbull isnt even an actual breed!"" And all that jazz. I didnt push it.

A couple weeks later, it attacked her 19 y/o daughter's foot. Shoe destroyed and some minor foot damage. She sent the dog back. Couple months after that she adopted a stray that showed up at her house, older 35 lb dog. Then she adopted two puppy siblings rott/pit mixes a few months later. The female siblings killed the older dog when it was about 8 months old. Ripped its throat out. She didn't get another dog, tho, but kept the siblings.

They are pointing out that the playground has two sections.

One for young children aged 2 to 5 and one for older children aged 5 to 12.

One is designed to be extra safe for toddlers and likely has toys that larger kids would break.

The other has more engaging and exciting activities for older children but would be very dangerous for toddlers.

mkyzop8,1jp7au6,reddit,"CSA has two separate guidelines for playground equipment. This is stating that it fits both. For example, a smaller child cannot use a sliding (fireman) pole, but a bigger child can. So this playground likely doesn't have one. A larger child can't fit in some of the smaller spaces, so this likely doesn't have them. 

The sixth year of a child's life is considered the ""transitional"" year, so it is mentioned both times.

Playgrounds are inspected after installation and sometimes given an approval. However, this sign was likely designed by an engineer who doesn't know how to communicate with the public. 

Read more about CSA Z614:20. It's a good read; I recommend it for this weekend.

moiml7o,1k5i7jr,reddit,"A moth goes into a podiatrist's office, the podiatrist says. What's the problem?


The moth says, where do I begin with my problems? Every day I go to work for Gregory Vasilovich, and all day long I toil. But what is my work? I am a bureaucrat, and so every day I joylessly move papers from one place to another and then back again. I no longer know what it is that I actually do, and I don't even know if Gregory Vasilovich knows. He only knows that he has power over me, and this seems to bring him much happiness. And where is my happiness? It is when I awake in the morning and I do not know who I am. In that single moment, I am happy. In that single moment before, the memory of who I am strikes me like a cane and I take to the streets and walk in a malaise here and then there and then here again. Then it is time for work. Others stop asking me what I do for a living long ago. For they know I will have no answer, and will fix my empty eyes upon them, and they fear my melancholia might prove so deep as to be contagious. Sometimes in the dark and the deepest dark of night I awaken my bed and I turn to my right and with horror I see some old lady lying on my arm. An old lady that I once loved, Doc, and whose flesh I once found splendor and now see only decay. An old lady who insults me by her very existence. One stock when I was young I flew into a spider web and was trapped and in my panic I smashed my wings till the dust flew from them but it did not free me and only alerted the spider. The spider moved toward me and I became still and the spider stopped. I had heard many stories from my elders about spiders, about how they would sink their fangs into your cephalothorax and you would be paralyzed but aware as the spiders slowly devoured you. So I remained as still as possible, but when the spider again began moving toward me, I smashed my wing again into my cage of silk, and this time it worked. I cut into the web and freed myself and flew skyward. I was free and filled with joy. But this joy soon turned to horror. I looked down and saw that in my escape I had taken with me a single strand of silk, and at the end of the strand was the spider who was scrambling upward toward me. Was I to die high in the sky where no spider should be? I flew this way, then that. Finally I freed myself from the strand and watched as it floated earthward with the spider. But days later, a strange feeling descended upon my soul Doc. I began to feel that my life was that single strand of silk with a deadly spider racing up it and toward me. And I felt that I had already been bitten by his venomous fangs, and I was living in a state of paralysis as life devoured me whole. My daughter Alexandria fell to the cold of last winter. The cold took her, as it did many of us. And so my family mourned. And I placed on my countenance the look of grief, Doc. But it was a masquerade. I felt no grief for my dead daughter, but only envy. And so I have one child now, a boy whose name is Stefan Mikhailovich Smakovnakov. And I tell you now, doc, with great and deep shame, the terrible truth: I no longer love him. When I look into his eyes, all I see is the same cowardice that I see when I catch a glimpse of my own eyes in a mirror. It is this cowardice that keeps me living Doc, that keeps me moving from place to place, saying hello and goodbye, eating though hunger as long left me, walking without destination, and at night, lying beside the strange old lady in this burlesque of a life I endure. If only the cowardice would leave for the time needed to reach over and pick up the cocked and loaded pistol that lies on my bedside table, and I might finally end this facade once and for all. But alas, the cowardice takes no breaks. It is what defines me. It is what frames my life. It is what I am, and yet I cannot resign myself to my own life. Instead with despair as my constant companion, as I walk here and then there, without dreams, without hope and without love.


Moth, says the podiatrist. Your tale has moved me and it is clear you need help. But it is help I cannot provide. You must see your psychiatrist and tell him of your troubles. Why on Earth did you come to my office?

He is summoned in to his doctor’s office, and asked to sit down

He refuses, suggesting “He prefers to remain standing”, so the doctor asks “What has brought you in here to see me today then?”

The man says, “It’s my bottom Doc”

Doc - “What seems to be the problem?”

Patient - “You’re not going to believe this…but I was sexually assaulted by an elephant last night!!”

Doc - exasperated…”Wow, how on earth…no matter, you had better show me”

Doc gestures towards examination bed, and asks the patient to lie down. Again, he refuses sighting his inability to do so, due to the excruciating pain he is suffering.

Doc - “Ok, just drop your trousers (pants) and your pants (underwear), so I can have a look?”

As the patient does so…

Doc asks - “So am I understanding correctly…that you were R A P E D by this elephant?”

Patient nods unable to meet the Doc’s eyes, and quietly mentions “amongst other atrocities!!”

By this time the patient has exposed the affected area

The Doc is dumbfounded!! He had never seen trauma the like… 

Doc - “Poor you, that does indeed look very painful, and you’re certainly going to need some sort of surgery, and a good dose of antibiotics!!

Doc - “I’m sorry to ask…but having seen a few nature documentary’s with elephants in them, I am somewhat aware of the magnitude of their manhood, and although this is no doubt a terrible injury, it looks like even more damage has been caused than even an elephant’s massive member might be responsible for?”
