1jyul4n,reddit,Witnessing a Tragedy in Da Nang – A Wake-Up Call,"This morning around 10 AM in Da Nang, I took a short break from my online work to pick up some cigarettes and visit a pharmacy. Everything was normal, routine even. I got what I needed, called a Grab motorbike, and headed back to my hotel.

On the way back, I witnessed something I’ll never forget.

A woman was lying in the middle of the street, covered in blood, her motorbike destroyed beside her. She had just been hit by a car. Her eyes were still open, but she was clearly gone. And what shook me to my core wasn’t just the accident, it was the man who hit her. He stood there, smiling at the police, as if he had just bumped into a lamppost. No remorse. No horror. Just... indifference.

People were standing around filming. Taking photos. Some medical help had arrived, but it was already too late. A woman lost her life in the middle of a busy road, and it felt like the world just kept turning. She might have been a mother. A wife. Heading to work to support her family. Now she’s gone. Just like that. A family shattered in an instant, and for what?

I’ve lived and driven in several countries. I spent three years riding a motorbike in Thailand without a license. I’ve been hit before, got up, and kept going. I’ve driven through chaos in cities like Istanbul, experienced sketchy areas in Mexico and Manila, but nothing, and I mean nothing, has made me feel as unsafe as the roads here in Vietnam.

This place has an entirely different level of danger. Children, literal 10-year-olds, are driving scooters. No turn signals. No awareness. People just honk and hope you understand what they’re about to do. You constantly feel like your life depends on guessing right. I’ve never been so on edge in traffic before.

And the worst part? There’s a systemic indifference. That man who took a life today is probably back home with his family right now, having dinner, sleeping soundly, while another family is grieving the unimaginable. And he smiled.

He smiled.

To any tourist or expat reading this: This is not like Thailand or other Southeast Asian countries. I wish someone had told me how different it would be. The driving culture here isn’t just chaotic, it’s dangerous. It feels lawless. And the terrifying truth is, if something happens to you, the odds of accountability are slim, especially if you're a foreigner.

This isn’t an attack on Vietnamese people as individuals. I’ve met good, kind-hearted souls here. But there is a deeply troubling cultural disconnect when it comes to road safety, personal responsibility, and even basic modern infrastructure. I’ve had people stare in awe at my metal Revolut card like it was some kind of alien artifact. It's 2025. How is this still a reality?

A friend once made a harsh comparison about the driving mentality here. At the time, I thought he was being ignorant and offensive. But today, after what I saw, I understand what he meant. It’s not about race or people, it’s about mindset. A mindset where human life feels disturbingly disposable.

This is my last visit to Vietnam. I’ve seen a lot in my travels, violence, crime, poverty. But I’ve never experienced such a deep-rooted lack of empathy and awareness on the roads as I have here. Today shook me to the core.

To the woman who lost her life today: I didn’t know you, but I’m so, so sorry. You deserved better.

To everyone else: Don’t take your safety for granted. This isn’t just about traffic, it’s about humanity.",2025-04-14 09:19:18,VietNam,VietNam,news,News,[],0,1603,479,,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1jyul4n/witnessing_a_tragedy_in_da_nang_a_wakeup_call/,ofella3
1jq53qs,reddit,90% Tariff is Fake Math,"If you missed it earlier, Trump has claimed that Vietnam has 90% tariffs on American goods while simultaneously enacting a ""reciprocal"" blanket tariff of 46% on all Vietnamese goods imported to America.

All of the claimed foreign tariffs are fake and do not reflect any real implemented tariffs by any country. Vietnam does not have 90% tariffs on any American good.

The ""tariff"" numbers on the chart for every country is trade deficit divided by trade exports. [According to the Office of US Trade Representative](https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/southeast-asia-pacific/vietnam), America imports from Vietnam is $136.6 billion and exports to Vietnam is $13.1 billion. The deficit is export minus imports. (13.1-136.6)/136.6 = -90%

You can do this for every other country that America is implementing tariffs on. [For China](https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/china-mongolia-taiwan/peoples-republic-china), American exports were $143.5 billion while Chinese imports were $438.9 billion. (143.5 - 438.9) / 438.9 = -67%, matching the claims. Any country that America somehow had a trade surplus with was slapped with a 10% tariff floor.

The numbers claimed by Trump are not reflective of actual implemented tariffs by any country. Trump is insinuating that the entire trade deficit that America has with every country is because of tariffs or currency manipulation, when that is not the case. The vast majority of the countries that Trump has enacted tarrifs on are simply poorer and smaller and whose citizens cannot consume as frivolously as America does. Many of these countries don't have any or low tariffs due to free trade deals. In the case of Ecuador, their national currency is literally the American dollar; they have no national currency to manipulate.

Please stop taking Trump's claims at face value. Do some research and critical thinking before repeating them.",2025-04-03 00:58:13,VietNam,VietNam,news,News,[],0,1404,267,,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1jq53qs/90_tariff_is_fake_math/,jcow77

1k6kfm8,reddit,I used to hate being Vietnamese – now I’m finally proud.,"Sorry if this isn’t the right place, but I didn’t know where else to post this.

I used to hate being Vietnamese when I was younger.
I was born and raised in Germany, and I was the only Asian kid in my kindergarten and school. Most kids were white, and that made me feel like I didn’t belong.

I got bullied a lot — racist jokes, stereotypes, constant comments like:
“Do you eat dog?”
“You guys eat horse penises, right?”
They’d make fun of my eyes. Every time I brought food from home, I’d hear:
“That’s disgusting.”
“Why does it smell like that?”
(And guess what — they love that food now.)

I was so embarrassed by my culture that I wished I could just be white — to feel “normal.”
I never learned much about Vietnamese culture growing up, because part of me wanted to avoid it.

But after leaving school and getting out of that toxic environment, I started to reconnect.
I started to learn about Vietnam — the history, the food, the language, the people — and for the first time, I started feeling pride.

Last week, I flew to Vietnam for the first time in years.
When the plane landed, I started crying. I couldn’t help it.
It felt like coming home to something I had been missing my whole life.

Vietnam, I love you.
I love your kind, hardworking people.
I love your resilience, your beauty, your strength.
I’m sorry I once hated you.

No one is asking for perfect pronunciation and accent marks. But how difficult is it to copy four letters: b…a… n… h… and accept that other languages exist? You would think we were asking rocket science from these people especially those who insist they’re correct or who continue to misspell even when the word is in front of them.

When i read food reviews and travel guides people are always recommending “the best bahn mi:)” and the more popular it gets the more people find out about it and spread their misspelling, even other asian people. It’s literally four letters long, i get that the “nh” spelling is not common in english so it’s a LITTLE harder for them but they shouldn’t be surprised other languages exist and also the same people have no trouble spelling Dostoyevsky. And even worse for french when they literally gave us this word due to their colonization and now they can’t even spell our version right 🥲

They don’t even need to spell it with the accents like bánh mì or even pronounce it correctly. but at LEAST just arrange the four letters in order like sometimes it is even already written out in front of them, and they still write BAHNMI:) I’m so annoyed because it’s the bare minimum they could do if they wanted to engage with the culture and consume the food, it’s simply about respecting the language and history, and also just the fact that soon it will probably become acceptable to misspell it because so many people are doing it 😐",2025-04-14 22:28:13,VietNam,VietNam,news,News,[],0,470,285,,0.87,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1jzbwph/im_so_sick_and_tired_of_bahn_mi/,Muted_Summer_2231

1k5jty5,reddit,U.S. Tells Its Diplomats in Vietnam to Avoid War Anniversary Event,"The reversal adds another Trump administration blow to decades of reconciliation efforts.

The Trump administration has told its senior diplomats in Vietnam not to take part in events marking the 50th anniversary of the end of the war.

Four U.S. officials who insisted on anonymity to describe sensitive diplomatic decision-making said that Washington had recently directed senior diplomats — including Marc Knapper, the U.S. ambassador to Vietnam — to stay away from activities tied to the anniversary on April 30.

That includes a hotel reception on April 29 with senior government leaders and an elaborate parade the next day — gatherings hosted by Vietnam in Ho Chi Minh City, also known as Saigon, where the war ended with South Vietnam’s surrender.

Veterans returning to Vietnam have also been told they’re on their own, for public discussions they organize on war and reconciliation, and anniversary events. For many, it amounts to a sudden reversal after months of anticipation.

“I really don’t understand it,” said John Terzano, a founder of the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation who served two tours in Vietnam and has attended anniversary events for decades. “As a person who has dedicated his life to reconciliation and marveled at how it’s grown over the last 20 years or so, this is really a missed opportunity.”

“It really doesn’t require anything of the United States to just stand there,” Mr. Terzano added, in an interview after landing in Hanoi. “This is all ceremonial stuff — that’s what makes it sound crazy and disappointing.”

State Department and embassy officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

A half-dozen people with knowledge of the directive said it was not clear where it originated or why it had been issued.

April 30 is the 100th day of Mr. Trump’s second term. Some U.S. officials speculated that a Trump appointee or a State Department leader feared drawing attention away from that milestone with events that might highlight America’s defeat in a war that Mr. Trump managed to avoid.

In 1968, a year when 296,406 Americans were drafted into military service, Mr. Trump received a diagnosis of bone spurs in his heels that led to a medical exemption.

Regardless of the reasoning for Washington’s retreat from the 50th-anniversary events, it adds another blow to decades of painstaking diplomacy by Republican and Democratic administrations, which had sought to both heal the war’s wounds and build a strategic partnership for countering China.

Mr. Trump had already frozen U.S.A.I.D. money allocated for addressing the legacy of the war. Even after officials restored some of it, many programs — for finding missing soldiers and demining old battlefields, for example — are still struggling with layoffs and uncertainty.
The foundation of bilateral relations, built by veterans from both sides, has essentially been weakened.

It was their emotional and physical hard work, with visits and civil society partnerships in Vietnam, that had persuaded former enemy governments to work through complicated issues like unexploded ordnance, soldiers missing in action and the toxic legacy of Agent Orange and other American herbicides.
The momentum of postwar bonding led in 2023 to a new level of strategic partnership between the two nations. And the work had been on track to expand, until Mr. Trump’s approach to the world, pugilistic and allergic to the acknowledgment of errors, strained relations.

“It’s taken decades to build the current level of mutual trust and cooperation between the United States and Vietnam,” said George Black, the author of “The Long Reckoning,” a study of U.S.-Vietnam relations after the war. “And the whole process has been underpinned by our willingness to deal with the worst humanitarian legacies.”

Mr. Knapper, the son of a Vietnam veteran who was sworn in as the U.S. ambassador in 2022, had embraced his diplomatic mission. As of a few weeks ago, he had been expected to attend the main anniversary events on April 29 and 30 alongside delegations from other countries, including Australia and the Netherlands.

He has often led ceremonies in which the United States gave artifacts from the war back to Vietnamese military families, and repatriated the remains of what were believed to be missing Americans.
In an essay for this month’s Foreign Service Journal, he wrote about traveling to Vietnam with his father and son in 2004, describing the trip as “a clear reminder of the sacrifices on both sides and the enduring importance of reconciliation.”

“As ambassador,” he added, “I believe that to truly strengthen our ties, we must engage deeply and directly with the people and leaders of Vietnam.”

With that goal in mind, before Mr. Trump took office, the two countries had planned to show off their hard-earned bond in a new exhibit at the War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City.

The museum, Vietnam’s most visited cultural institution, chronicles American war atrocities. Under the plan, one of its wings was to be transformed: Design blueprints aimed for a lively introduction to the activists and officials who helped forge a model of postwar recovery.
Organizers had hoped the ambitious exhibit would open this month, or at least by July 11, the 30th anniversary of the restoration of American diplomatic relations with Vietnam.

But it’s now in limbo. The project was funded by U.S.A.I.D., while the United States Institute of Peace managed the details. The Trump administration has dismantled both agencies.

“Reconciliation is in our economic, geopolitical and moral interest,” said Andrew Wells-Dang, a senior program officer at the peace institute who oversaw the museum project until he was fired a few weeks ago.

“U.S. government and nongovernmental partners alike,” he added, “are reeling from the effects of the new administration’s actions, leaving our Vietnamese colleagues distraught and confused.”

Vietnamese officials did not respond to requests for comment about the anniversary. But they have repeatedly nudged the United States toward responsibility for the war’s lingering impact, with some success. After high-level discussions, the Defense Department recently restored money it had set aside for war legacy issues, even though its administrative partner, U.S.A.I.D., is gone.

As a result, the cleanup process for contamination from Agent Orange at the Bien Hoa air base has been revived, at least for this year.

Mr. Trump’s tariffs, however, have added another layer of vexation. With a rate set at 46 percent for Vietnam — above nearly every other country — some U.S. officials thought Vietnam might disinvite diplomats to the anniversary events.

That did not happen. The tariffs are now paused, and the two countries are locked in negotiations, with Vietnam seeking a reprieve and U.S. officials pushing Hanoi to decouple from China.

Vietnam has often made clear that it would like to find room for its fierce independence and pursuit of prosperity.

The Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, recently visited Hanoi. The anniversary events could have provided a way for the United States and Vietnam to show that, despite a brutal war, they are still close strategic partners.

Instead, Vietnam is left to wonder how much it will now be asked to endure from its former adversary.

Mr. Terzano said that in a proud nation that cares deeply about symbolism, the U.S. decision to avoid the events looks “petty and nonsensical.”

He argued that the absence would strengthen the world’s gathering storm of doubt about America.

“You take a look at the chaos that has transpired,” he said. “Nations around the globe are all questioning: ‘Where is the U.S.? What does it mean?’”",2025-04-22 22:43:12,VietNam,VietNam,news,News,[],0,445,133,,0.97,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/world/asia/us-diplomats-vietnam-war-anniversary-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare,MotherMilks99

1jmi4r5,reddit,Don’t trust Google reviews in Vietnam,"Just a heads-up if you’re traveling here: the Vietnamese are REALLY good at digital branding.

That doesn’t mean you can’t find amazing experiences and great value—it’s actually pretty easy. But you do need to research properly. Relying on Google reviews alone isn’t enough. Use video platforms like Instagram or TikTok, check travel forums, or if possible book in person.

Even when reviews are real, they’re often manufactured. We’ve had multiple places ask us to leave a review on the spot, sometimes with the added pressure of, “If you say something bad, I’ll lose my job.” Others offer little perks like a free chocolate or discount in exchange for a 5-star rating.

Hotel photos? Often AI-enhanced—or in some cases, completely AI-generated.

Even Reddit isn’t safe. Just look up Ha Giang Loop company reviews, and you’ll see a flood of suspiciously positive comments from company shill accounts.

1k04bu3,reddit,China's Xi urges Vietnam to oppose 'bullying' as Trump mulls more tariffs,"
China's President Xi Jinping has called on Vietnam to oppose ""unilateral bullying"" to upkeep a global system of free trade - though he stopped short of naming the US.

It comes as Xi is on a so called ""charm offensive"" trip across South East Asia, which will also see him visit Malaysia and Cambodia.

Though the trip was long-planned, it has taken on heightened significance in the wake of a mounting trade war between the US and China. Vietnam was facing US tariffs of up to 46% before the Trump administration issued a 90-day pause last week.

US President Donald Trump called Xi's meeting with Vietnamese leaders a ploy to figure out how to ""screw the United States of America"".

According to state media outlet Xinhua, Xi told Vietnam's Communist Party Secretary-General To Lam to ""jointly oppose unilateral bullying"".

""We must strengthen strategic resolve... and uphold the stability of the global free trade system as well as industrial and supply chains,"" he said.
Stephen Olson, a former US trade negotiator, said Xi's comments were ""a very shrewd tactical move"".

""While Trump seems determined to blow up the trade system, Xi is positioning China as the defender of rules-based trade, while painting the US as a reckless rogue nation,"" he added.
Speaking to reporters in the Oval office on Monday, Trump said he does not ""blame"" China or Vietnam but alleged that they were focused on how to harm the US.

""That's a lovely meeting. Meeting like, trying to figure out, how do we screw the United States of America?"" said Trump.

The world's two largest economies are locked in an escalating trade battle, with the Trump administration putting tariffs of 145% on most Chinese imports earlier this month. Beijing later responded with its own 125% tariffs on American products coming into China.

On Saturday, a US customs notice revealed smartphones, computers and some other electronic devices would be excluded from the 125% tariff on goods entering the country from China.

But Trump later chimed in on social media saying there was no exemption for these products and called such reports about this notice false. Instead, he said that ""they are just moving to a different tariff 'bucket'"".

#  A 'golden opportunity' for Xi
Xi arrived in Hanoi on Monday, where he was welcomed by well wishers waving Chinese and Vietnamese flags.

He then met top Vietnamese officials including the country's Secretary-General and Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh.

Earlier on Tuesday, Xi visited the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum to take part in a wreath laying ceremony at the resting place of the former Vietnamese founder and Communist leader.

Despite Xi's visit, Vietnam will be careful to ""manage the perception that it is colluding with China against the United States, as the US is too important a partner to put aside,"" said Susannah Patton, Director of the Southeast Asia Program at the Lowy Institute think-tank.

""In many ways, China is an economic competitor as well as an economic partner for South East Asian economies,"" she added.

Xi has now left Vietnam and will arrive in Malaysia later on Tuesday. He is expected to meet the country's King, as well as its Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.

It comes as Malaysian mobile data service company U Mobile said it will roll out the country's second 5G network by using infrastructure technology from China's Huawei and ZTE.
Ms Patton expects Xi to continue portraying the US as ""a partner which is unreliable [and] protectionist"".

Meanwhile, he is likely to ""portray China in stark contrast as a partner that is there"", she added.

""Now is really a golden opportunity for China to score that narrative win. I think this is how Xi's visit to Vietnam, Cambodia and Malaysia will be seen.""",2025-04-15 21:59:39,VietNam,VietNam,news,News,[],0,329,139,,0.95,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdrgk2338dvo,MotherMilks99

I have never seen people like this.

They love life so much. I had the best service whenever I interacted with them in the streets, hotel and restaurant. They really want me to feel good.

When I'm walking in some area that are more remote, if I have an eye contact with them, they give me a big smile and say Hellooo, never asked for money. Some people wave at me just to send me positive vibes, without bad intentions.

I feel safe everywhere, even at night. When there is a language barrer, they use the translator app and make sure we understand each other.

For the first time, I don't feel like a walking wallet in a country, and I love it.

A few times when I was paying, I mistaken the 10k bill and the 100k bill, they look alike. Never tried to scam me. My change was always exact.

1k2yram,reddit,Địa đạo (2025) is incredible - Vietnam movie making at it's finest. Especially after 5 decades of Hollywood overdose of Americans in the Vietnam War,"Just came out of the theater having watched this, and words fail me utterly. The movie captures claustrophobia better than Das Boot (1981), the horrors of war better than Paths of Glory (1957), sheer bleakness of soldiers as well as 1917 (2019), and probably a pioneer war movie in showing how women play an equal role in the fights and heroics but are so so often overlooked.

Yeah, I realise there are other (some might claim propaganda) reasons for the launch of the movie, but it stands just as poignant today as it would have at any other time. The film making especially is absolutely top notch, better than most of the gimmick shit we are overdosed on by Hollywood execs for a tiny fraction of the budget. The protagonists are shown as real humans, doing mundane daily stuff in the middle of horrors, some with terrible flaws - not at all the Rambo-like portrayal we have come to see in some many others.

Hindsight is 20/20 and I was obviously too trusting and not as vigilant as I unfortunately need to be. I was distressed and just wanted to believe this stranger cared.

He dropped me at my destination and I tipped him. He asked me if I was okay, I said I just had a bad night, he offered some comforting words and went in for a hug. When he hugged me he grabbed my bottom and kissed my neck.

I’m a sexual abuse victim and it’s brought up all kinds of horrible feelings and thoughts. Idk why I’m sharing this. I just feel really sad about it. 

I suppose I’m lucky that he didn’t take me anywhere or do anything more. In future, I won’t try to go home so late at night when it’s difficult to book through the app.

1jn4i96,reddit,Any Viet Kieus married into a rich family? If so how was it like?,"Hi guys I am in a dilemma, my uncle and parents are setting me up for marriage with a girl in Vietnam. Our families known each other for a while, her grandma and my grandpa were really close when he was still alive back in Vietnam before he left for the states. My mom knew her mom growing too, due to my grandpa and her grandma close relationship. So I guess our family goes way back. My cousins from the states somehow know their family as well and when they visited Vietnam recently they stayed over at one of their houses. Supposedly her family is insanely rich and would like to send her off for marriage. Their only criteria is they have is a good person and has faith, which my uncle has vouched for me. They don't care about wealth at all. However, I just don't know how I would interact with her, we come from very different economic backgrounds. I'm middle class and she's way above that. She literally is living in a house with an elevator like wtf. I would just feel bad that would not be able to provide the life she has over there compared to the states. Has anyone here married into a wealthy family and if so how is your relationship? 

Minor update: My uncle spoke to my mom and after speaking with her mother, if everything goes smoothly and if we're compatible. She will fly us out here and told don't worry about spending anything. When we are going to visit. My mother declined because it feels awkward and I agreed as well.


Probably FINAL update on this: her mother wants me to move over there if the marriage were to happen, due to her husband being gone and she only has her daughter and her son left. My uncle say no to that and say why not marry a guy in over there and she was speechless lol. So, I guess this Crazy Asians Story has come to an end. Even though it was very short lived, I enjoyed reading the comments and people sharing their experiences. Also, I just don't see me myself living over there and I'll be all by myself and I can see their perspective as well. With her being over in the states by herself. I also brought up some points that you guys made on here as well. I was telling them that what if they use their wealth to leverage over me and abused me.

1jv07j5,reddit,How Trump tariffs could push Vietnam into the arms of China,"The move has sent shock waves through a region of US strategic importance that had respected Trump as tough on Beijing

Vietnam had tried to appease Donald Trump: tariffs on US goods were reduced; regulations were passed to allow Elon Musk’s SpaceX to launch its Starlink in the country. The prime minister, Pham Minh Chinh, even joked in January that he would happily “play golf all day long” at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home in Florida if it could “bring benefits to my country and my people”.

The strategies do not appear to have worked. Trump has inflicted an extraordinary 46% tariff on Vietnam that threatens to devastate its economic growth plans and undermine relations between the two countries. The tariff has sent shock waves through Vietnam, a manufacturing powerhouse where Trump has always been fairly popular, and across south-east Asia.

Across the region, which is highly dependent on exports, Trump is introducing similarly punishing tariffs, including in Cambodia (49%), Laos (48%), Thailand (36%), Indonesia (32%), Malaysia (24%), Brunei (24%), the Philippines (17%), and Singapore (10%).

The announcement has damaged the US’s reputation as a reliable partner in the region, said Kevin Chen an associate research fellow with the US programme at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, in Singapore. The Trump administration’s approach was “unilateral, coercive, and undermines the trading system that countries in this region prospered under”, Chen said.

South-east Asia is a strategically important region for the US, especially in light of Washington’s competition with China and tensions in the South China Sea.

Vietnam and the US had grown closer under Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, with the two countries upgrading their partnership. Trump is known to be well liked in Vietnam, where his books are translated into Vietnamese, and he has gained respect as a businessman and as a politician tough on China.

Yet relations between the US and south-east Asia have been undermined in recent months. The tariff announcement comes on top of the gutting of USAID and other foreign assistance programmes, which halted life-saving projects across the region.

America’s image has also been damaged in recent years in countries including the Muslim-majority Malaysia and Indonesia, owing to Washington’s support for Israel during its war on Gaza. US companies have been targeted with prolonged boycotts in both countries.

China is expected to try to capitalise on the chaos. Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, is due to visit Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia this month and “will likely use the opportunity to portray China as a steadfast and reliable partner in contrast to the US”, Chen said. A slew of economic agreements are expected to be signed between China and those countries by the end of his visit.

In the longer term, whether China can leverage frustration in south-east Asia is less straightforward, say analysts, especially as Beijing risks becoming embroiled in a worsening trade war with its superpower rival.

Trump has threatened China with an extra 50% tariff, which will exacerbate the economic difficulties already affecting dynamics between China and its south-east Asian neighbours.

Peter Mumford, the head of practice for south-east Asia at Eurasia Group, said the region was “grappling with a flood of low-cost Chinese goods, and that’s going to get even more complicated”. The oversupply of cheap goods, from clothing to steel, had damaged small businesses and contributed to hundreds of factories closing in Thailand.

South-east Asian leaders will seek to diversify by looking to Europe or Japan, say analysts, while also scrambling to negotiate with Trump.

It is unclear what countries such as Vietnam can offer to placate Washington. Vietnam’s trade surplus with the US has surpassed $123bn, a figure that has grown rapidly over recent years as companies moved there from China to skirt tariffs imposed by the previous Trump administration.

“Trump would likely push Vietnam to commit to purchasing significantly more American goods and services. As Vietnam has been seen as a conduit for China to bypass US tariffs, the Trump administration may also demand that Vietnam restrict transshipment of Chinese goods,” said Phan Xuan Dung, research officer of the Vietnam Studies Programme at the ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute, in Singapore.

Vietnam was doing its best to negotiate to persuade the US to reduce the tariffs, said Khang Vu, a visiting scholar in the political science department at Boston College. But, he added, the US tariffs would “damage the Vietnamese government’s goodwill toward the Trump administration”.

He said Trump’s tariffs on Vietnamese goods showed Hanoi that, despite everything Washington had said of Vietnam’s regional importance, their partnership was “dispensable”.

Countries in the region would be cautious about leaning too closely to China, already south-east Asia’s largest trading partner. In the past the US had served as a counterbalance in the region. “The major difference this time,” said Chen, “is that they will need to account for a potentially unfriendly, if not hostile United States as well as an assertive China.”",2025-04-09 07:40:39,VietNam,VietNam,news,News,[],0,170,142,,0.91,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/08/how-trump-tariffs-could-push-vietnam-into-the-arms-of-china,MotherMilks99

1jsoii5,reddit,Let's keep vietnamese pregnant women safe from their family,"I keep hearing stories of pregnancy going horribly wrong mostly because of family pressuring the woman with stupid superstitions. Yes there are stupid advice all around the world, but in Vietnam questioning those advice is a declaration of war with your family (to not say your mother in law in most cases). I've heard countless depressions due to the absurd regime their family was forcing them into, with obesity due to the obvious unbalance. I've heard babies refusing to drink their mother milk because the mother only drinks ""traditional"" herbal preparations. I've heard women suffering severe infections after delivery because they're forbidden to take shower. I've heard countless practices that sound and are outright dangerous (hot charcoal, vagina steaming, ...). Every doctor has to tell people over and over that those absurd practices are dangerous, and write it down on every paper they give you.  And lately I've heard a woman being pressured to have ""normal"" delivery despite her doctor insisting on an early C-section. The baby died of asphyxia and she eventually had a C-section to deliver a dead baby. I'm pretty sure her family is now blaming her for the miscarriage. 

With that in mind, I think it's useful to remind everybody the following obvious facts:

Doctors know what they are doing more than anybody around you. They didn't hear it from their neighbors, they learnt a century legacy of countless doctors and midwives, who have experimented and carefully observed. Midwives have touched more babies than your grandma has ever seen, they're full of good advice, and clearly underpaid for that. 

Your family and your husband's family can be literal baby killers. They will always prioritize their ego to you and your baby's health. If your husband cannot stand up against his family, don't even consider having a child with him. If your family cannot respect you, don't let them get any close to you, block them and don't let them see your baby until they apologize. 

If traditional medicine and grandma recipes were any useful, the infant mortality wouldn't have been divided by 4 during the last 50 years by the introduction of modern medicine. All traditional medicine in the world have at some point poisoned their clients with mercury and lead with the same confidence as they sell you remedies today. You could drop dead in front of their eyes, they would keep selling the same remedies telling that you would be alive if you took twice more. 

Everybody should know what is a good diet, it is displayed in every school: plenty of carbohydrates, vegetables and fruits, and reasonable amount of meat, fish or milk. The fact that your family doesn't know that shows how ignorant they are. Only restrict yourself if the doctor tells you to, don't abuse anything. One glass of milk a day will get you tons of benefits, one litter of milk will destroy your health. 

People will try everything to sell useless or even dangerous services to a young mom desperate to do the best for her baby. Vagina steaming and warmth applied on the belly will damage your vagina that is trying to heal. Your baby doesn't need 1h bath, it wants it as fast as possible. Don't pay for anything that your doctor hasn't explicitly advised. If they can, they will take more money from you than your hospital. 

The mental health of a pregnant woman / young mother is as important as the health of the baby. Eat ice-cream and anything that makes you feel happy. Even few sushis are much less harmful than a depression. The only people who should feel pressure are the family and friends who should suffer the wrath of a moody woman, not the woman who is bearing a child. 

So please everybody take care of the pregnant women around you and protect them from their family. ",2025-04-06 07:17:59,VietNam,VietNam,news,News,[],0,146,36,,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1jsoii5/lets_keep_vietnamese_pregnant_women_safe_from/,arllt89

Getting gas for motorcycle. Attendant fills up my tank. VERY quickly moves on to the next tank without getting my money yet. Therefore the amount is no longer on the screen and I didn’t have time to look up and see the amount. Dude has already filled the other person’s tank to 50k. I look at screen, give him 50k, and he gets upset. I point to screen. First tells me I owe 120k, looks shifty while doing so. I have never paid this much to fill up my bike. A dude pulls up next to me and knows English, so begins to translate. The two go back and forth for quite a while. English speaking dude tells me I owe 40k more. So essentially the attendant lowers total amount to 90k. I give him 40k more just to be done with it all. Again, this isn’t about the money.

1ju84mw,reddit,"Vietnam to buy US defence, security products to tackle trade gap","HANOI, April 8 (Reuters) - Vietnam will buy more American goods, including defence and security products, and has asked for a 45-day delay in the imposition of U.S. tariffs, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh said in a statement issued late on Monday.

Hanoi will also seek faster deliveries of commercial planes that Vietnamese airlines have ordered from the U.S., Chinh said at a cabinet meeting late on Monday.

The Southeast Asian country, a major regional manufacturing base for many Western companies, last year had a trade surplus of more than $123 billion with the U.S., its largest export market.

Chinh said Vietnam had asked the U.S. to delay the 46% tariff rate that U.S. President Donald Trump announced last week to allow time for negotiations.

Vietnam was seeking to ""negotiate with the U.S. side for balanced and sustainable trade, in line with the interests of the two sides,"" the statement said.

White House trade adviser Peter Navarro highlighted major concerns on Monday, including transhipping from China, the dumping of seafood and other goods, and intellectual property issues.

""They engage in intellectual property theft,"" Navarro told CNBC, regarding Vietnam. ""They have the biggest number of cases aside from China at the Department of Commerce on the dumping.""

In Monday's statement, Chinh said Vietnam would review issues such as its monetary policy, exchange rate, non-tariff barriers and ensuring the correct origin of goods, in line with the concerns aired by Navarro.

In a statement on Tuesday, following a tariff task force meeting, the government said Vietnam was also considering adjustments to its current bilateral trade agreement with the United States, adding content on tax and intellectual property.

The country's benchmark stock index (.VNI), opens new tab has fallen nearly 14% since Trump's announcement of the tariffs on April 2. The index fell 6.26% to 1,135 in early trade on Tuesday.

On Friday, Trump and Vietnam's leader To Lam agreed to discuss a deal to remove tariffs, both leaders said after a telephone call that Trump described as ""very productive"".

Since an arms embargo was lifted in 2016, U.S. defence exports to Vietnam have been largely limited to coastguard ships and trainer aircraft.

Last year sources said there were talks on sales of Lockheed Martin C-130 Hercules military transport planes to Hanoi.

1jng5mt,reddit,Why were the old ladies rude to me when I was in ho chi minh,"I thought I would enjoy my solo travel in Ho Chi Minh City, but to my surprise, it became draining for me. Vietnamese people are nice—I’ve been to other countries, and I can say that I felt comfortable with how hospitable and helpful people are here despite the language barrier.  

I don’t want to generalize, but my interactions with older women in Ho Chi Minh left me exhausted. At Ben Thanh Market, while I was eating, an old lady grabbed my drink and told me to move to the corner so two white people could sit—even though there was clearly space for them. I almost cried because I felt discriminated against. When I asked her where I could buy clothes at a fair price, she just laughed at me and didn’t answer.  

At Cho Binh Tay Market, an old woman sold me a scrunchie for double the price and even signaled to her friend while pointing at me after I bought it. Another older woman at a clothing store stared at me from head to toe the entire time I was there, making me so uncomfortable that I left.  

I didn’t enjoy my time in Ho Chi Minh because these experiences drained my energy. Maybe it was because of my ethnicity, or maybe I’m just overthinking things since I was alone. Still, I felt comfortable with people my age or younger—they were so nice and hospitable. I just had a lot of negative experiences with older women there. I love traveling, but I hate when these things happen because I love exploring countries and cultures. Experiences like this make me scared to try new things or visit unfamiliar places.

EDIT: And there are people here invalidating my experience calling me the r word, b”tch, entitled, sensitive or there’s something wrong with me.  If you had a nice experience that’s nice and I wish you the best, but I had a different one and Im just sharing my experience here. Vietnam is literally richer than the country I came from, I don’t live a comfortable life, I’m not rich and I’m not white. I asked why, now im thankful for the nice people that educated me more about the culture, shared their experience, uplifted me and understood what happened. Thank you for the nice people that replied in this post❤️

1jqcfia,reddit,"Too foreign for home, too foreign for here. Yet never enough for both","Hi, I recently visited VN after 10+ years of living overseas and it was rather a heartbreaking experience (or maybe I’m just overtly sensitive ?).
I was born and raised in the deep south, small little village where community really meant everyone knew everyone and every day was pretty mundane. But it was peaceful, and I was always a happy child. 
Moved to the states during my teens, and of course had my fair share of struggles coming from a small Viet town, with no English, both parents with little to no money, no skills that were valued in the States.
Anyways, fast forward to now, in my mid 20s, and I was so excited to come back home. Yet I was treated with such distant from the folks back home. They look at me like the other, and oddly enough, just giving me the worst attitudes. When it comes to family, everyone was extremely critical of everything I say & do. When I invite them out to eat, everyone said the place served bad food, when I bring them coffee, oh the coffee sucks. 

I speak the language perfectly fine, I can communicate affectively. So all of this comes to me as a shock. It’s like folks here (in my small town) didnt like me, but truly I didn’t say or do anything that I thought was offensive. I know the Viet community both in the US and back home value “saving face” and wealth is a big factor. I make average $, I don’t wear designer clothes, mid looking…etc. just a simple man. I was told by my parents that when I go out, make sure to give extra to cab drivers or young folks working at the restaurants. But when I do, they give me exact change and say they didn’t need it from someone like me? But when I dont, they call me a cheapskate for being “Viet kieu.”
Side note, when I was in Saigon, where I didn’t have any family and was just touring around, minding my business, every Viet person was very friendly and kind. So def not generalizing here. 
I expected the childhood that I left, hoping to find some sense of belonging and yet home never felt so different. I don’t feel at home in the US either.

Posting to see if anyone had a similar experience or has some insights on why I’m being treated this way, I’m sure my experience isn’t unique and again, maybe I’m just overtly sensitive.

1juxhvu,reddit,Clearing assumptions about Ha Long/Lan Ha/Bai Tu Long bay,"I work in the bay and want to provide some information for everyone after seeing a lot of assumptions from post and comments.

1st off, the pollution in the bay, most of these pollutants doesn't actually come from tour boats, but the fisherman illegally living in floating houses and their aqua farms, there used to be around 3 thousands fishermen that lived in many floating villages in the bay that were moved outside from 2012-2018 but there are still a few hundred illegally living and farming in the bay, their house and farm float on polystyrene or styrofoam + bamboo, so when they replaced them with new ones, they just let the old ones freely drift.
They live in the middle of the sea, far from land, some of their children couldn't even go to school because of how far it is and how much fuel it cost for them each trip, so they don't bring any of their trash to land for disposal either, not saying i condone anything, just that i understand why they do this.
That's not to say none of the pollutants comes from the tourism, i've seen both tourist and sometimes the crew throw things in the water, although it's rare for the crew to do so because if they get caught, the fines are very large and the boat might get suspended, tourism make up a very very small portion of pollutants, in fact, they are what saving the bay.
Which brings me to what's being done about it, there are people at the harbor and boats in the bay paid to pick up the pollutants everyday as they come in with the tides, at sun harbor they don't allow tourist to bring plastic bottles on the boats, and as i've mentioned before, they relocated and disband all the floating villages in the bay, which is good for the environment as before this, there were much much more pollutants in the bay, but horrible for the fisherman who daily lives depends on fishing in the bay.
All of this is payed for by the tourism, if there were no tourist here and if they didn't complain, nothing would be done about it and there wouldn't be any funding to do anything, like so many other place that's not a tourist hot spot in Vietnam, some of the pollutants comes from the surrounding province because they don't have the money from tourism that Quang Ninh has to even try to clean up, the tour boats are taxed for cleaning the bay, for how many berrel of trash they disposed of everyday at the harbor, and there's a fee for selling plactic water bottle and drinks on the boats as well, compared to 10 years ago, the bay is much cleaner now, but there is still much to improve, the important thing to remember is that there are improvements, it just takes time.

2nd, access to the bay, the bay is not an open area where you can come and go as you please, if you want to enter, you need to buy a ticket or have permission to work here, the tour boats can't just go wherever and whenever they want, they have to follow government regulation, there are 4 route the boats can register to visit and designated parking area, sleeping area, kayaking and swimming area, this is why you see all the boats going the same way and stopping at the same spots.
There's a limit of 500 boats in Ha Long, it's currently full with 170 overnight boats and 330 day boats, 200 limit in Lan Ha with all 200 slot registered but only around 60 boats current running, the rest have not come out yet, there are like, 13 boats on average in Bai Tu Long because it's very far from land, but they are planning on bumping that number up to 100 this year, i'm not sure if these will be new boats or they are just gonna move boats from Ha Long to Bai Tu Long.
Yes it's crowded, but Ha Long is the #1 destination in Vietnam, i legit get people who told me there should be private boat that go to a private area where there are no one else, that's like me going to Paris and not expecting crowd of tourist and demanding private experience at the Eiffel tower.

3rd, the different bays, Ha Long and Bai Tu Long belongs to Quang Ninh province while Lan Ha belongs to Hai Phong city, they're under different management, regulations, ticket prices, they compete against each other for tourists, hence the tour boats can only register to go to one or the other. 
In term of scenery, there's not much difference, however Ha Long has the biggest cave, a beach, and an island you can climb to the top on, and Lan Ha give you access to visit Cat Ba island.
The Movie ""kong skull island"" was filmed in Ha Long using helicopter, planes and boats, there are no movie set or island they filmed on, the 2005 Peter Jackson King Kong was not filmed here and the James Bond island is in Thailand, not Ha Long.

1k2b2t5,reddit,Too difficult to live in Vietnam as a foreigner these days?,"My own thoughts:

- Difficult economy: less hours, harder to find a job & lots of competition for work, wages stagnant (in real terms, going backwards in some cases). 

- Difficult paperwork: everything from licences to work permits to TRCs and everything in-between is either more difficult than in the past, or the rules are always changing rapidly & unexpected.

- Banking: the moment your visa turns over, your account is frozen. (Only country where this has ever happened to me personally. Particularly galling as it's all taxed income.)

- Friendliness: sentiment is that Saigon and Hanoi are not 'friendly' cities these days. Much, much harder to make local viet friends than in the past. 

Interested in hearing feedback.

I only post this as I am curious to see the opinion of foreigners at the current time. Especially those that have lived in Vietnam for some time.

Not intended as a critique of Vietnam (adding this as I know some people will jump down my throat) but as a realistic summerization of foreigners in Vietnam and their thoughts.

1jmkax8,reddit,Loved Vietnam !!,"TLDR: Loved Vietnam. Leaving Vietnam with a heavy heart. I will definitely come back.  

I (27M) came to Vietnam for a short trip with my friends. We were just able to visit HCMC, Da Nang and Hanoi.

Things I loved :
1) Everywhere we visited, the people were VERY friendly and welcoming.
2) The rich cultural heritage left me awestruck.
3) Don't even get me started on the Vietnamese coffee ! I don't know how many of that I have had in the past week.
4) The party scene was quite good.
5) The weather was pleasant and amazing.

I couldn't try out the local cuisine as much as I wanted to because of some dietary preferences. I also couldn't visit a few places because of the trip during being short.

I had heard of some scams before visiting but my experience was completely positive.

Personally, I just wish the sex tourism was less common. It is just a personal opinion.

I hope we respected the local culture and norms and didn't offend anyone.

Context:

* Australian-born Vietnamese based in Melbourne, Australia. 
* I've experienced rejection from girls from a variety of ethnicities in Australia, so I'm no stranger to rejection.
* However, I'm used to phrases like: ""Sorry, I'm not interested"", ""Sorry, I have a boyfriend"" or ""Let's be friends"". I think Australians are a little more direct about it.
* Over the past ~2 years, I've asked 3 VN girls out for coffee or to hang out some time and the response has interestingly been the same ""I'll think about it""
* Initially, I was happy with the response because it seemed like it's a ""maybe"" and that she might get back to me at a later stage, but after asking out 2/3 of the girls a 2nd time a month or two later, I was met with the same response ""I'll think about it"".
* After asking around, it seems like this is their polite way of saying ""no"" that I was quite unfamiliar with as I was born in Australia.
* Thought I'd share this with any expats, Westernised-Vietnamese people or just people in general that plan on asking a Vietnamese person out in this subreddit! :)",2025-03-26 13:21:55,VietNam,VietNam,news,News,[],0,75,98,,0.78,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1jkbn33/ill_think_about_it_vn_girls_way_of_rejecting/,VietQuads

1jn1im1,reddit,"I’m Viet kieu, any advice on how to handle criticism from my relatives?","I love Vietnam a lot and genuinely care for my relatives, but, unfortunately, whenever I visit I always get criticised a lot, and it takes a huge toll on my mental health. I’m in my late 20s, unmarried and I have tattoos. I usually visit my relatives in Vietnam every 5 years and I have a trip coming up this year.

My cousins are pretty chill and they don’t care, but it’s usually my aunties/uncles and my grandma who like to comment on my weight, my tattoos, my acne and so on. They would say that I have health problems because I don’t eat on purpose to stay skinny (which is not true, I’ve always been small, but I love viet food and I make sure to eat as much as I can), they say that I’m stupid and that’s why I get scammed, they say that I look awful because of my tattoos and acne. They constantly comment on my marital status, they try to get as much information about my relationship as possible and then tell me that’s it’s a disgrace to our family that I date a white guy. To be fair, they never criticise my clothes (because I make sure to dress appropriately), but it’s still really hard for me.

Sometimes I try to defend myself (which I do politely of course, I’m never rude to my relatives) and they get offended and tell me that if I respected Vietnamese culture, I wouldn’t have talked back when they’re teaching me. When I don’t have the emotional capacity to respond, I just sit there and listen and then go quietly cry somewhere in the bathroom.

My parents tell me to just be patient, but it’s really hard to ignore when I get criticised almost on a daily basis for what seems to be really trivial things about me that don’t hurt or offend anyone. 

It’s really difficult because family means a lot for me, especially because they are my ties to Vietnamese culture, so it’s important for me to maintain a good relationship with my relatives. I just want to know what to do to make things easier between us. I hope fellow viet people here can offer some advice so that I can prepare for my upcoming trip.

1jke6wn,reddit,Here's what I love about the country after 3 months,"I've spent the last ~3 months traveling through Vietnam as a digital nomad.

Hanoi -> Ta Van -> Quy Nhon -> Dalat -> HCMC

I've stayed at each place for 2-3 weeks. Had a phenomenal time overall.

To be clear: I don't come from a rich country. I'm from India so I don't find Vietnam to be cheap. The cost is the same as back home. Maybe a bit more expensive here because I know how to get good deals back home.

That said, here's what I love:

1. Amazing food. Fresh vegetables and suitable spice for my Indian palate
2. Probably the best coffee in the world. The variety and nuance of the different coffee from north to south is insane
3. Beautiful nature. A lot of it well maintained 
4. Good roads: this might come as a shocker but I've seen much worse roads
5. I only lived in non touristy areas. All the locals were always friendly and no one tried to scam me
6. Active people. I saw middle aged men and women indulging in football, volleyball, yoga, dance almost everywhere.

Here's what I think needs improvement. Both of these problems are seen in my country as well. This is not a comparison or derogatory post:

1. A lot of plastic use in daily life. I hope this is getting disposed properly by the government
2. The air pollution. The government needs to work on the air pollution as health care will only get more burdensome if the pollution continues

1k52o37,reddit,Trip report - 18 days in Vietnam,"Since this sub was so helpful when I (solo 43F) planned my itinerary, I thought I’d give back to the community with a trip report - hopefully someone will find it useful! I like my itineraries fairly packed (which I think will be clear from the below), but I genuinely didn’t feel rushed at all during this trip - obviously everyone likes a different pace so YMMV.

TLDR: it was amazing. Go to Vietnam.

Wednesday 2 April - flew out of London (direct flight with Vietnam Airlines).

Thursday 3 April - landed in Ho Chi Minh City early afternoon. Took a taxi to the service apartment I had booked in Japan Town (INDO Serviced Apartment) and walked around the area. It’s definitely a red light district, which could put some people off, but it really was absolutely fine and I never felt unsafe. The apartment itself wasn’t amazing, it looked nothing like the pictures online, but it did what it needed to do, it was cheap and I only saw one live cockroach inside. Worked out in the gym attached to the apartment, went for a massage in the evening and discovered that supermarkets in that part of town sell melonpan, which made me very happy.

Friday 4 April - explored District 1. Worked out that the way to cross the street is “have faith”, strolled around Ben Thanh market, took a look at Notre Dame Basilica (from the outside because it was temporarily closed when I went), the Central Post Office, went to the War Remnants Museum (terrible pictures but I think important to see/not forget). Went to the zoo and wished I hadn’t. Went for a run on the treadmill (which I really dislike but running outdoors in Ho Chi Minh City didn’t seem as easy/straightforward as in other places). In the evening I had a food tour with XO Tours and it was absolutely fantastic - very strongly recommended (in particular as they take you outside of District 1) and I wish I’d booked their other tours too! 

Saturday 5 April - kept exploring Ho Chi Minh City. Went to the Jade Emperor Pagoda, Tan Dinh market and Phu Chau floating temple (the latter is a bit out of the way but easily reachable with a Grab bike and, I thought, worth visiting). In the evening I had a tasting menu at Anan Saigon - good but not mind-blowing, but the relaxed atmosphere and the chilled bartender made it worth it.

Sunday 6 April - took a day trip combining the Cu Chi tunnels and Mekong delta. Discovered coconut candy and my life changed.

Monday 7 April - flew to Da Nang then went straight to Hoi An. Had my first egg coffee and my life changed (and that’s even before I tried salted coffee, which ended up being my favourite). Stayed at Maison Hai Homestay and it was fantastic. Had a lovely evening food tour with a company called Hoi An Food Tour, ate lots of delicious food and played a hilarious game of traditional Vietnamese bingo. 

Tuesday 8 April - Had a great early morning run along the river (we’re talking 5 am. Any later is way too hot already) and took a day trip to the old imperial city in Hue. The tomb of the last king (which we visited in the afternoon) was my favourite spot.

Wednesday 9 April - took an early morning trip to My Son sanctuary and Marble mountain - the 5:30 am departure was worth it to beat the crowds and the heat. Really enjoyed the sanctuary, the ruins look stunning. Chilled in Hoi An in the afternoon and went to a local gym to work out (Superfit Hoi An Fitness and Yoga - easy to get a day pass, good equipment, lockers, sells water, small towel provided to wipe equipment down but not convinced by the showers so I showered back at my homestay). Bought an extra “Fjallraven” bag to store all the coconut candy I bought on the Mekong delta day trip. 

Thursday 10 April - flew from Da Nang to Ha Noi. Explored the Old Quarter. Had my first Bun Cha and my life changed. Stayed in the Silk Grand Premium Hotel and Spa - it was neither premium nor grand but it did the job. Had a great massage in the evening. 

Friday 11 April and Saturday 12 April - early morning run around Hoan Kiem lake. Left my luggage at the hotel in Ha Noi and took a 2D/1N trip to Ninh Binh. This was the highlight of my trip (so far! Little did I know that my mind would be irreversibly blown only a few days later). Went to the Mua caves (do not go into the Tiger Cave! It was just an ankle-deep pond inside and you can’t see a thing, so I ended up with wet socks and shoes), a stunning bird sanctuary at sunset, biked around Tam Coc and through rice paddies, visited a local market in the morning, did the Trang An boat trip and unexpectedly stayed overnight in a gorgeous resort which was way more luxurious than what I’m used to (Lalita resort). Got back to Ha Noi mid-afternoon on the second day.

Sunday 13 April - Spent morning and early afternoon in Ha Noi. Did a really interesting tour called “Stories from Vietnam war at not-to-go-alone areas”. Discovered avocado ice cream in a tall glass of avocado smoothie (at Cafe Kem Bo Xuka) and my life changed. Left my big luggage at what was going to be my next hotel in Ha Noi, packed a small bag and boarded a bus to Ha Giang at 4 pm. 

Monday 14 April to Thursday 17 April - premium 4D/3N Ha Giang loop with Road Kings and MY LIFE FUCKING CHANGED FOREVER. Nothing I have ever done comes close. Everything I did next was shit in comparison. I cried my heart out when it was over and, as I’m typing this on my flight back home, I’m seriously depressed. I was in a group of 9 and we bonded right away. The views were out of this world (the weather was absolutely perfect for the 4 days and visibility was excellent). The food was amazing. The camaraderie was incredible. I had an easy rider and he was the absolute best. I would go back to Vietnam in a heartbeat just to do the loop again and, if/when I do, it will 100% be with Road Kings again.

Friday 18 April - got back to Ha Noi around 2 am. The sleeper bus wasn’t as bad as I was led to believe (although it was certainly an experience) and we did have a rest stop (I’d heard horror stories of buses not stopping on the way. I’m glad mine did). Checked into the hotel where I had left my luggage (Golden Rooster - really nice, staff absolutely outstanding, would definitely return) and crashed for the night. Went to the Vietnamese Women’s Museum (really nice), the Temple of Literature and had a lunch tasting menu at Gia (not worth it. My life definitely did NOT change). Had a lovely evening run around Hoan Kiem lake.

Saturday 19 April and Sunday 20 April - went for an early morning run around the lake, then did a 2D/1N Lan Ha bay cruise. It wasn’t too busy although it was fairly overcast. Went with Venezia Cruise - by no means luxurious but the boat was fine, the bed was super comfortable and the views from the cabin obviously really cool. Food was a let down because it very clearly catered to westerners and therefore lacked flavour. Lan Ha bay was gorgeous but I personally preferred Ninh Binh. Back in Ha Noi mid-afternoon on the second day, wandered aimlessly to try and soak in everything I could and lamenting my impending departure.

Monday 21 April - flew home, utterly heartbroken. 

I didn’t expect it but I fell so hard in love (and not just with my easy rider). Normally at the end of a trip I feel ready to go home, but this time it feels like I am actually grieving and I am so, so sad to be returning to real life.

1jyd4rd,reddit,"Obsessed Fan Grabs Head, Scratches Sơn Tùng M-TP's Arm; Security Team Criticised","Sơn Tùng M-TP experienced an incident with an overzealous fan during the *Sky Wave* concert, held on the night of April 12 in Hạ Long (Quảng Ninh Province, Vietnam). The incident has sparked outrage among netizens and fans alike.

# Obsessed Fan Jumps on Sơn Tùng M-TP

According to the circulating video, a male audience member unexpectedly breached security, ran onto the stage, and forcefully hugged and then jumped on Sơn Tùng M-TP.

Though surprised by the aggressive behaviour, the artist quickly regained his composure and politely said: ""Calm down, thank you so much everyone.""

Despite being pushed away by Sơn Tùng M-TP, the obsessed fan continued circling back and tried to pull the artist close again.

Only after security appeared did the fan return to the audience area. Concerned for the fan's safety, Sơn Tùng M-TP was heard saying ""careful, careful"", and kept repeating ""it's okay, thank you very much"".

Based on photos and videos, Sơn Tùng M-TP sustained a light scratch on his arm, with visible abrasions and bleeding following the incident.

Online, many have expressed concerns about the professionalism of the organisers for allowing such a dangerous situation to happen.

Comments from viewers include: ""Where were the security guards? It took them 2-3 minutes to get up there,"" ""So frustrating to watch,"" and ""What kind of show is this? So poorly managed.""

Some also pointed out that ""whether you're a fan or not, you can't behave in a way that endangers the artist and disrupts the entire programme"".

In addition to criticism of the organisers, many viewers praised Sơn Tùng M-TP's ability to handle the situation. Despite the chaos, the artist remained calm and continued interacting warmly with fans.

So far, neither the male singer nor the event organisers have commented on the fan's aggressive behaviour.

# Controversial Concert?

Previously, this concert had already sparked frustration due to ticket price fluctuations.

Tickets went on sale on March 16 and sold out all 10,000 within a day. However, many people were unable to buy tickets, while on the black market, tickets were still being sold in large quantities.

This was believed to be caused by ticket scalpers hoarding large amounts of tickets, then rushing to undercut official prices.

Resale prices fluctuated by the minute, with some tickets selling for 20–50% less than the original price, or even as buy-one-get-one-free deals.

This led to malicious rumours on social media, especially when some seats appeared empty, with people speculating that Sơn Tùng M-TP's popularity might be ""cooling off"".",2025-04-13 17:34:00,VietNam,VietNam,news,News,[],0,62,19,,0.85,https://v.redd.it/31sseuh61nue1,notAssmin

1jtojdq,reddit,What’s with the anti Viet Kieu with northern VNmese?,"TLDR; running into a lot of “how can you be Viet if…” comments from seemingly northerners.

Some background: I was born in HCM, lived a bit in Cambodia, and then moved to the UK when I was eight. So my Vietnamese is at the level of an eight year old (speaking, reading, and writing). 

I’ve now had multiple instances where (seemingly northerners) have made rude comments towards me. 

2016 - First time was at Tan Son Nhat, I asked for help with a form and was told ”người Việt mà không biết tiếng Việt”. Basically how am I Vietnamese without knowing Vietnamese. 

2023 - Second time was in the Vietnamese embassy in London where they had no English forms and I asked for one and was sighed at and also berated for not knowing Vietnamese. Ended up following along with Google translate.

2025 - Third time, also Tan Son Nhat. Tried to set up for the autogate and the guy behind the counter spoke very fast with a strong northern accent (not something I’m exposed to much). Then when I told him I didn’t understand much he asked me how I could have a Vietnamese passport if I didn’t understand. To which I responded that I was born here and left when I was young. He of course responded saying I shouldn’t have one if I don’t understand… 

Each incident seems to have common themes. My inability to understand high level language, and their northern accents. 

Anyone else experienced something similar?

Edit:
Just want to make sure people are not getting the wrong end of the stick. Perhaps my choice of wording isn’t right. I’m just trying to understand if there is context I am missing for these encounters - which some of you have informed me about the sentiments from Northerns to Viet Kieus from the war (and I appreciate that) it adds context. 

I’m not trying to say all Northerners hate Viet Kieus, in my experience it just seems to happen when official documents/processes and a northern dialect is involved. I’ve had very loving and kind interactions with people from all over Viet Nam, including the north.

1k6ii7g,reddit,Observations from an American after 2 weeks,"Hi friends! I’m a Vietnamese-American who just spent about 2.5 weeks traveling Vietnam with my girlfriend for the first time. I wrote down some observations as we went along, mostly looking at differences from what we are used to in states. Tried my best to organize them into three categories: good, neutral, bad. I hope this is in no way offensive, just my perspective of things!

Good:
-Riding a motorbike is fun and the best way to get around. Renting one for yourself is also cheap and easy if you’re responsible
-Transportation is very cheap and easy in general 
-Food is abundant and cheap
-“Don’t be dumb” culture. Many experiences/things don’t require any kind of waivers or insurance (renting a motorbike for example). 
-Tipping culture is healthy. It’s not expected but I was happy to tip for great service on some things
-Homelessness not seen on any streets. Same with people begging for money, at least not in the way we see it
-Never saw people doing drugs on the street which is common in big cities in the US
-Cash based system has no coins which is nice
-Banh Mi everywhere 
-Many people are very willing to speak/learn English
-Excellent customer service in most places, many people eager to please tourists/want good reviews

Neutral:
-Hanoi is the most chaotic city I have ever been to but was very fun at times
-Traffic laws are a suggestion. Overtaking into oncoming traffic is very common
-Everything is labeled “luxury” and “VIP” which are kind of just standard or a little nicer than standard, not truly luxury by most standards
-“Bussing” tables didn’t appear to be a thing. In most casual restaurants in the US, when you’re done with your meal you throw away your garbage and partially clean off your table yourself so someone else can use it after

Bad:
-The trash/littering problem is really bad. The Hmong communities in Sapa were the most jaw dropping but really I saw it everywhere, streets and rivers lined with trash
-Throwing things in the water. Kind of goes off the last point, I saw so many locals throw trash into Lan Ha bay and on our boat in Ninh Binh. So sad to see in such beautiful places that should be protected 
-The touristy places are ultra touristy, more than I’ve seen anywhere else. Takes away almost all authenticity to places (Sapa and Hoi An prob the worst)
-Adding to last point, the rapid development of Cat Ba is disheartening to see. Literally filling a gorgeous bay with concrete for shopping and more hotels at the cost of local businesses is NOT what tourists want
-Photo/selfie culture is annoying. Many people seem to be going to places only to take photos as that is the primary goal. This seemed to be mostly Vietnamese and other Asian tourists (and mostly women) but this is a generalization
-Many things not having prices. Felt like I never knew when I was getting scammed or getting haggled. I just want to know the price everyone pays. Near the end of the trip I avoided places without posted prices
-Bus drivers are insanely aggressive
-No one actually deep cleans bathrooms/showers. Every home stay or hotel (even the expensive ones) had visible mold and mildew in the cracks and grout of a lot of surfaces. Public bathrooms were not fun
-Street vendors sell Chinese junk. Many even lie about items being handmade when I saw them at many places
-Smoking is very common, including seeing children smoking. Out of the hundreds of people I know around my age (25-30yo) I know of maybe less than 5 people that smoke
-Lack of parks in cities. There are pickleball courts here and there but overall a lack of public space for kids or adults to recreate

1jycoam,reddit,Moving to Vietnam,"Hi, I’m from the U.S. and got married to a Vietnamese woman in Vietnam two years ago. I knew her the previous 5 years on Facebook. I lived in Seattle, and made several Vietnamese friends there that introduced us. 

I always wanted to visit her, she made me wait 5 years, lol. Fell in love before we ever met. 

We were originally going to try and get her immigration here. The last two times I was in Vietnam, I fell in love with the country and the people. Her family loves me, and don’t expect anything from me than to be happy. 

I like the U.S., but live Vietnam. I have no real family here…and have hers there. I told her I’d like to move to VN, and the entire family was happy. 

They are not rich, not poor, own businesses and live comfortable lives. I’m not rich either. Everyone I met there was very kind to me. 

I plan on coming in about a month. With all this Trump news going on, I hope people are still kind to Americans that love Vietnam.

Then we went to Hue, and to Da Nang. Went to the most popular tailors there, and the pricetags for identical models from also 100% silk, of the same fabric texture and feel, cost 35-50$. With a way bigger selection of silk even.

So this post is not to defame any tailor in hoian or to convince people to get their clothes tailored elsewhere, this is just my experience. The price me and my wife paid for a kimono and a dress was enough to buy about 5 custom made silk kimonos for my entire family + lots of silk for my mum.

1k67ypd,reddit,"Vietnam starts trade talks with US as immense 46% tariffs loom, state media reports","HANOI, April 23 (Reuters) - Vietnam's trade minister spoke to U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer by phone on Wednesday, state-run media reported, kicking off trade talks as whopping 46% U.S. tariffs loom, threatening growth in Southeast Asia's industrial hub.

The U.S. has paused imposing the 46% reciprocal tariffs on Vietnam until July. If applied, it could undermine growth in Vietnam, which relies on exports to its top market, the United States, and large investments by foreign manufacturers.

""Vietnam is ready to deal with existing issues on the basis of mutual interests,"" broadcaster Vietnam Television reported, citing the trade minister, Nguyen Hong Dien, who heads the Vietnamese negotiation team.

""The U.S. side hopes to reach mutual agreement towards a stable and sustainable trade relationship,"" VTV reported.
The USTR did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment regarding the phone conversation.

Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh on Tuesday instructed officials to combat trade fraud, counterfeiting and other issues of concern for the United States.

Vietnam has the fourth-largest trade surplus among all U.S. trading partners, worth $123.5 billion last year.

I have witnessed one of the trainers ruthlessly whip a horse when it went into the fence. When the trainee explicitly says: I think my horse is in pain. She’s pinning her ears back, sometimes slipping and bucking. Can you please check the tack and if i’m doing something wrong. 

They respond: no, no, it’s fine, just continue. 

And the trainer must know better, right? Wrong. After the lesson after the person got off the horse was foaming at the mouth and had eye wrinkles. That is wrong. I am not going back.

And one of the horses that got loose and slammed into another horse on gallop because the it was obviously improperly trained, the trainer and human is always at fault, I had witnessed it get whipped.

And why i couldn’t do anything? I am a kid. No one will listen to a teen. The adults know better right? The same adults who pout and whine when my mom wants to switch trainers because the trainer before was not right for me. The same adult who now glares at me when i come to train, or rather, came to train. These are man-children who take their anger out on helpless animals. I hope they get shut down. Please report them.

1jug4ej,reddit,Go watch Tunnel/ Địa Đạo. Highly recommend!,"I know it kind of sudden, but HOLY SHIT! The movie is good. 

I came in, expecting something like: ""Captialism U.S.A bad!!!! Communism good, it is freedom, it is what we fought for!"" And hell, I set the bar so LOW! I even brought my sketch note and a pen with me write down the bad parts of the movie but it never leave my pocket until the credit roll. 

But no! It was Good, really good, to the point that I ponder whether or not it was made by A24. The story, the pacing, the message, the combat, the sound even, it was SO GOOD! Maybe the only downside I can mentioned of the fighter plane and that just it, it show once during the bombing, and all, 10 seconds in an 2 hour film. It leave time for moment to linger and rememberable. Especially some of the death brutal and raw but not to the point it completely romantize them. 

Maybe the character is a bit cliché and I do agree that some romantic part of the story is one of the weak point but it so small and was in the first stage movie that it kind of was wash over me. 

On top of that...FINALLY! NO ""HÀI NHẢM"" and that is such a fresh air. The humor is on point and fit with the moment and you could felt like it could be something they said in that moment.

Lastly, the message, it is pro-communism? Actually and unexpect-ly no. Maybe there is but it was so suttle and would wash over those who aren't native and trying dig too too deep into politic. And it is another great point of the movie because it felt relatable to my own belief of the core reason we fight was just for freedom, that it is. There are no politic, no communism ideal shove down my throat, it is just about 'Why we fight?' . Just that and it give me that patriotic feeling. 

I am not saying this because I am patrioic or communist ethutiastic or want to ""support Vietnamese movie industry"" kind of guy. I have seen bad Vietnamese movie, really bad one that have oversexulizing or just cringy, trying to copy major action movie (858 or something, really terrible). 

In conclusion: It is peak Vietnam Cinema for me, and if anything, it be like the Battlefield 1 of Battlefield franchise- a well-respected and well made historical media. Hope this is what they will put in Cu Chi Tunnel cinema, because it really fit compare to what they had now.

1jo5i2l,reddit,Vietnam's Ministry of Culture Directs Investigation into ViruSs Controversy on Social Media,"**The Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism is directing relevant authorities to investigate Vietnamese streamer and musician ViruSs, who has been hosting livestream sessions to publicly discuss [his romantic relationships with multiple women](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Polyamory).**

Nguyễn Danh Hoàng Việt, Chief of Office and spokesperson for the ministry, stated that the ministry has instructed authorities to look into ViruSs and several TikTokers who have been livestreaming discussions about his relationship controversies, drawing millions of viewers.

""The Authority of Broadcasting, Television, and Electronic Information will investigate the matter and provide the latest updates to the press,"" Việt said.

Previously, ViruSs had hosted livestreams to confront and clarify his relationships with women such as Ngọc Kem and rapper Pháo (Nguyễn Diệu Huyền), stirring up social media.

These live broadcasts attracted millions of viewers. On the night of March 28 alone, one session had over 4 million viewers, with peak concurrent viewership exceeding 1.5 million.

Clips from these confrontational livestreams have been widely shared across social media platforms, also garnering millions of views and comments.

Cultural researcher Đoàn Xuân Hương commented that young people today are driven by herd mentality—flocking to and sharing whatever generates buzz.

""But they don't realise that such 'drama' is highly toxic for young audiences, as it consists only of emotional disputes and personal matters.

If in the past, people would say, 'Private matters should be discussed behind closed doors,' today's youth expose everything for public scrutiny. To me, these are ugly stories with no educational value,"" Hương expressed.

TV host Lê Anh also criticised the trend, stating that ViruSs' livestream conversations with his acquaintances are purely personal, lacking verification, academic value, educational merit, or meaningful direction.

According to Lê Anh, ViruSs' livestreams are not only inappropriate but may also violate Decree 147, recently issued by the government to regulate livestream activities and account verification.

Lê Anh further commented: ""No country can advance if its youth waste hours watching romantic drama instead of investing in education, creativity, and their future.

Vietnamese youth deserve greater aspirations—beyond just a 'like', a midnight laugh, or a meaningless argument.""

---

ViruSs, whose real name is Đặng Tiến Hoàng, was born in 1990 in Hanoi. Coming from a family with an artistic background, he spent much of his childhood studying music and was trained in piano at the Hanoi Conservatory of Music, now known as the Vietnam National Academy of Music.

Later, he became a professional gamer, serving as captain of Hanoi Dragons, a well-known domestic *League of Legends* team.

In 2014, ViruSs retired from competitive gaming and transitioned into streaming and e-sports commentary. He is recognised as one of Vietnam's ""[Four Streaming Kings](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteFour)"", alongside Độ Mixi, PewPew, and Xemesis.

Beyond streaming, ViruSs has been active in the entertainment industry, composing, performing, and producing numerous hit songs.",2025-03-31 15:11:24,VietNam,VietNam,news,News,[],0,48,49,,0.84,https://i.redd.it/ki5g6p92j1se1.png,notAssmin

""Nguyễn Văn Nguyên (1910 - 1953) quê quán Châu Thành - Tiền Giang. Ông là một chiến sĩ cốt cán, nhà báo viết có tài, nhà văn nghệ nhân dân.""

**Direct English Translation:**  
""Nguyen Van Nguyen (1910 - 1953), from Chau Thanh district, Tien Giang province, was a key fighter, a talented journalist, and a writer of the people.""

Nguyen Van Nguyen (1910–1953) was a prominent journalist and revolutionary in Vietnam's history. Born on March 15, 1910, in Dieu Hoa village, My Tho province (now Ward 1, My Tho city, Tien Giang province), he left a lasting legacy through his leadership in journalism and his contributions to the revolutionary cause.

Nguyen Van Nguyen made significant contributions to the field of journalism, serving as Director of the Southern Information Department and editor-in-chief of newspapers such as Cuu Quoc Nam Bo. His sharp, impactful writing not only conveyed the revolutionary message but also inspired others to join the cause. Beyond his journalism, he actively participated in revolutionary activities, holding key roles in building the resistance movement in southern Vietnam.

His death in 1953 marked the loss of a pivotal figure in Vietnam’s cultural and revolutionary history. Posthumously honored by President Ho Chi Minh with the First Class Independence Medal, his name endures in schools, streets, and commemorations in provinces like Tien Giang and Ben Tre, underscoring his continued impact on Vietnam’s identity.

1k6o4zk,reddit,"In This New World Disorder, You Need Vietnam's Bamboo Diplomacy","With the US resembling Russia and China as an imperialist bully, more countries should emulate Vietnam and bend with the geopolitical winds to avoid snapping.

I observe international affairs from Washington, capital of a superpower which used to be the world’s more-or-less benevolent hegemon, but which is now groping for a different role as a potential imperialist carving up the planet into spheres of influence.

But what if you’re looking back at us in Washington from the capital of a non-major (if not “small”) power? A place, say, like Hanoi, Jakarta, New Delhi, Pretoria, Abuja, Brasilia or Mexico City — or indeed Copenhagen, Ottawa or Panama City?

My advice, roughly 100 days into the second presidency of Donald Trump: Emulate Vietnam and adopt some version of its “bamboo diplomacy.” Bend with the geopolitical winds so that you don’t snap. Keep all the major powers distant, if not equidistant, and hedge your bets. Trade with all who are open to it, and in multilateral arrangements where possible. Enter into fluid alliances to deter Russia, China, the US or anybody else where necessary, sometimes with one against the others. Don’t trust the pacts you make with any of them, but don’t provoke either. Do anything that will let you stay independent and sovereign.

Since that sounds a bit like bamboo swaying in the breeze — a motif that runs through Vietnam’s forests, art and psyche — the country’s late leader, Nguyen Phu Trong, made the plant a foreign-policy metaphor. In dealing with the world, he said, Vietnam needs “strong roots, stout trunk, and flexible branches.” That makes sense for a country that has struggled for national survival against mighty and shifting powers such as China, France and the United States, and now prizes its independence and sovereignty, the roots and trunk, above all other interests.

Vietnam’s maximalist version of bamboo diplomacy rests on “four no’s”: No joining permanent alliances, no siding with one country against another, no letting other powers use its territory to launch wars and no threatening force in settling disputes. In practice, Vietnamese foreign policy amounts to finesse and balancing — signing a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership with Washington (which will be a useful friend if China seizes Vietnamese shoals in the South China Sea) while simultaneously inking 36 cooperation agreements with Beijing in the name of building a “shared future.”

Vietnam also illustrates a drawback of bamboo diplomacy, though. After Russia invaded Ukraine, Hanoi faced a moral dilemma. It genuinely sympathized with Ukraine and decried the violation of its sovereignty. But it needed to avoid taking sides against Russia. The result looked less like bamboo and more like a contorted bonsai tree. Hanoi kept talking to Moscow and abstained from censuring the Kremlin at the United Nations. Simultaneously, it extended bilateral solidarity toward Kyiv and sent humanitarian aid.

Other countries, especially in the Global South, already have similar foreign policies under different names. India aims for “multi-alignment”: It’s a member of the Quad (a Western-flavored quasi-alliance including New Delhi, Washington, Canberra and Tokyo) while simultaneously buying oil and weapons from Russia, and teaming up with Russia, China and others in the BRICS forum. Singapore, an island state and maritime node, practices “equidistant diplomacy” between the US and China.1 Turkey sees itself as a bridge between East and West and belongs to NATO while buying Russian missile-defense systems.

In that way, bamboo diplomacy under any name is a better alternative to another strategy for minor powers that want to stay sovereign in the shadow of behemoths: Finlandization. It got its name from the arrangement Finland reached with the Soviet Union in 1948, when it agreed to remain non-aligned with what would become NATO and the European Union, in effect yielding to Moscow’s foreign policy in return for staying independent.2 In botanical terms, a Finlandized country is like an epiphyte, a plant that grows on another plant and agrees not to bother its landlord. Much better to be bamboo.

Until recently, I would have counseled a grand strategy superior to either bamboo or epiphyte foreign-policy. While the Pax Americana lasted — that is, the international order in which America usually plumped for the system and its rules and against aggression — I would have urged countries to pick one camp and make sure it’s the American-led West. It has, broadly, been militarily strong, economically prosperous and politically free.

But Trump canceled the Pax Americana in the name of America First, abandoning international order for anarchy and probably chaos. In this brave new world, pure idealism (thinking in terms of democracies against autocracies, say) is no longer a viable national strategy. Nor is rote allegiance to the US. The world under Trump is likely to get tempestuous, and your best bet of staying rooted and upright is to become bamboo.

But then he said something I didn't understand. Literally I couldn't understand what he said, it was in Vietnamese, but he told me it was a proverb and had something to do with beauty (I don't remember it that well, he was having trouble translating it). I didn't really know how to respond so I just kept saying thank you, it wasn't really an awkward moment though.

 That was awhile ago, and I don't think I'd been in much after that. But some time last week, one of the ladies from the shop came to my job (I work at a grocery store) and while we were talking she mentioned that this guy missed me. Missed me. He missed me and she knew about it, so he was talking about me. Anyway, I told her I was gonna come in next week (today as of when I'm writing this). So I come in today, expecting him to be there because my mom had called ahead, and he wasn't. I was disappointed ngl. But that didn't matter for long, because someone FaceTimed him while I was getting my nails done and handed me the phone?? And he apologized for not coming because he was sick, said he thought I was never coming back, etc. That's unorthodox right? For all your coworkers to know you want to see a specific customer so badly that they call you while that customer is there, so you can say speak to them?

1jnvgvw,reddit,Marriage in Vietnam as a foreigner experience,"So I was preparing to get married in Vietnam and was trying to get the paperwork ready in the US. I made a huge mistake and wasted a lot of time and money, so don't make the same mistake as me. I was initially following this [list of requirements](https://vn.usembassy.gov/marriage/). I thought I could get each of those requirements like Affidavit of Single Status, Record of no marriage myself in the US first. I made the mistake of trying to get these papers notarized and translated by a public notary in the US. Don't do this! I came to Vietnam with these papers and they said it was useless and to throw it away and had to rush to make a real appointment for the real documents, with the aid of some lawyers based in the US but had staff physically in Vietnam to help. Luckily everything turned out okay.

So what you need to do is, online, make an appointment to go to the U.S. Consulate, Đại sứ quán, in Saigon or Hanoi for a marriage application. Once there, you can have someone wait outside to hold your stuff for you, there is highland coffee next to the consulate in saigon. What you need to bring inside is your passport and the printed form for the Affidavit of Single Status, Độc Thân and the form for the certified copy of the foreigner's passport, and some money. These are the only two you need to get notarized and each document costs $50 so $100 in total. I recommend bringing cash, like a clean $100 but I believe they also accept debit cards. When entering the consulate, you will pass through security where you leave your phone in a locked box and go into a few rooms with other people waiting for their appointments, such as trying to get their lost passport replaced, interview for entering the US and other marriage applicants. 

Once they call your name, you tell them the purpose of what you are doing there, and you give them the forms and your passport and pay the fee. Wait a bit and then they will come back with documents with the official red stamp and seal. Once that is done, they will ask if you are planning to use this document in Vietnam or outside. Since I was getting married in Vietnam, I said in Vietnam. Then they gave some instructions to go to another government building nearby to authorize the signature. However, I did not do this part personally, because I had a vietnamese lawyer (name of the tax/immigration office was “TOAN VU” from Oakland california).  helped us and they took care of that for us. And they also printed out the forms for us (after we emailed them all our scanned documents) and told us what to sign. And the staff waited outside for me. Their service was $200, which seems fair as they took care of all the paperwork for us. And since I messed up right before, I had to make sure everything was 100% correctly done this time. Unless you are good at Vietnamese law, I’d recommend just paying an expert to do the paperwork and make the appointments for you. Then I waited a day, this staff person came to our hotel and dropped off the documents once the signature authorization was done. So in summary, the two papers that you need notarized with the red stamp at the US embassy/consulate in SGN or HN are the single status paper and the certified copy of passport. Since the form is already in Vietnamese and English, it doesn't need to be translated.

After you have those two documents, go back to your spouse's home province. Make sure you get a photo printout 3x4 cm of your photograph and your spouses’, there are a lot of places that do copy and photographs, they also photoshop to make the photos look professional. The final document you need is the mental health exam. This has to be done at the local hospital, not a big international hospital like vinmec or anything. You don’t need to make appointments, just show up, just that they close on weekends I believe. You can tell that the hospital offers this service since the hospital often has a big board that lists the medical services and marriage mental health exam should be one of them. I read online of someone's experience that they make you put probes and electrical sensors on your brain and take urine tests. We were not subjected to that extent but all we had to do was just take an IQ test, which was the Raven's Progressive Matrices for pattern recognition. You and your spouse go into different rooms and the staff steps out to let you work on the test. Tbh, I finished pretty quickly but my wife was slow at taking the test and so just went into my room and copied my answers, I guess no one noticed or cared 😂. They check your answers to the IQ test, then you go over to the psychologist office where the psychologist reviews your information and asks some basic questions. For example, they asked me, “What is the capital of the US?”, to which I replied quickly, Washington D.C., to make sure I know why I’m there and I’m not dumb. After that, they sign the doctor’s note that you mentally well and not being coerced or anything, attach the face pictures to the paper, and they stamp it and you're good to go.

After you have those 3 documents, go to the People’s district committee, huyện ủy in your spouse’s home province/town. Before you enter the building, make sure you wear pants, same with the US consulate, because they won’t let you in if you wear shorts and flip flops. Then there will be someone that will help you do the marriage application. Once they have everything they will process the marriage application. Normally, for foreigners it takes 3 weeks to get it back, but I was in a rush and needed it done in 3 days before I leave. So my wife asked if it could be done faster, which I thought involved paying bribe money, but tbh, the staff was understanding and didn’t request extra money besides the standard application fee of around 1 million. After they give the completed marriage application back, which is an official government document with red paper, you will get a chance to sign it. I recommend recording it as a lot of people seem to do it on social media. After that you are all set and officially married and that marriage is also legal and recognized in the US also. The whole process is quite cumbersome for a foreigner, at least compared to two local vietnamese marrying, as you have to go to the capital or SG and take some hospital tests. But besides that, if you have external help, and native spouse, the marriage process is pretty straightforward.",2025-03-31 04:48:55,VietNam,VietNam,news,News,[],0,36,43,,0.85,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1jnvgvw/marriage_in_vietnam_as_a_foreigner_experience/,kirsion

Final version of the minimalist tribute poster: The Vietnamese Alphabet.

Big thanks to everyone here who gave feedback over the past month. From critiques to deeper conversations about language and identity—it shaped the final piece more than you know.

Context:
Growing up Viet Kiều, I never formally learned the Vietnamese language—just picked it up at home. At the same time, I was drawn to Swiss & Dutch design. I remember seeing an iconic IKEA poster back in ’99 featuring the Swedish alphabet and wondering: what if that was the Viet alphabet?

Years later, I finally made it. This started as a design exercise, but became something more—a bridge between language, history, and identity. A personal project turned poster, made for my younger self and others who grew up between cultures.

2. Boost in Trade and Digital Economy – Agreements signed during the visit aim to enhance trade, green economy, and digital transformation, helping Vietnam integrate further into global supply chains and modernize industries.

3. Stronger Regional Partnerships – Singapore is a key economic partner within ASEAN. Strengthening ties with Singapore enhances Vietnam’s economic resilience, particularly in sectors like logistics, financial services, and smart infrastructure.

4. Long-Term Growth Opportunities – The 2025-2030 action plan provides a framework for deeper cooperation, ensuring sustainable growth in areas like renewable energy, technology, and innovation.

I came from a rural village, and my parents (maybe just mother) worked in the rice fields. I do remember stilt houses, and I was supposedly in the northern mountains. I may have been Hmong or Muong. 

My biological father was the one to drop me off at the orphanage. Traveled by motorcycle. When the time came, my biological mother came to officially sign off on my adoption papers. Attached is a picture the orphanage used.

Đoàn Trần Nghiệp, also known as Ký Con, is remembered as a youthful and courageous revolutionary who rose to prominence in the Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng. Despite his small stature, his commitment to the cause of Vietnamese independence was anything but small. Joining VNQDĐ in 1928, he quickly became a trusted figure, managing party operations and taking part in daring missions against French colonial authorities.

In February 1930, Ký Con led an uprising in Hanoi, coordinating bombings and strikes to weaken the French regime. Even after his capture, he stood firm in his beliefs, declaring his dedication to driving the French out of Vietnam. His execution later that year marked him as one of the first martyrs of Vietnam’s independence movement.

Today, Ký Con is celebrated as a symbol of resilience and determination in Vietnam’s history, inspiring generations to continue the fight for freedom.

**Direct English Translation:**  
""Nguyen Trung Truc (1837 - 1868), from Tan An, Gia Dinh province, was a national hero in the resistance against French colonialism. He was captured by the French in 1868 and executed in Rach Gia.""

Nguyen Trung Truc (1838–1868), whose real name was Nguyen Van Lich, is one of the prominent national heroes in the resistance against French colonialism in Southern Vietnam. He was born in Binh Nhat village, Tan An district, Gia Dinh province (now part of Ben Luc district, Long An province) in a family that made a living through fishing.

Nguyen Trung Truc began his resistance activities when the French attacked Gia Dinh in 1859. He joined the resistance movement under the leadership of Truong Dinh and quickly demonstrated his leadership abilities. In 1861, he commanded a group of insurgents in the famous battle at Nhut Tao, where he burned the French ship L’Esperance, achieving a resounding victory.

After years of fighting, he was appointed by the royal court as the Governor of Gia Dinh province and the Commander of Ha Tien. However, after Ha Tien fell in 1867, he withdrew to Rach Gia and continued his resistance efforts at Hon Chong and Phu Quoc.

Nguyen Trung Truc is famous not only for his military achievements but also for his indomitable spirit. He repeatedly refused to surrender under pressure from the French forces. Finally, in October 1868, to protect his guerrilla forces and the people on Phu Quoc Island, he surrendered to the French. He was tried and executed in Rach Gia on October 27, 1868, at the age of 31.

Nguyen Trung Truc is revered by the people as a symbol of patriotism and the spirit of resistance. Many temples have been built to honor him, including those in Rach Gia and Phu Quoc. His image lives on in the hearts of the Vietnamese people as a symbol of resilience against foreign oppression.

1jziwfw,reddit,Just wondering if this is normal? Odd sleeper bus experience.,I’m on one of the VIP sleeper busses (actually the most expensive one I’ve been on) and a man (i think the driver’s assistant) just started laying on the floor right next to my bunk with a blanket and keeps hitting my curtain and listening to loud TikTok’s. It lowkey makes me uncomfortable and it’s the whole reason I pay more for the nicer sleeper busses is so that I don’t end up sleeping next to some random man. I payed like $30usd and in comparison to what I’ve payed for other busses i think it’s crazy this is happening on this one 😭😭 ,2025-04-15 04:14:56,VietNam,VietNam,news,News,[],0,17,26,,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1jziwfw/just_wondering_if_this_is_normal_odd_sleeper_bus/,lethatshitgo
1jytqu8,reddit,🚨 SCAM ALERT in Hanoi – Booking.com,"🚨 **Scam Warning – Avoid This Hanoi Host** 🚨

**Contact Number Used by Host:** \+84 81 204 3887  
**Addresses to Avoid:** 

20 P. Lê Văn Linh, Hàng Mã, Hoàn Kiếm, Hà Nội, Vietnam

Ng. 622 P. Minh Khai, Vĩnh Phú, Hai Bà Trưng, Hà Nội, Vietnam

If you book a hotel through [**Booking.com**](http://Booking.com) and the host changes and sends you to either of the addresses listed above -DO NOT GO. This is part of an ongoing scam.

Here’s what happened to us:

* After booking, he only allowed communication through Whatsapp. We later found out that he will constantly change his number and claim it isn't him when questioned by booking platforms.
* The host provided a new address 30 minutes away from the one listed. When we questioned it, he blamed Booking.com.
* We were threatened with full charges if we tried to cancel, leaving us feeling trapped.
* Later, we were moved again to a new property in the Old Quarter—this time, it only had one bed (we had booked two).
* The promised “free airport shuttle” was only available if we booked a tour through him.
* We were asked to pay via a third-party link, not through Booking.com.
* We never met the host in person; he made coffee shop workers check us in and would tell them instructions through the phone.
* When we left a bad review, the host contacted us from another WhatsApp number to insult us and laugh that we got scammed.

He continually changes listing names, addresses, and numbers, making it hard for platforms to hold him accountable. He will mark you as a no-show and claim that it wasn't him communicating with you.

⚠️ **Avoid this host at all costs.** Spread the word so others don’t go through the same thing.

1jwszcc,reddit,"AirBnb Experience in Vietnam, Customer Support accused me of breaking their non-discriminatory policy, and suspended my account after dealing with a scam host","Our host in Nha Trang Vietnam asked for additional cash payments for the monthly property maintenance fees, garbage removal, security, internet service, water, and electricity. We booked her apartment more than a month in advance, and she had many weeks to inform us but chose not to.

We refused, and if we canceled, the payment for the booking was non-refundable. #AirBnb supported us in not having to pay any extra fees, as this was a scam, and it was against/broke their policy.

When the host did not get her scam payments \[btw she stopped by the apartment many times with different people demanding cash payments throughout our stay which made it very hard to relax there\] she wrote some disgusting statements about myself and my family in a message, and in retaliation, I replied with a F++K you scamming B++ch \[I was upset reading her insults and after dealing with her behavior\].

My account was then suspended, and I was sent an email from AirBnb customer support, a statement to inform me of this, along with scathing feedback posted about us on AirBnb by the scammer host regarding our character and us in a very personal targeted way.

How is it possible to have this public posted feedback out us by a host that was unsuccessful in scamming their guest even allowed to be there?

Forget letting future guests know about a bad experience, best to keep it to yourself, and forget using AirBNB at all. Too many better more protected, ethical options available.

Is this a regular experience for others using AirBnb in Vietnam? Do my fellow Reddit peeps have any good things to say about AirBnb customer protection for the guest? or only for the hosts?

In 938, he lured the Southern Han fleet into the Bach Dang River and annihilated them using hidden wooden stakes—ending 1,000 years of Chinese rule. A year later, he crowned himself king, kicking off a new chapter of Vietnamese self-rule.

Direct English Translation:
“Nguyễn Trãi (1380–1442), known as Ức Trai, was a national hero and world cultural figure. His work “Bình Ngô Đại Cáo” is regarded as the second declaration of independence in Vietnam during the reign of King Lê Thái Tổ.”

—

Nguyễn Trãi, known by the pen name Ức Trai, was one of Vietnam’s most important historical figures. His role as a strategist during the Lam Sơn Uprising and his authorship of “Bình Ngô Đại Cáo,” considered Vietnam’s second declaration of independence, cemented his legacy as both a national hero and a cultural icon.

Nguyễn Trãi was more than a military leader. His works, including “Quân trung từ mệnh tập,” “Ức Trai thi tập,” and “Dư địa chí,” demonstrate a profound understanding of Vietnamese politics, culture, and geography. These writings reveal his vision of a just and independent Vietnam, blending Confucian, Buddhist, and Taoist philosophies to promote a humane and equitable society.

Despite his contributions, Nguyễn Trãi faced tragedy in the Lệ Chi Viên incident, where he was wrongfully accused of regicide, leading to his family’s execution. Years later, King Lê Thánh Tông posthumously exonerated him, recognizing his invaluable service to the nation.

Nguyễn Trãi’s influence endures not only through his literature and political philosophy but also as a symbol of patriotism, resilience, and intellect. His works and legacy remain a cornerstone of Vietnamese cultural and national identity.

1k1w6vr,reddit,Paying fine upfront for Ha Giang Loop without correct license,"I’m travelling from Australia to North Vietnam to do the Ha Giang loop.

I have an international driving license and AU license but the tour companies are telling it’s still illegal to drive with those. I need a 1969IDO and Australia uses a 1949IDO.

So they suggest either I pay 2 million Vietnamese dong upfront and they will bribe the police for me and no further costs. Or I should use an easy rider.

What what I’ve read on forums usually the police accept a much lower bribe / fine. Around 20USD or 500k dong.

The tour company states the fines have increased  since 2025 up to 7-8 million. Does anyone have any recent experience? Is 2 million a reasonable amount or if the company make a nice profit here? Has anyone else just paid upfront to avoid fees?

1jt6d0k,reddit,A Kind Soul at Hoa Lu Festival: Our Nighttime Rescue by Quy Nguyen,"We were at the Hoa Lu Festival 2025 in Ninh Binh, and the day was filled with emotions, surrounded by thousands of people celebrating. That same afternoon, Quy Nguyen, who we met through Tam Coc Queen’s Travel, had brought us to our hotel, which was about 15 minutes from the city. Before leaving, he handed us his card with a warm smile—a small gesture that, at the time, seemed like nothing more than a kind formality. Little did we know how much it would mean later on.
By around 11 p.m., with the festival still in full swing, there wasn’t a single taxi available to take us back to the hotel. Running out of options, I decided to text Quy, even though I knew he was likely resting after a long day. To our surprise, he replied almost immediately and, without hesitation, came to pick us up. Seeing him arrive, with the same calm and kindness he’d shown earlier, brought us such a sense of relief. He drove us back to the hotel, charging only the regular fare, as if it were the most natural thing in the world.
That moment really touched us. On such a hectic day, coming across someone like Quy, who went out of his way to help with so much generosity and humanity, even late at night, was something truly special. It’s such a blessing that there are still people like him out there, who, with simple acts of kindness, remind us of the value of caring for others.

Đỗ Trình Thoại (… - 1861) emerged as a key figure in Vietnam’s early resistance against French colonization. Serving as the district chief of Long Thành, he played a pivotal role in mobilizing local forces and forging alliances with prominent leaders such as Trương Định and Nguyễn Hữu Huân.

Sacrificing his life in the Battle of Gò Công, Đỗ Trình Thoại left behind a legacy of patriotism and determination. Despite the uncertainty surrounding his exact birth year, his actions resonate as a symbol of resilience during a period of great national upheaval.

First of, I didn't know about the horrible reputation VJ has. I only wanted to go to Hanoi for a short solo trip so I just picked based on price and timing. It was only 1 - 2 weeks before my trip that I was surfing through reddit that I realised what I've done

On the day of departure, I received an email when I woke up that my flight has been delayed by 1.5hrs. This was, well within my expectations as people have mentioned to always expect delays. At least I'm departing from Singapore and as you all might know, Singapore has one of the best airports in the world so I head there to have lunch and shopped around Jewel Changi. Checking in was fine I guess I just used the machine to print my boarding pass. 

When it was close to the boarding time, the plane is....not even there. I guess they exceeded my negative expectations of them even more so kudos to them. We did end up flying, somewhat. I just took a nap and took off my jacket halfway because the aircon was...not cold? 

Lucky for me immigration clearance was smooth I did not have to experience the nightmare that I read and my hotel pickup driver drove me to my place safely. 

Going back home 1 day before guess what yes I received another email saying my flight home will be delayed for 1.5hrs. Plus points for me tbh because I didn't want to wake up so early anyways they are so kind to inform me 8hrs in advance. 

When I woke up guess what, ANOTHER EMAIL. This airline must love their customers a lot to keep sending them emails so yes it was delayed by another 40min.

When I reached the airport, I'm not sure if it's the thing about VJ or the airport but the queue was so long? It wasn't that long for other airlines but whatever I was there early anyways. I had no check in luggage but the lady wanted to weight my carry on is this normal? Lucky for me I also read about VJ wanting to catch and force people to buy check in so I already preemptively took a lot of my luggage stuff to keep in my personal item bag that my luggage went from 7kg (when I left from Singapore) to 6.5kg even though I did bought extra stuff back. 

Oh and of course at the time of boarding the airplane is...you guessed it, NOT THERE. Somehow by some power of god or something we actually managed to take off on time as per the delayed timing. 

I'm now safely back in Singapore where I easily breezed through the automatic immigration barriers. 

I think I'm already immensely lucky to not be stuck for longer than what I already did and technically I wasn't stuck, I just came to the airport later than scheduled.

Direct English Translation:
“Nguyễn Tri Phương (1800–1873) was a prominent official of the Nguyễn dynasty. He served as the Commander-in-Chief of the Nguyễn army, leading the defense against French invaders in Da Nang (1858), Gia Dinh (1861), and Hanoi (1873).”

Nguyễn Tri Phương (1800–1873), a key figure in Vietnam’s history, emerged as a steadfast defender during some of the most critical moments in the Nguyễn dynasty. Born in Thừa Thiên - Huế, his brilliant military strategies and unyielding spirit are best known from his leadership during the French invasions. From the first attacks in Da Nang to his final stand in Hanoi, Nguyễn Tri Phương exemplified resilience, refusing to yield even in the face of certain defeat.

Captured and gravely wounded, Nguyễn Tri Phương’s final act of defiance—refusing to submit or cooperate with the French—cemented his legacy as a symbol of patriotism and honor. His sacrifices and determination live on as a testament to Vietnam’s enduring fight for sovereignty and independence.

I'm a Vietnamese citizen currently living in the U.S., and I already own properties in Trà Vinh and Vĩnh Long, so I’m not new to the property game in Vietnam. Lately, I’ve been looking at buying more real estate back home for investment and I’ve been browsing all the usual sites: Batdongsan, Chotot, Homedy, etc.

But here’s the thing: the prices on those sites just don’t feel right. Some listings have stayed up for *months* with no changes, some prices seem super inflated, and then others are suspiciously low. It’s hard to tell what’s real and what’s just bait to get your attention.

Here’s what I’ve noticed or found out:

* A lot of listings are outdated or already sold, but they’re left up to attract leads.
* Some agents intentionally list fake or low prices to get you to call them.
* The same property can be listed by multiple agents with different photos, descriptions, and even totally different prices.
* Vietnam doesn’t have a public MLS (Multiple Listing Service) like in the U.S., so there’s no official way to verify the actual transaction price unless you know someone on the inside.

Has anyone else run into this?

* How do y’all verify prices when buying from overseas?
* Are there any trusted agents or platforms you recommend?
* Or is this just how the real estate game works in VN?

1jspkzy,reddit,Does hospice care in Vietnam exist?,"My mother in law (MIL) is sick with cancer and most likely going to die in the next few months. The doctor said operating to remove the tumor would probably make her die sooner because she is weak and old. She is in pain and is suffering. In the west we have hospice care, where morphine can be administered orally throughout the day, to ease the suffering of the patient. My wife asked the doctor about it and he doesn't seem to understand. He thinks we mean injecting morphine. He's suggesting my MIL get in a taxi, come to his office once a day and get a morphine shot. The shot would only last a few hours. This is not an option, we need the oral morphine to administer hospice care, at her house while she is on her deathbed. 

So the question is: does this sort of thing exist in Vietnam? The doctor doesn't seem to understand.",2025-04-06 08:35:38,VietNam,VietNam,news,News,[],0,9,13,,0.85,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1jspkzy/does_hospice_care_in_vietnam_exist/,Electrical-Most-4938

1jn9pdr,reddit,Solo Ha Giang Loop (March 2025 Update),"I just finished the loop a few days ago. Here’s my experience summed up in one post for those who want the most up-to-date and complete information.

I won’t go into much detail about the loop itself or which routes to take, as that’s been covered by hundreds of blog posts. Just this: Do the loop counterclockwise. Most tours go clockwise, so going the other way gives you a better chance of having roads and spots to yourself.

How Experienced Do You Have to Be?

While researching, I found many sources claiming the roads are terrible and that you need to be an experienced driver. While bad roads exist, if you stick to the main ones, it really shouldn’t be a problem. If you’ve never ridden a motorbike before, you’re probably better off ~~overpaying~~ booking an Easy Rider. But if you have some experience, I’d say go for it—you’ll have the time of your life.

For me, this was my first major motorbike tour. I had plenty of experience riding scooters in Southeast Asia but very little with semi-automatics. Since you’ll need one for the loop, I practiced for a day in Da Nang, which helped a lot.

Getting There

Ha Giang (the start and end point of the loop) is about a 6-hour bus ride from Hanoi. I booked a ticket online a few hours in advance on a random bus website. I recommend taking a late morning bus, so you arrive in the evening with enough time to find a place to stay, rent a bike, and ease into it.

Packing

Pack as light as possible. Most hostels/hotels allow you to leave your main bag behind. It gets cold, so pack accordingly—I underestimated this and caught a cold on day 2.

Getting a Bike

You’ll find bikes for rent everywhere in Ha Giang. If you have a preference, do some research and message rental shops on WhatsApp in advance. I went with a Honda Future 125cc—a classic choice that gets the job done.

I don’t have a valid international driver’s license, so some places wouldn’t rent to me. However, I do have a Thai license, which is valid in Vietnam, though some shops still didn’t accept it. Ultimately, I had no trouble finding a rental. If you plan to rent without a proper license, bring cash. Which brings me to the next point...

Traffic Police & Fines

If you’re riding without a valid license:

Small bikes → fines up to 3M VND

Big bikes → fines up to 9M VND

I met a guy with a big bike and a valid license who got stopped almost every day. It seems police target big bikes because of the higher fines. In general, traffic stops are random, usually in small villages along main roads.

Some people never got stopped, while others did a few times. I passed four police checkpoints and got stopped once on day 2. They asked where I was from, I showed my Thai license, and that was it. Still, I kept some cash in my back pocket just in case.

My take on this: If you’re riding illegally in Southeast Asia, you’re accepting the risk (e.g., no insurance coverage). Just pay up and move on—it’s basically a road tax. Also, if you get fined, you’ll receive a receipt, meaning you won’t be fined again on the same trip.

5 Days vs. 4 Days (vs. 3 Days)

You can do the loop in three days, but where’s the fun in that? My girlfriend and I took our time and did 5 days. The best roads are away from the main routes, so if you can, set aside extra time to explore.

Have a rough plan but stay flexible—if you see a cool road or hear about a great route from someone at your homestay, go for it. Just be prepared for some rough roads, which can actually make for the best memories.

Homestays & Hotels

There are plenty of cool places to stay—and a lot of extremely dull ones. Do your research and book what suits you. We usually booked one day in advance via Booking, which worked smoothly.

Try to avoid places where big tour groups go—unless you enjoy drunk 21-year-olds singing the same 10 karaoke songs every night. Most of the spots we stayed at had other solo travelers doing the loop, so we met great people along the way.

We're also having fun with fun variants like Lolcat, Upside Down English, and Pirate English. While Java Edition supports around 130 languages, Bedrock only has 29. Why? Because Java relies on community translations, while Bedrock hires “professional” companies—who sometimes make some hilarious mistakes (like translating “Cherry Hanging Sign” as “Cherry Execution Sign” in Korean!).
Chúng tôi cũng đang thử nghiệm những biến thể ngôn ngữ vui nhộn như Lolcat, Tiếng Anh lộn ngược, và Tiếng Anh Cướp biển. Trong khi phiên bản Java hỗ trợ khoảng 130 ngôn ngữ, Bedrock chỉ có 29.

1jpkd4b,reddit,I plan to move to Vietnam. Need advice.," 

I’m planning my move to Vietnam. I will fly to HCMC in mid to late August with a 25kg suitcase and a 7kg backpack, this is almost certainly the only concrete confirmed part of the plan. Where things begin differing is later down the line, and I’m just looking for thoughts on what I have below.

 

Plan 1: Settle in HCMC for a few days, put suitcase in storage for 2 weeks and travel north towards Hanoi for the big National Day parade.

After fly back to HCMC, and find an Air BnB for all of September and October, into mid November, and just see how life is like in HCMC for those 2+ months.

Mid-Nov the 90 day Visa I use to enter Vietnam will be near it’s end.  Timing wise though it could be perfect, as in mid-November there’s some things I really want to do in Thailand and Laos for about 2 weeks. So I’d go to the two and fly back into Vietnam late November, now allowed to stay for a further 90 day. This would be when I start to look for work, which I realise is one of the worst times to look but that’s just how it is and I’d hope to find something, but if not I plan to leave for Vietnam with £10,000 in my bank account so this should go a long way before it needs to be replenished (but I do plan on doing so and saving above that, and also truly understand just how quickly money can go especially with a few mishaps, luckily I have that money and stable family situation if anything truly bad happened ), and should allow me to be jobless for at least a couple months from the time of departing. I suppose then I’d just have to address the situation further down the line. For this plan I would probably need to have the documents to get hired notarised whilst I am in Vietnam, but I do have people back home who can assist.

 

 

Plan 2: Arrive in HCMC and start applying for jobs, or have already applied/ hired. Then I would be working in September and October, rather than lounging around HCMC I’d be working and earning, but almost certainly not chilling so much and possibly also being quite stressed. I would have had the documents to get hired notarised in advance in this plan,

However, I would still want to at least fulfil the plan I have in Thailand, at least, so is it common for TEFL teachers in language centres to be able to take time off in Vietnam? The info online is always different. To clarify, I would not care in the slightest if this is unpaid time off – that’s always been fine with me. I also fully intend on being hired by ILA, so anyone with specific ILA related info that’s be perfect. Would it be easy enough to take 4/5 days off to go to Thailand for a big occasion. Then I would plan to come back and work the rest of November, into December and onward.

It may seem drastic not working for 2/3 months maybe more just to be able to go on this trip, but I think I put as much importance in making the most of my time in Asia. As much as I want to advance my career, start earning and saving, I’m also still young and want to experience things, and the money can come back later.

I’m not sure which scenario/plan would be better for me personally trying to settle into a new situation abroad, getting straight to work or allowing time to settle in, even if that is 3-4 months, with periods of travel possible whenever. I also picture this as being a time to get used to life, the heat, make some connections/friends, find places I like, joining clubs, etc.  I tend to think I lean towards this; concerns would be money going out and nothing coming in. This doesn’t seem too big an isusue, like I said earlier I plan to have £10k and also I could technically do bits of online teaching English. The other concern would be having TOO much time on my hands, and a lack of a proper ‘adult’ routine, which can be bad for me.

I also did spend 2 months in Vietnam 7 years ago on an internship and remember getting like really down on the fact that I was sitting in an office doing work (and actually sometimes even worse not doing anything, so literally sat there for no reason), whilst the country I had dreamed of coming to passed me by outside. Maybe it will be good for me to just have a lot of spare time to do all the things I couldn’t do then, and even that I never got to in my recent trip.

During his leadership, Anh Giac made significant contributions to the establishment of revolutionary government in the local area and actively participated in the resistance against French colonialism. He was known as a visionary and determined leader who played a key role in the early development of the revolutionary movement in southern Vietnam during the early stages of the resistance war.

Nguyen Van Giac sacrificed his life for the revolutionary cause and became a symbol of the fighting spirit of the people in southern Vietnam in the early years of the resistance against the French.

I'm a pretty okay drinker though, and I'll take shots of soju but that's factory made. So I was wondering if the homemade stuff is safe like is there any bacteria that could harm me.

1k0cfh6,reddit,Rent hike of 50%,"I wanted to extend my rental for an extra month and the landlord said it would be no problem. We have made the same arrangement last month. However, this time he said the price will be different, I asked how much and he's raised the price by 50%! I said I won't pay that much and I'll find a new apartment and he said he'd drop the price as I've been a loyal tennant. Now it's an increase of 33%.

It's just pissed me off, I always pay on time, early if he asks for it and I've been a great tennant. Is it normal for prices to rise by this much? I'm pretty much stuck because I intend to leave the country soon so finding an apartment on that short of a time frame is difficult and probably not worth the stress of moving. 

He's a pretty terrible landlord anyway so I should of expected it. The money isn't really the problem it's more the fact I feel like I'm being taken advantage of.

I'm a vietnamese learner of several months. And I mess up words a lot because they sound so similar to me.

For example the words ""Cây,cay,cam,chay,chua, ăn chai"" really give me a hard time. Especially since they all are related to food.

And sometimes it gets really embarrassing. I wanted to give a compliment to the one girl I've met. She had very beautiful earrings.

But instead of saying ""khuyên tai em rất đẹp""  (or smth like that) I've messed up the words khuyên tai and khoai tây. So I've said ""your potatoes are very beautiful"". 

She didn't give me a hint that I've said something wrong. And continued chatting. But when I came back home, checked my vocabulary and realized what I've said - I felt so ashamed. I hope I didn't hurt her with my words unintentionally.

Vietnam is in a great position to make some bs deal. There is very little overlap between the production of the two countries and the economics heavily favor a high trade deficit with Vietnam regardless of tariff levels. 

What this means is Vietnam is in the position the to “lower” its tariffs in a largely immaterial way and offer an unenforceable agreements to “buy” US goods.

1jnbrnh,reddit,Ha giang loop,"I just got done solo riding the ha giang loop, and I have seen a lot of differing advice on here so I’m hoping to shed some light on how it was.

I have experience riding motorcycles but I’d say I’m solidly beginner/intermediate. I hadn’t ridden in many years, but was hoping I’d bounce right back into it. The first day was the hardest for me. There was a lot of traffic coming out of ha giang, and a lot of hairpin turns with heavy traffic was daunting. However after awhile it became normal, and I grew more confident. I took it slow around corners and felt perfectly safe. IMO if you go slow enough there’s not much to worry about.

Doing it solo I got passed by a lot of groups on easy-riders. This seems like a good option if you don’t know how to use a motorbike, or have confidence in yourself and skills. However, I saw a lot where there was no back on the bike and people were clutching the back of the seat behind them to stabilize themselves. The groups rode really fast, and I saw injuries of riders afterwards (none bad, mostly foot issues, and I didn’t see any in person). 

A lot of folks were pressured into getting easy riders that do know how to ride to help navigate the police checkpoints. Even if they had valid licenses. This wasn’t my experience. I got my bike from QT motorbike tours, and they checked my license and gave me my bike. It was that simple.

I did get stopped at the first checkpoint. As an American, the IDP is not valid, due to a difference in the date. The idp license does not state this, and I don’t believe this is true for elsewhere in Vietnam (still not 100% sure but when I rented in Sapa it was adequate) I fully believe they stopped me because I was clearly a foreigner (other people went through the checkpoint but I was confused and stopped). The guy really had it out for me, and it was very clear to me it was a complete racket. I got no formal ticket, but a date on a pamphlet and he said I’d be good for the rest of the trip. He tried to get me to go to an atm and leave my passport behind, tried to say he would search me and my bag (not allowed). When I refused he let me go with a 50.00 usd “fine”.

My friends got stopped twice a bit behind me. They had a similar situation but as soon as the one called his Vietnamese wife they let him go. It seemed clear they did not want outsiders to know this is the situation. Their fine amount was also different.

After the first day we did not see anymore checkpoints. It was honestly an incredible trip, and the fuss about the checkpoint was easily wiped away with how amazing everything else was. I wouldn’t let that deter anybody from riding solo. I think it also helped I did have a license I GENUINELY THOUGHT was valid and had backups to my license I hold. From what the locals said it was also a negative that I am a woman. I’m not quite sure why, but that seemed to be the consensus.

The accommodations around the loop were incredible, and getting into town before the easy riders (about 2-4pm each day) made it easy to find good, cheap accommodations with time to explore the town!",2025-03-30 12:53:26,VietNam,VietNam,news,News,[],0,7,4,,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1jnbrnh/ha_giang_loop/,Pale_Anxiety_635

I just want to address the benefits that Vietnamese culture can teach us, especially coming from different community. Just some that I've noticed:

- As a pedestrian, people are (usually) looking out for you. You just need to walk in your own path, and motorcyclists will go around you. 
- People are always inviting and welcoming, especially to homes. It's a belief that the more guests you have, the more blessed you'll be, because no one wants to visit a lousy neighbor. So be a good neighbor :)
- If you need or want something, all you need to do is ask. Being an introvert def makes things a bit harder, but you just got to raise your voice whenever you need something.
- Vietnamese people have a ""get it done"" mentality. If you need something done, it'll get done. How they do it, can be questionable, but the job will get done regardless.

""Phan Thanh Gian (1796–1867), a great official of the Nguyen Dynasty, was known for his upright, determined, and loyal nature, and his integrity earned him great respect.""

Phan Thanh Gian (1796–1867) was one of the prominent ministers of the Nguyen dynasty, known for his integrity, courage, and upright character. He made a significant mark on Vietnamese history. Born in Tan Thanh village, Ben Tre province, he became the first Confucian doctor from Southern Vietnam and played an important role in politics and diplomacy.

He represented Emperor Tu Duc in signing a treaty with France to protect Vietnamese territory, and his diplomatic efforts helped recover Vinh Long province. Despite criticism for these decisions, Phan Thanh Gian remained steadfast in his loyalty to the country. When faced with insurmountable political pressures and the French military advance, he ultimately took his own life to demonstrate his loyalty to his emperor and homeland.

Phan Thanh Gian’s legacy endures as a symbol of loyalty, integrity, and patriotism during a tumultuous period in Vietnam’s history.

I quickly packed my things and got on a taxi 10 mins later. Then my data sim card died right afterward and I had to borrow the driver's phone just to get internet access. It was a horrible situation, my parents was gonna kill me if I missed the plane and I was so worried that even the driver was concern. Guess what, Vietjet came down like an angle and sent an email that they would delay the flight by an hour while I was half way to the airport. When I reached the terminal another delay all the way to 4:15. At that point I was happily excepting waiting lmao. I managed to board the plane at 5pm and had to wait an extra half an hour to take off. The end.

  
TLDR: I was surely gonna missed my flight, got into trouble, then VIetjet forced everyone to wait an 2 hours and 30 mins as margin for error and saved my sleepy ass lmao.

“Nguyễn Sáng (1923–1988) was a famous painter from Tiền Giang.”

Nguyễn Sáng, born in 1923 in Tiền Giang, rose to prominence as one of Vietnam’s most celebrated painters. His work reflected the history and culture of the nation, deeply rooted in the revolutionary struggles of the time. Renowned for his mastery of lacquer and oil painting, he created iconic works like “Party Admission at Điện Biên Phủ,” “The Enemy Burned My Village,” and “Young Girl by the Lotus.” Through these pieces, he captured the resilience and spirit of the Vietnamese people.

Beyond painting, Nguyễn Sáng contributed to Vietnam’s cultural identity by designing the country’s first postage stamps and pioneering a modern approach to traditional art forms. In recognition of his contributions, he was posthumously awarded the Hồ Chí Minh Prize, and several of his works are considered national treasures. His legacy endures not just in museums but in the continuing influence he has on generations of Vietnamese artists.
