mlck5he,1jr7zgf,reddit,"I’d say you got what you were after! 

My best story is I booked my sad-girl trip to Paris one year and on the first morning there I got picked up by a hot Sorbonne professor in a used bookshop in the 10th Arrondissement and he ended up giving me a tour of that part of the city. Except he spoke only French and Spanish, while I had at the time just English and German and a smattering of French, so I spent the day wracking my brain to understand him. 

He wanted to meet up again the next day but I wanted the trip not to be about a guy so I didn’t call him.",2025-04-04 09:50:19,675,ZweitenMal,travel

mlegl6z,1jr7zgf,reddit,"What seems like a lifetime ago, I lived down in Central TX (Killeen for the ones who would know 🙄) and had a similar situation. I had just moved in, and was at the mailboxes (the development was broken up into quadrants and each one had its own area with a big “bank” of mailboxes) and got to chatting with one of the neighbors. She informs me that her family is having a cookout, and that I should swing by. 

Normally I’m an incredibly reserved person and would never lol but I had moved from Maryland to Texas to live with my best friend at the time while he was in the Army who then went back home for a visit a week after discharge and just kinda never returned, so I just moved out (since technically I was never actually on the lease 😂). Due to this and my reluctance to return home with my tail tucked, and also I was getting the vibe that she was into me so I said fuck it and decided to go. 

I waited about an hour after the time she told me that it started and headed out the door and started walking. I then realized that I never got the address (I was incredibly shy and had low self esteem back then, I was not great at communicating effectively with women especially if they showed even an ounce of interest lmao), just the general street that I saw her walk back down so I just started walking in that direction. About halfway down that street I heard the loudest party sounds I’d ever heard and figured that was the place so I walked into the backyard and started scanning around for the woman that had invited me.

After a few minutes, I realized that not only do I not see her, but I’m the only white person in this yard. Literally everyone else is very obviously of some sort of Spanish-speaking lineage. I start asking for Maria in what little Spanish I remember from high school and I’m met with about 100 confused looks when they hear my awful Spanish, followed by them pointing at one of about 25 different women at that party named Maria. At one point a man with a comically large cowboy hat and belt buckle shoved a 24oz Modelo in my hand when asked where Maria was, so once again I said fuck it I’m already here so I sat down to enjoy my beer and just take it all in. 

A few moments later, an elderly woman sits down with me and in English as broken as my Spanish asks who I am, who I’m looking for, etc. so I tell her my story. She starts laughing hysterically and calls over at least a dozen other Abuelitas and tells them my story, to which they all respond similarly. She comes back after they all chat a bit, and tells me that the family I’m looking for lives on the next street over. Apparently I saw her walk down this street bc she was on her way to this literal house to wish a happy 15th birthday to the girl that lived here.

Now I’m the first to admit that I was extremely naive to  a lot of traditions of other cultures (still am, but I’ve been actively trying to learn and expand what I know of cultures other than my own) but I knew how big of a deal that was and I was immediately mortified. I just barged into some girls fucking QUINCEÑERA, and I’m just sitting there like I belong with a beer in my hand and I’m sure the most curious mix of utter embarrassment and shame on my face. 

The Abuelitas all assured me it was fine I was there and insisted that I eat some of the food and have more beer and tequila. The food was some of the best I’ve ever had, and to this day I’ve never seen that brand of tequila on a store shelf here in the states but it converted me into a tequila fan for life. I ended up having a great time, made some great friends in the area for the rest of the time I was living there, and the father actually walked with me over to the party I was originally supposed to attend and introduced me as the gringo that crashed his daughters Quinceñera to many appalled faces until he very rapidly in Spanish explained what happened. I do have to say, I admire how quickly and efficiently they seem to be able to say everything that needs to be said 😂. Stayed at the second party til the sun came up the next day and made even more friends.

mldggte,1jr7zgf,reddit,"Honestly, you did exactly what you set out to do. Life changing experiences don't feel that way when they happen. You realize later how important it was. 


You discovered the most important lesson of all: that life is about authenticity and connection. That the best times we will have are when we are connecting with other people. That people are generally good, and open, and opening yourself up to them shouldn't be feared. 


You learned we don't need to be afraid of new people and experiences. Not every experience will be great, but every great experience starts with a greeting and a smile. 


You learned that other people are looking for that connection too, and they are delighted to find it and nurture it. I guarantee everyone at that wedding was just as happy to see you there and get to meet you. They'll be talking about the stranger that ended up at the wedding for years, and it will be a fond memory. 


Life is what happens when we deviate from the plan; and it is often so much better, and messier, and more fulfilling than what we THINK we should be doing. 


Congratulations on finding yourself. You showed kindness to another, and then you were willing to open yourself up to that connection. In turn, you found yourself surrounded by new friends. 


This tells me a lot about you. 😊 And it was absolutely the best way to start healing. ",2025-04-04 13:46:48,9,RogueConformist486,travel

I cannot tell you how many people roped me into their family photos for some unknown reason.    I found India loud, colorful, crowded, rich, poor, frenetic and peaceful.  It is the sort of place that requires total immersion.  Anything less will not yield a love match.  I would caution against planning a hermetically sealed trip that focuses on western hotels, private tours, etc.  You will miss the best of India if you take that route.  I was extremely fortunate to arrange a couple of meetings with Indians before I left home.  One happened by chance through LinkedIn.  I answered a question to which an Indian man responded.  He ended up introducing me to several folks in Mumbai who became my local friends.  All of them were excited to share aspects of the culture with me.  Rashi took me shopping and threw a party for me.  Ronan took me for a food tour of Bandra that culminated in dinner at a Parsi restaurant.  Mohit took me shopping and on to a pre-wedding celebration held on a rooftop surrounded by swaying palms.  When I contracted pneumonia and developed a pneumothorax, Mohit took me to his doctor and came to see me everyday while I was in the hospital.  He is still a dear friend.  Sumit made sure I made it safely to the airport in my weakened state.  I met a group of women through a shared love of fiber arts.  Three of them took me shopping and showered me with small gifts over an afternoon of knitting together.  Another knitter asked me to come to her home for dinner, later revising the invitation to include having me as a house guest and showing me things I would never have seen about her region had I been the typical tourist.  The human connections I was blessed to make with Indians and the things they were generous enough to share with me were hands down the best parts of my trip.    Some not great things happened as well.  I expect that with any long trip but they were far and away eclipsed by the wonderful experiences I had seeing not only the typical sites, but the things Indians were proud to show me.

mlhhg8h,1jrf8zn,reddit,"I’d like to add a perspective on why the staring exists. 

1. Even amongst/within Indian people, some people will often stare out of curiosity if they see something different. The “it’s rude to stare” etiquette somehow wasn’t ingrained into the psyche of people so when they see something that is unexpected, as opposed to a quick glance they will just stare. 

2. Combined with #1 above, most small town Indians have rarely seen or interacted with someone “non Indian” or of a different skin color than theirs.  So their curiosity is at 100% (who is this person, what are they doing here, do they speak like me, wow their hair is different etc etc).

Of course unfortunately there is a #3 for women travelers which is that there are certainly some shitty men out there who are thinking bad thoughts BUT I would say by and large in most cases it is curiosity rather than bad intentions ",2025-04-05 03:13:22,11,humptheedumpthy,travel

Yes, people are like that here. If you go on Indian subs, you will see Indians ranting about similar things.


But, the problems that you articulate are drastically milder in the southern part of India and especially in Kerala, where people are relatively more conscious of boundaries.


The Delhi-Agra-Jaipur circuit is strongly marketed in the West and that's because tour companies have a strong network in this area and it also lends to luxury travel, ergo more money for the tour companies.

Visited: Tashkent, Fergana valley, Khiva, drove through the desert to Bukhara, Samarkand, Shahrisabz.

I got quite a few stares from men as a young woman in Fergana (the more conservative area of the country) but beyond that everyone was extremely friendly and polite almost to a fault. The country was a lot more developed for tourism than I’d expected, some areas even pretty touristy. Tashkent felt quite Soviet with the wide roads and USSR-style statues. 

My favourite places were Khiva (it’s drop-dead gorgeous, not much else needs to be said), Shah-i-Zinda and, predictably, Afrasiyab (it was the place I was most excited to see) and the Observatory of Ulugbek, but one needs a bit of historical context to appreciate those last two (English signs are lacking even in the museums). Plus the train ride from Tashkent to Fergana and drive down to Shahrisabz. That drive had some autumn leaves but also reminded me strangely of driving through Spain with family when I was younger.

While most of the more impressive monuments are in Samarkand and Bukhara, and Khiva was very photogenic, I have to say that Fergana is where I felt I got to know what the country was like outside of the more touristy areas. From the train one could see stork nests on the tips of electric poles, houses more like shacks but with intricate wooden doors, teenagers all in black and white uniforms on their way to school, a billboard advertising air-conditioners in the middle of the desert, donkey-pulled carts, street dogs and cows with birds on their backs next to the tracks (all over the country, cows are left to their own devices but have a rope around their neck tied to a stake in the ground, so they have only a little circular piece of freedom). In Kokand I found myna birds, a wedding, trees painted white, smiles of golden teeth, a car wash using extremely pink soap, squat toilets, wasps with yellow bums, three boys on a motorbike—clearly not old enough to have a license—and bus-vans. One van so covered in dust that they’d simply written the line number on the back window by hand. 

That was the Uzbekistan I wanted to see and get to know, and felt it was harder to experience in the other areas I went to. However, a lot of that could be found by going outside the Khiva walls and walking around town—the area where people actually live—if Fergana feels far away. On the way to Bukhara I asked the driver to stop at some cotton fields when a good spot came up, so we got to see some from close up too, next to a cow with her stake.

Overall, it was a very interesting country. I think I spent so much time going wow-wow-wow that I couldn’t take it all in. There were so many details to look at and enjoy that it simply became overwhelming after a while. As such, I must say I would like to revisit some day…",2025-03-29 18:33:16,226,NotACaterpillar,travel

mmjtu2z,1jvc0fs,reddit,"Not really much of a breakfast culture here. I hear Farm House offers a nice brunch. Armazéns do Congumbreiro and Confeitaria a Colmeia are nice as well. At Colmeia make sure you get a nata. They aren’t as special as some places in the mainland, but the best here for me. I usually fo there and have a galão, a sandes mista em pão da avó com manteiga and a nata.
For dinner:
Fish - borda d’água or bar a caloura (outside Ponta Delgada both, but the best for me) and in Ponta Delgada you have o bom pesqueiro
Meat - if you like steak, must try one “à regional”. In Ponta Delgada recommend Aliança (my favorite). Outside Ponta Delgada maybe Associação Agrícola. It has gotten quite touristy, but the sauce never disapoints.
General- recommend O Silva, in Ribeira Grande. The Arroz de Tamboril is very nice, and it is my recommendation to try the shellfish (lapas, cracas and camarão cozido)
Typical- cozido à portuguesa when you go to Furnas, where they make it underground. I like going to Miroma
Fancy/pricy. Otaka is the number one fine dining place, the tasting menu is quite great. Tasquinha Vieira also very nice
Others: herdade do ananas (get the arroz de peixe or the tuna), arco 8, petiscaria o calheta

Other recommendations;

To eat, make reservations
You need a car
This might be a very personal opinion, but a lot of places that will be highly recommended in trip advisor to me are really not worth it (a tasca, taberna açor, forneria são dinis…to name a few) - again, this might be very personal, as my wife often says I am very picky with restaurants, but if you like food, and I like food, you will understand what I mean.
Food can be very good, as Portuguese food is, but can be very tricky as consistency is not the name of the game unfortunately
Try to be flexible and before you go check the weather through spot azores which has webcams around the island and you can see if a place is worth visiting or if it is foggy
The weather is a bit unpredictable here when it comes to rain - furnas, for example, is not a bad destination on a cloudy day.

We just got back from Bhutan yesterday. We left from Paro airport ( currently the only international airport) 


11 night is total were spent across the following areas. 


Thimphu to Punakha to Phobjikha valley to Paro.


The whole experience was a great mixture of culture, relaxation and nature with lots of hikes. Both of us are not into hiking back home, so we both went hiking every weekend for 3 months before our trip. Definitely a must as some of these walks are above 3000m and we could the difference. 


All the people were lovely warm and trustworthy. They always asked if this was our first time and how we heard about Bhutan. It was a fair question, as most of the people at work had heard of it but didn't know where it was. 


They also said to spread the word. So here I am HIGHLY RECOMMEND GOING TO BHUTAN. 


It's expensive but it's one of those bucket list places that should be ticked off if you can afford it. 


The only thing I would change if we went again would be the timing. There were quiet a few forrest fires around due to it being so dry. This made visibility limiting at times. You can probably see it in the photos.  A better time to go would be in August or September I think.

""Tiger's Nest Monastery (Paro Taktsang)

Clinging to the sheer cliff face before you is one of Buddhism's most sacred sites – Paro Taktsang, commonly known as the Tiger's Nest Monastery. Perched 3,000 feet above Bhutan's Paro Valley, this remarkable complex seems to defy gravity itself.

Legend tells us that in the 8th century, the Buddhist master Guru Rinpoche flew here on the back of a tigress to meditate in a cave. The tigress was actually a manifestation of his consort, and after three years, three months, three weeks, three days, and three hours of meditation, he emerged to subdue local demons and establish Buddhism in Bhutan.

The monastery we see today was built in 1692 around the sacred meditation cave. Though devastated by fire in 1998, it was painstakingly rebuilt to its original specifications using traditional methods and materials — a testament to Bhutan's commitment to its cultural heritage.

The complex consists of four main temples and residential shelters, each dedicated to different aspects of Buddhist practice. For centuries, pilgrims have made the challenging trek to reach this sacred site, climbing steep paths and stone staircases. Even today, every Bhutanese hopes to visit at least once in their lifetime. The journey itself is considered part of the spiritual experience: a physical manifestation of the Buddhist path to enlightenment.

In a nation that measures its success in Gross National Happiness rather than economic output, Tiger's Nest stands as a powerful symbol of Bhutan's spiritual foundations and its unique approach to preserving traditions while cautiously embracing modernity. It reminds us that sometimes the most profound human achievements are those that harmonize with nature rather than conquer it.""

For ‘no show’ to be registered you have to have a valid booking and just not showing up for a flight. For example this is used by people ordering flights going through the hub, not intending to use second leg of the flight because these tickets can be cheaper than direct flight tickets to the same hub. Or peope buying round trip tickets being cheaper than one way ticket and simply not using the return flight. But in your case you had valid delays and reschedules.

mnmos7d,1k1hi3f,reddit,"I'm actually posting this from a hotel room in Istanbul. My girlfriend and I have spent the last four days here, and while we've experienced some scammy behavior, we really can't recognize the OP’s experience. We've had an amazing time and will very likely come back in the near future.

The only issue we've really encountered has been with taxis overcharging or deliberately taking longer routes. Taxis in Istanbul are very cheap (relative to where we're from), so the actual cost was never really a problem. One driver did have a meter already running at 600 TL when we entered, but he reluctantly reset it after we asked. Public transport is really easy to use and extremely cheap, so it’s a great way to avoid taxi-related hassles.

We were also approached by a woman on the street asking for help for her mother, who was in the background appearing to choke. Apparently, she had just had surgery and was unwell — and somehow, the only cure was cash, not an ambulance. Luckily, her condition instantly improved once we kept walking.

In the touristy areas, there are lots of touts trying to sell everything and nothing, but we never experienced anyone who didn’t respect a polite “no.” It’s nothing close to Cairo or similar places. In fairness, though, we didn’t spend much time in those areas — they were too crowded for us — so we went early, saw the sights, and then left.

Istanbul is an amazing city with so many different areas to explore, so I hope people won’t be too put off by the OP’s experience.

How do I try to not be a tourist when I look East Asian and don't speak Turkish?

""Try to go off the beaten path"" - that's like saying go to Rome but do not visit the Vatican. There are many amazing sights in Istanbul, and people come see them for a reason - because they are architectural wonders. They will be touristy.

In my experience, Istanbul is fine for most people, EXCEPT solo female travelers (and especially if you don't look ""local"" eg there are many people who can pass as possibly Turkish, but I'm never going to look Turkish; at best I can pretend to be Muslim Indonesian). The difference between me going with a friend (female) vs going out on my own was astounding. I'm shocked in this day and age, in a country with Turkey's reputation (""modern"", ""European"" - whatever that means) that people still think a female walking down the street on her own must mean asking for an invitation to sleep around.

-Visit the sites, they're tourist sites for a reason. 
-Spend any time you can OUTSIDE of Sultanamet. People are scammy there and we know this so why spend your time there? 
-Spend as much time as possible on the Asian side for a much better and more normal experience with some cool locals
-Avoid the stinking stupid Grand Bazaar. Shop in Eminou or Taksim Square

Check out a menu online and then go in to find the prices tripled. Entrance fees to a mosque, the cistern etc $60 CAD+ per person. My travel partner agreed that for the prices we paid, it would be better spent elsewhere.

Gotha, Thürigen - small town with a gorgeous castle and orangery.
Erfurt, Thüringen - the state capital where city center was almost not destroyed.
Weimar, Thüringen - the real gem. As well as being related to the history of Bauhaus, it also has a lovely centre. Also, Buchenwald concentration camp was 10km from there, the remains of which as well as infamous ""Jedem das seine"" are there.

Those three can be visited in one trip, maybe not in a single day but they are each 20 minutes train ride from each other.

Other ones:

Wiesbaden, Hesse - worth a visit if you are in Frankfurt area; otherwise I wouldn't call it that worthy

Marburg, Hesse - very beautiful city being located in the valley.

Rheinland-Pfalz is very overlooked. It has beautiful castles on Rhein and Mosel, gonna give a visit to Cochem soon. 
This state has also the towns of Speyer, having a gorgeous Dome as well as preserved town centre and Landau which has an interesting architecture.

Rothenburg ob der Tauber was never mentioned but it's somewhat notorious for being a preserved touristic stereotypic German city. Heard that Miltenberg is less touristic, also being an old preserved German city

Passau, 2:30 train ride from Munich, on the border with Austria is also beautiful. I think that all beautiful German cities are located in valleys.

In the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are Schwerin with its castle (becoming UNESCO state only in 2024), and that's the city which is for sure overlooked. There is also Wismar as an example of preserved Hanseatic city.

Lüneburg, Lower Saxony, is also crazy lovely and reachable in one hour from Hamburg.

Ravenna, Italy.  Lots of late Roman / Medieval buildings.  Great streets to wander around.  Interesting Medieval stuff too, including Dante's tomb.  The artwork in some of the churches is amazing.  Its crazy this little town was the capital of western civilization for a good amount of time.  Of course its also a short train ride to Bologna or Venice.  

Thune, Switzerland.  Like I visited Interlaken, an hated it.  It felt like I was wandering through stupid tourists blowing their money.  Thune had lots of cool shops, and a bunch of restaurants built up on a river /canal.  I loved the food, and had some amazing Thai food of all things.  I'm still salivating over truffle week.

mkqkv5v,1jo2yf9,reddit,"I second Tainan and Wroclaw. Freaking incredible and the lack of tourists/travelers really stunned me. Pittsburgh was also really pretty. Here is my list of beautiful cities. I have more, but many others are just gateway towns, and I decided they weren’t interesting enough to make the cut.

Yekaterinburg – A mix of Tsarist Russia, Soviet-era architecture, and modern amenities, Yekaterinburg sits on the border between Asia and Europe and is very affordable. It is extremely underrated. I have never hear of anyone mentioning it except for the few Trans-Siberian travelers who pass through. It’s definitely worth a visit when it is more peaceful.

Kuching – If you’re looking for the best Malaysian or Singaporean food, this should be on your radar. Kuching is easily accessible and offers amenities similar to those in larger regional cities, but it’s much quieter and friendlier. Plus, you can see partially wild orangutans at a nearby reserve. 

Victoria, BC – While everyone talks about Vancouver or Seattle, the most beautiful British-looking city in North America is literally in the same bay. Victoria has fantastic food, friendly people, and world-class museums. It’s not exactly underrated, but I know many people in the PNW who have never visited.

Kanazawa/Toyama – Many of the underrated cities actually make it to the NYT’s annual ""Top 52 Places to Visit"". I took a bullet train along the west coast of Honshu instead of the usual Kyoto-Tokyo route, and was pleasantly surprised by how quiet and charming the area is. It’s full of amenities and delicious food, and we visited a few museums where we were the only visitors that day.

Dresden – Is Dresden underrated? I’m not sure, but it doesn’t seem to be a popular destination, so I’m including it. It has incredible museums (the Green Vault rivals Louvre/Hermitage), lots of Communist-era architecture, delicious food, and very affordable. Moreover it is easy to access beautiful landscapes/castles and into nearby countries.",2025-03-31 19:36:36,3,bo_tew,travel

- Milwaukee, Wisconsin is way underrated. Mid-sized industrial city with a thriving food, beer, art, and music scene. Plus it’s a half days drive to the upper peninsula of Michigan which is divine. Quick jaunt to Chicago too. 

- Duluth, Minnesota is another one. It’s a small city, so it’s clean and easy to get around - but has a state college so it’s got a great vibrant energy and music scene. Main draw IMO: access to boundary waters canoe area. 

I know people would put Minneapolis/St. Paul on the list on of great Midwest cities so I will too. Super green, tons of lakes and public green space, good food scene. St Paul is a little more historic/industrial and Mpls more cosmopolitan, in general. 

Honestly though if you visit the Midwest and you sleep on the MN/WI/MI northwoods - you’ve missed the heart of what the region has to offer. Even if you’re not outdoorsy there are some great, vibey little artists towns along Lake Superior/Michigan.

There are 500 different sites/boats/options and every single one is different.  Whatever you book, then they sometimes combine people on the same boat.  Our boat was told ""some of you are 3 day 2 night, some are 2 days, 1 night.""  Because of this, we were often split up for activities.  Like the 3 day people get to go ride kayaks for 90 minutes but the 2 day people get to stay on the boat and enjoy ""relax time.""  WTF  Then I started talking with other 3 days people and we all had different itineraries, and paid different prices to different people.  We (friend and I) were suppose to have a ""premium dinner"" but it was the same thing everyone, 3 day and 2 day, was eating.  When I asked them about this their answer, LOL, still makes me laugh thinking about it: ""Oh, you get mountain chicken, they get city chicken.""  Yeah, he was trying to say free range vs farm raised, like they we really made the same dinner dish with two variances of chicken, and kept it separate, while ON A BOAT!  But wait, there's more!  At one point the 2 day people got to go to a beach, while us 3 day people got a cooking class.  We said we wanted to go to the beach instead.  They said no.  We put up a serious verbal fight, arguing, and they finally let us go to the beach for 2 hours.  Still more!  So our 3 day itinerary had 1-2 things on it that never happened.  It was booked via a ""travel agent"" in Hanoi.  Well we decided to text her via whatsapp and let her know they were not providing what we paid for.

I ran back to the plane but was not let past a certain point and while I stood in line at the Air France desk, the plane took off back to the us. I was then led to a cell where I spent a couple of long hours with other folks not allowed into France for different reasons. Meanwhile my wife and the kids were talking to everybody they could to figure out if they could find my documents. At some point I was told I was going to be denied entry into France and sent back to the US. After a while a police officer came and got me and told me my passport had been found but not my green card and they were going to let me into the country. I was reunited with my family and spent the next couple of weeks on vacation. I had to apply for a ‘boarding foil’ at the us embassy in Paris. After a couple of weeks in France and Italy, my boarding foil - which is a one time document to enter the us - was not ready yet, and my wife and kids flew home. I stayed in France for another 10 days while the boarding foil was approved. It was probably the single most stressful event of my life. It was made worse by being a LPR instead of a US citizen. After all that waiting I picked up my passport from the embassy and convinced Air France to send me back home using the original ticket without additional payment. I have to say the French police had zero attitude about it, and my wife was a saint for not wanting to divorce me after this. She carries passports wherever we go now.

mm90oq3,1jvavr4,reddit,"Short answer: people visit Denver when they really want a place like Boulder, Estes Park, Manitou, or Golden. 

Long answer: Like others have said, covid really decimated downtown Denver. It has struggled to come back, and a lot of businesses are struggling due to numerous issues. Turnover is very high. Lodo is essentially the bar district of the downtown area and is where I would send 24 year olds. 

Denver is heavily neighborhood based, meaning each neighborhood has a somewhat unique identity. Cherry Creek is bougie/Dallas-esque, Rino is the arts/brewery district, South Broadway is dive bars, Federal/Aurora have the diverse food scenes, etc. But most of the neighborhoods are where people actively live and work and aren’t really designed to support a ton of tourists. 

So to that extent, I think one should plan out a trip to Denver based on travel guides and recommendations that align with your interests. Denver is a relatively new city and doesn’t have the amenities to support a central tourist district in a way a bigger city does. Also not to beat a dead horse but most people use Denver as the base camp for seeing other parts of the state.

mm8vwl9,1jvavr4,reddit,"I live in Denver and love it, so I can offer my perspective. Denver is a city of neighborhoods. If you just visited LoDo, you missed out on the majority of Denver. During the summer, there are tons of markets and festivals to visit, and they take place along different areas. Historically, there were a lot of neighborhoods built around street cars. These no longer exist, but they make up some of the more walkable areas like Platt Park, Wash Park, Cap Hill, Tennyson, etc. these areas tend to have more restaurants, events, or stores. 

Denver also has interesting roots. It was very much a wild west town, so you can find a lot of cool historical tours, art, and museums focused on western history, indigenous populations, and cowboy shit. The Western Stock show is a huge deal when it runs in the winter. There was and still is a significant Hispanic population in Denver, so if you're in what was previously known as Denver's Northside (along the Federal Blvd corridor) or near Aurora, you run into super great food and more interesting events/art. Aurora and Federal in general have a ton of great food because different ethnic populations have been in that area. 

This is also a passionate sports city if you're into sports. We have all major professional teams, and some of them are even good. They just purchased a women's soccer league expansion, which will start playing next year and have a new stadium built by 2027. 

There's also some strong subcultures and communities in the area! For the nerds, you can play DnD and boardgames in a lot of different places, there are independent bookstores and reading groups, LARPers, an entire pirate cosplay organization, Renaissance festival enthusiasts and more. There's a local Pro Wrestling circuit. There's a strong drag and queer scene. There's a great kink community. Lots of music enthusiasts and scenes because we have great venues. Like, if you are passionate about anything, there's an active group for it in Denver.

And obviously, people like nature. Within the city, there are lots of parks, the botanic gardens, arboretums with champion trees, open spaces with hiking, biking infrastructure, state parks...

If you're going to the same instagram-ready restaurants for white people who have a handlebar moustache, drink beer, and think a Patagonia vest over a T-shirt is fashion....

mmbw7ej,1jvavr4,reddit,"Born and raised in Denver and people always try and compare it to other much larger cities like New York and Chicago, especially in terms of food and downtown “life”. LoDo is really only good for overpriced bars that people in their early 20’s go to or people go to before or after Rockies game. 

There are tons of other neighborhoods in Denver (platt park, south broadway, Berkeley) that are great to spend time in and have great restaurants. I don’t agree with the “Denver has no good food”. There are tons of restaurants that have great food and service. We may have fewer options and variety than larger cities but that doesn’t mean we have bad food. 

A great day for a visitor in my opinion would be a cup of local coffee, walking around South Broadway and looking at the local shops and antique stores, grabbing a beer or cocktail, and maybe go to a museum. We have really great museums and zoos here, all close to the city with great exhibits. Our performing arts center usually has a good Broadway play and there are tons of creative shops to go to like pottery classes, floral classes, cooking classes, etc.

Most of the time when I travel, I’m traveling. I am experiencing new things, going on long, epic hikes, and exploring big, beautiful cities. We love adventures and we love going to new places and learning about different cultures. We love kicking our own ass in a travel experience and the effort always feels like it’s worth it.

Last year, my husband and I were exhausted. His mom just died and we just needed to wind down somewhere. We ended up booking and all inclusive resort in Mexico and had a blast- because at the time we really didn’t need to climb a mountain. We didn’t need to have awkward conversations in toddler Spanish about directions, try to figure out public transit, or navigate a different country. We need to relax and rest.

Resorts are amazing for families, especially with a large number of small children. They’re great for busy folks who need to wind down and feel like all of their needs are taken care of. The point of a resort is it necessarily to go out and explore, but to have a comfortable place to unwind and not think about anything stressful for a few days. Getting the same experience close to home cannot only be expensive, but make you feel justified in opening your work email, running an errand, etc.

Mental workload management is significantly reduced at an all inclusive.

I spend time organizing, deciding, planning, and doing shit all the time. Most of my life is a logistical challenge at some level. When I go on vacation I don't want to do any of that crap. I just want to be. All inclusive reduce the mental workload where I can actively concentrate on just being, instead of wondering where I'm supposed to be, or what's next, or what's for dinner, or how much that drink cost or any of that crap. I can just be, even for a short few days.

The #1 best thing about being at an all inclusive, the first one I went to. The lack of transactional overhead. I went 4 days without touching my wallet. I wanted a drink I walked up, asked for one, got it and went on my way. No card swipe, no price checking, no signature, no cash, no tipping, all of the BS surrounding all the transactions you make every day just....went away.

Now, we still go other places and ""do"" things. Had an off road trip last weekend. We take weekend camping trips. We travel to other places to see sights, and walk and hike, and ""do"" things.

The second rule for fish and chips is to order it in the most rundown, poverty-stricken town you can find. Don't ask me why, but poorer towns tend to have better fish and chips. In Great Yarmouth, for example, it's excellent. London is literally the other end of the spectrum.

mkzy3sa,1jp2tsw,reddit,"For the artifacts from all over the world in the British Museum, it’s controversial. I knew the British used all kinds of means to move them to the UK, but I was still surprised when I saw them in person. Because they are huge, and many of them are very heavy stones. They cut them into pieces and then reassembled them. That’s a lot of effort to move them.

I'm Chinese, and there's a big room for all the artifacts from China. That's a complicated feeling when you see them in a different country. You not only see the artifacts, but also see the history of China when this country was weak one hundred years ago, and all the Western countries could do whatever they wanted in China at that time.

To be honest, based on what I know, most of the artifacts aren’t stolen or looted. They were “purchased”. Chinese people didn’t know their value, and the government couldn’t do anything to stop the foreign army, so people stole and sold them to foreigners.

I saw many of them are labeled “donated” by some people in the museum. Here’s the full process: some people bought them in China and sold them to private collectors in the UK, and these collectors donated them to the British Museum. It’s a legal process for the museum

There’s a park in Beijing called Yuanmingyuan, which was a palace to keep all the artifacts, and it was destroyed and looted by the foreign army. It still looks the same as when it was destroyed, even though China has the power to rebuild it now. But the government wants everyone to remember the history.

That’s the rule of this world. That’s what happened in history and what happens now. Weak countries don’t have the power to control their fate, just like Ukraine today. These artifacts are valuable, but the history of these artifacts is more valuable.",2025-04-02 09:43:48,10,jason_houdini,travel

1. The construct of time is lost. My life is overly scheduled and I will take a chance to let go when I get it. Why have glass of wine at 5pm while you can drink at 9am in the airport. I like the carefree

2. Growing up, to pass layover time, my family used to play a game called faces. If we saw a happy person everyone would guess why they were happy. Maybe they were coming home, maybe they are going for a trip ( for groups), maybe they were meeting their long distance person etc. If someone looked anxious could be delays, first time travelling.

It's just that business class is much better when compared to the often-hellishness of flying in the back of the plane.

Airport lounges are the same. They are relatively nice compared to the melee of an airport terminal, but they are not especially nice compared to being at home or in a proper restaurant or bar. How could they be? Eating and drinking self-serve in a quiet space is not particularly luxurious or special for most travellers.

mon8t91,1k651sj,reddit,"My use of the lounge has nothing to do with ""guzzling as much free wine as they can.""

Personally, I do not like being rushed at the airport. Being able to take my time, knowing that I have plenty of time to get where I need to be without having to worry about long check in or security lines, weirdness at screening points or any of the the thousand things that can slow you down at the airport is key to keeping my stress level down when I travel.  So I personally tend to arrive at the airport 60 or more minutes prior to departure, with the exact time depending on where and when I'm traveling.

The vast majority of the time, I make it airside and have plenty of time to get to my gate.  And that's why I like having lounge access, because it's more comfortable than sitting at the gate.  The WiFi's better. If something happens with my flight I've got easy and convenient access to an airline agent (because I'm in an airline lounge and not the Priority Pass Lounge) to help me sort things out. The restrooms are cleaner and usually less crowded. And yes, I can grab a snack or more importantly for those early morning flights a decent cup of coffee - for free. At most (but definitely not all) airport lounges it's also calmer and quieter than sitting at the gate. 

Oh, and as an added bonus - when I fly Delta from ORD there's a possibility that I can board the flight DIRECTLY FROM THE LOUNGE! I admit, there's not too many places where that's a perk of lounge access, but when you can take advantage of it it's pretty awesome.

Now that's if you're in the US where gate areas tend to have quite a bit of seating - things are very different at European airports where they don't really encourage passengers to arrive at their gates early.  Again, a lounge is a nice alternative to walking laps through duty free or trying to find a clean table or place to sit in a food court and central waiting area while you wait for the notification that it's time to head to the gate area for boarding.

moojeha,1k651sj,reddit,"The Lounge in airports is not the amazing beacon of awesomeness that people proclaim, unless you have the first class lounges in Asia.

Why do I like the lounge though and arrive 2 hours early. I will pre-empt this by saying im a frequent flyer with work and get it for free.

- You spend a lot less than you would if wondering around the airport. I bring my wife to the lounge as a guest when we fly and we don't have to spend crazy airport prices for food.
- However, the food standard is better around the airport than in the lounge (country dependent)
- Free booze. Im a nervous flyer and a whiskey or more before take off is needed for some flights, particularly if I've had a few rough nights of sleep.
- Lounge chairs are way more comfortable than the standard chair in the airport. I have significant back issues and comfort is a big thing.
- Again, Airline reward lounges are calmer, less busy andare substantially more comfortable then the other type of lounge you can add on to your ticket when booking. Many airports in Europe have a lounge you can buy with your ticket and another lounge for frequent flyers.
- There are 2 types of lounge goers. The newcomers who are all excited, stack the plate and go nuts (we all were at the start) vs the frequent flyer who has a smaller portion and just looking for calm to work or chill and see it as a necessary step to get where they are going.

There are many companies with specific job roles that is more efficient in sending someone they have trained internally and then send them overseas for a few days to weeks to either provide support or be the spoke person on behalf of the local teams stationed or hired at.

And since you are travelling for business, some companies makes sure they show that their companies are also doing well which is indicating a good reputation, by making sure their employees stay in a good hotel and travel good flights (usually business class but some companies are starting to cut corners (or saving budget as they claimed) and fly them economy class, but hey, at least you can travel).

That way, you do not have to pay bills, but also get paid for your meals.

For flights: get a good miles reward card and/or learn how to search the internet for cheap flights. Unless you have specific destinations that you HAVE to go to, plan your destinations around where flights are cheapest. 

For lodging: stay in hostels or camp instead of getting a hotel room. Especially in Europe, there are a lot of great hostels and most have shared kitchens (so you can cook too and further save money). 

For food: try to minimize the amount of restaurants  you go to (unless that’s something you’re into and you can pay for it).

You don’t need a large house to be happy, a big ass Ford F150 raptor and a Rolex around your wrist.

As a non-American it’s really, *really* jarring to be asked non-stop “what kind of work do you do?” So people can scale you, so they can define your status. It’s really shallow.

Live smaller, drive a smaller more economical car and fuck that 12+ hour workday, 6 days a week to pay for shit you don’t need because you’re in an imaginary dick measuring contest with friends, neighbours and colleagues.

Check flight.google.com and set alerts for flight ticket prices you feel comfortable with, travel outside the busy season. Visit countries that aren’t hyped up constantly, look for cheap places to stay and just explore a place. None of that “top 20 things you need to see in X!”

Just wake up, get a coffee somewhere, unwind, slow your pace, ask locals about their favourite places to eat or hang out and walk wherever you want to go. 

Most people are in competition with influencers who don’t give a shit where they are. They are paid to be there, to lure more tourists to make a quick buck. Fuck all that noice.

Go to a country you barely know anything about (Georgia, Montenegro, Madeira, Surinam etc) and just enjoy that feel of exploring shit on your own pace.

I’d rather go to a country for 5 days and just wander around instead of speedrunning 6 cities in 5 days and return home exhausted. It also saves a ton of money.

mo3s8xp,1k3ohd7,reddit,"If you can be patient and have flexible dates you can find deals. I use Google Flights and for destination use ""Europe"" or ""Latin America"". If you have flexible dates then you can search for 2 weeks in April or 1 week in September kind of thing. Flying from Denver I've had $425 airfare to Costa Rica, Columbia and Peru using that strategy. Find a cheap room someone is renting out in their house on Airbnb, eat with the locals and you have a week long vacation for well under $1,000.

One challenge you'll have is that you'll need to drive to a major airport which might be a few hours because I doubt you'll find those deals from Omaha. Look at the off times when everyone else is working. The time between Thanksgiving and Christmas is nice. Late January is another good time. If you want warmer weather in Europe April and September are shoulder seasons and offer cheaper prices than summer or spring break. 

As others have noted, reward credit cards are awesome. They're only great if you pay them off every month, otherwise you're earning 2% cash back but paying 17% interest and that math doesn't math. Wells Fargo and Citi both offer a 2% cash back card with no annual fee. It might take a few years but save up $1,000 worth and free trip. 

I'm not anywhere close to rich and I live a very frugal life. I don't eat out very often and I rarely will drink when I'm out because it ends up being $10 after tax and tip for a beer I can buy for $2 at the store. All those dollars add up and I can take vacation and get experiences instead.

Wife and I had no kids. I went to college and got a mechanical engineering degree. We didn’t go on any trips except for maybe 1 every 2 years. She went to college and got a nursing degree. Now we go on 1 or 2 big trips a year, mostly limited by my works vacation time. 

I have had some years where I really try to take the most advantage of my time off. If there’s a 3 day weekend then that’s an opportunity to drive/fly somewhere Saturday, explore it Sunday, drive/fly back Monday. 

Mostly though when it seems like someone travels somewhere all the time, and it seems like “they’ve been there” when someone else is talking about a place, it’s just from consistent travel over time. 

My wife started working in 2018ish so we started really traveling then.  That was 7 years ago, we didn’t go anywhere in 2020 or 2021, but she did do some travel nursing in Wisconsin so we ended up doing a drive across that state in the winter to go to Green Bay and Madison.  Not as “exotic” as a trip to Portugal or Korea or wherever, but still enjoyed it just as much. 

Cost wise… it’s not really much more expensive to go to Europe or Asia as it is compared to the US.  In the US you’re spending $200+ per night for a safe, clean, bug free hotel. Meals are $20 per person with the tip. 

Going to Europe you’ll spend less per night on the hotel and less per meal, more like $12 per meal since there’s no tip requirement.  Asia is even better, Korea you can get a good enough hotel for less than $150 per night, meals are about $10 per person cause of the exchange rate. In Europe and Asia, subway and bus systems will take you wherever you want to go for pennies, so no need to take expensive Ubers everywhere.

-There are sites like TrustedHousesitters where you can housesit for free in exchange for watching someone's animals. I use this to extend a trip. Spend a week housesitting and living like a local, then switch to a hostel or cheap hotel to do all the day-long touristy things. 


-There's also work for accomodation sites like WWOOF and HelpX. They're mainly known for helping on farms, homesteads and the like, but there's often hostels, homes, and community projects that need a few hours help per day than the rest of the time is yours.

Also, you can travel economically. Once you have the gear, tent camping and backpacking is really cheap, especially in the US. For cities, you can stay in hostels.

I almost always prefer planning my own day trips (usually with public transportation) versus doing tours, because I can do exactly what I want on my own schedule. I generally have not had stellar experiences with guides versus solo trips, but the ones I've liked most have been small family-run operations that take just a few tourists, which are also generally pretty affordable.

With transportation options, ten times out of ten I would rather take a train, bus, or ferry than fly, because I really dislike airports and all the bullshit. I love sleeper trains in particular.

An example: took an overnight train with a sleeper cabin, paid extra for the private train, it was in worse shape than the Vietnam Railway ones attached to the same engines.  Planes need to look at total cost, luggage costs, if it’s a direct flight, length of trip.  The buses in Portugal were fine, factor in how far the trip is.  In Zambia, was in a bus with 5 seats across, an interesting ride, but not bad.  

For Lodging read the reviews, not the overall rating, as it can be skewed.  Look at what amenities the room has plus figure out what size is comfortable, plus how long you will be there, overnight requires less fancy.  

Maybe I’m less fussy.  Had to laugh when my daughter and wife did the arrangements to New Zealand and Australia we stayed in Hostels.  When I did the arrangements on other trips, always booked rooms with en suite bathrooms.

mn9ai2i,1jz6ts7,reddit,"I just flew w Etihad (3 weeks ago) and took up their offer of free 2 nights accommodation. It was really easy with the hotel options (there were four) and booking all done before confirmation and payment on the Etihad website. Hotel email confirmation arrived pretty much the same time as flight confirmation. No issues once arrived at hotel as well though fyi breakfast is not included and though you can check in anytime, you can't stay longer than 48 hours.

I also got my visit / transit visa via Etihad website in an hour (even though they said 4 working days). 

Abu Dhabi really surprised me with the amount of things to do (mosque, palace, markets, louvre, desert) that I could have filled 4 days easily. The buses are also very nice and reliable and I walked everywhere without issues. 

I would definitely recommend the Abu Dhabi layover but my experience was much different. Did you book through an agent or another website?",2025-04-15 16:31:40,1,_fountainhead,travel

mkoyu3z,1jo4s1y,reddit,"In South America, i've discovered that they do have AC (not everyone but if you have even a little bit of money you do), but its considered something you only have in your bedroom. Unless you have a lot of money, you never have in the rest of the apartment/house.

We are talking places that get to be 40c (110f)  with 95% humidity in the summer. AC is just seen as a sleep thing.

However, apartments and houses are designed for this weather, and because the houses aren't insulated for the cold, they are designed instead to shed heat much better. Much of the reason we need AC in North America is because the houses are really designed to keep heat in. In South America, the houses are built with huge windows that open up and you're basically living outside. In Brasil, I saw many homes where half of the living space is like a giant patio outside in the middle of the home. You have the front of the house, then a huge courtyard surrounded by a concrete wall with your dining room table, kitchen, washer/dryers, etc outside, and then another building in the back just for bedrooms. Basically half the house is missing a roof.

However busses, cars, hotels, offices, public transit, gyms and malls all have AC. Basically any commercial space, to attract customers.

mkwmu7d,1jo4s1y,reddit,"This topic always makes me feel like an alien. This is a bit of a rant so feel free to skip lol

I know I'm a bit of an unusual case, but I'm extremely sensitive to heat and humidity and not at all sensitive to cold. I grew up in the Bay Area, California in houses with no AC. Temps average 85-90 F in the summer with multiple 100+ heat waves. Average temps in winter are 40-55 F. The only saving grace is that it cools off reasonably once the sun goes down most of the time.

No. I did not get used to it. My 9 month summers were full of sleepless sweaty nights and miserable sweaty days, and I developed seasonal depression that still hits me every time the temperature starts to creep up. It's like a constant wear on your nerves that you only realize the extent of when you step outside to the first cool breeze of fall and you feel like you can breathe again for the first time in months.

I know the reason is partly because AC is a newer invention and most people throughout history didn't have it, but people throughout history also weren't dealing aith the kind of heat we now are because of climate change. It kinda makes my blood boil how people dismiss AC as this frivolous nonsense while heat is a necessity. Heating is more expensive (at least in the US, ymmv), but AC is seen as the luxury.

Sure, heating is necessary to a point, but cooling should also be necessary to a point. If I walk into a 80-85F (26-29 C) building--10-15 (5-9) degrees above room temp--and complain it's too hot, I get told I'm spoiled from having AC and to just deal with it, but if others walk into a 55-60F (12-16 C) building--10-15 (5-9) degrees below room temp--and complain it's freezing, the owner of the building would be treated like a villain for not heating the place enough. Nevermind the fact that there's many options for personal heating and very few for personal cooling.

Also I'm tired of the widely publicized deaths and injuries from extreme cold and then the extreme heat hits and we ignore all the deaths and injuries from heat and the news headlines are like ""It's gonna be beautiful and sunny, get ready for beach day! 😜🤙

I hate cold AC and when it's real hot outside, I'm dressed to be outside and now I'm freezing and my throat hurts from the AC and dryness...

I think a lot of people in the USA are used to overspend energy waaaay over their needs and we know that in Europe, as well as almost anywhere else in the world, energy is much more expensive and people are habituated to saving it and tolerating a certain margin of ""discomfort"" to the point that they are used to it and don't find it as uncomfortable. I know for myself I've gone a few very hot summers (30C average before humidex in a very busy part of town, living on the last floor) without any AC and...sometimes I was hot, but most of tje time I was fine, I was feeling pretty comfortable. Being busy and moving (like doing chores or even just going about your day) spends energy and cools you down.

During the night just open up the windows to get the wind flow, even if it's warm it's very comfortable to feel to wind. And if there's a fan, especially ceiling fans, setting it to medium feels good (high feels warmer.) and have a cold glass of water by the bed to keep yourself hydrated and refreshed.

From what I've heard from people who visited China and Japan a few times, those two countries can be extremely humid (I guess depending on regions but Japan was told like it was all over) so the AC is set to high for , I guess part comfort, but also to to prevent damage to the inside of rooms and buildings in general (like furniture, walls/construction materials, etc) by drying up the air so it won't mold.

But otherwise, I recommend everyone to get in the habit of lowering their AC to a degree that's slightly lower than outside, but not a whole other climate 😂 it's better for your health and the environment.",2025-03-31 15:02:16,5,Pumpkinp0calypse,travel

mm3cgut,1juhh0f,reddit,"Any cruise.

I have never had fun on a cruise. 

It’s like being trapped in a closed shopping mall with thousands of classless bored people who lose all concept of etiquette and go into survival mode.

I was on a giant Carnival cruise ship a few years ago and wanted to jump off the boat. 

- Everything was closed. I never saw the onboard casino open, the onboard shops opened only the last day for a few hours. I witnessed one buffet open once, but it closed before we got to the front of the line. 

- Even the mini golf on the top deck was closed for most of the trip, when they briefly opened it, it was mobbed by hundreds of people desperate for any little scrap of fun.

- They occasionally opened a pizza stand by the pool, but the line immediately wrapped all the way around the deck whenever it briefly flashed open because everyone was desperate for hot food.

- There were a few times that a cruise worker announced that they were playing some game, and the boat was so devoid of fun that hundreds of people crowded into the atrium in desperation around them, when they were just trying to play some little trivia game with a few guests, (not entertain the whole boat because there was no other entertainment.) They looked so overwhelmed by the mob that they stopped doing those little public games.

- I got my period during the trip unexpectedly, and there was not one tampon or pad to be found on the boat, not one restroom with a dispenser, not one open store, I had to fold up paper towels in my underpants until we stopped in Central America and I found a drugstore. (Periods only happens to me every 5-10 years so I’m never prepared and used to scrambling in an emergency, but what if a kid had their first period on the boat?)

So he required I pay him for his trouble and then gave me a specific time when I could pick up my bags. It was so weird as the hotel's website lists bag storage as an amenity, and didn't list any hours. And it was like 11am.

mk7ycqi,1jl8x9m,reddit,"I’m glad you had a good time, but travel to Antarctica purely for tourist reasons is really unjustifiable. Tourism in the form of cruises and expeditions has a significant negative impact on the Antarctic ecology. 

Not counting the huge spike in carbon emissions per tourist just to get there, black carbon emitting vessels like cruises massively speed the melting of snow and ice. Tourists from all over the world greatly increase the chance of introducing invasive fungus and plant species as well as diseases, and expeditions disturb the local wildlife and can disrupt their reproductive cycles. 

Nearly every Antarctic scientist who’s spoken about this has taken a stand against tourism in the region, and while there’s a lot of discussion on how best to restrict tourism and mitigate its negative impact, the consensus is that it needs to be done. Many scientists themselves feel that even their own presence there is too much and have to carefully weigh whether or not their research is worth the environmental impact of them being there. 

I love travel as much as all of you, and being able to see Antarctica would be incredible, but I would never ever go. I cannot in good conscience contribute to the active destruction and degradation of one of the last nature reserves left on this planet, and I hope you also consider the impact of your choices before you plan a trip.",2025-03-28 17:43:57,25,perksofbeingcrafty,travel

ml0owpp,1jpntq2,reddit,"You should definitely check out Armenian wine country. I went last November, and it was absolutely incredible, better than any wine I’ve had in the US. Armenia is one of the oldest wine-producing regions in the world, with a history of winemaking dating back over 6,000 years. The country’s terroir, with its volcanic soil and high-altitude vineyards, creates wines that are rich, complex, and unlike anything you’ll find elsewhere.

The main wine regions, like Vayots Dzor and Aragatsotn, are stunning, with dramatic mountain landscapes and vineyards stretching across rolling hills. The Areni grape, one of the world's oldest, produces some fantastic reds, bold, fruit-forward, but with great structure and minerality. The whites, especially those made from the Voskehat grape, are crisp, floral, and refreshing.

Beyond the wine itself, the hospitality is next level. Wineries are usually small, family-run, and incredibly welcoming, often inviting you to sit down with the owners and winemakers to hear their stories over homemade cheese, lavash, and fresh local produce. Places like Zorah, Old Bridge, and Voskevaz make world-class wines, and the setting, ancient monasteries, caves where they’ve found evidence of prehistoric winemaking, and vineyards nestled in breathtaking scenery, adds to the experience.

It’s not a place that immediately comes to mind for most travelers, but if you’re into wine, history, and off-the-beaten-path destinations, Armenian wine country is unbeatable.",2025-04-02 13:19:41,50,PaintingMinute7248,travel

San Francisco's Golden Gate Park is also an Olmsted Park and bigger than Central Park, but it lets cars pass through it, and it's bordered by low-rise middle-class residences on the edge of the city so it's not as beloved and well-used by a wide demographic as NYC's Central Park.

Mostly for health reasons. The reason you're told to travel while you're young is because when you're young your body can handle more, you have more energy and you never know what's going to happen in the future.

The idea is that when you are young, you are on a limited budget. You are forced to experience the lives of common people (eg. Take cheapest transport) and to interact with other people (eg, hostels hitch hiking). You will eat locally (eg. Supermarkets, cheap takeaway) and you will plan better (eg. Prefer inconvenient but in-expensive hostels, look for cheapest alternatives).

All these will give you a slice of reality. 

When you are older, you may be able to afford to hire a guide and go heli-skiing in the morning and spend the evening in a casino before sleeping in a fivestar hotel. This is good but very plastic.

2. Travelling young is just a different experience.

What is more, I used to backpack and sleep at train stations / parks etc, which is something I simply will never do now with a family.

Goa when it was a deserted beach. And saw the world before over tourism. Being the only tourists at Angkor wat or borobdur or Machu Picchu. Staying in Phnom Penh when the few westerners hung out at the foreign correspondents club, Vietnam before there were any hotels, only government guesthouses, Myanmar, Bali pre-tourists, Singapore when orchard rd and bugis st had actual hawker stalls, not the sterilized food courts they have today, and of course Bangkok before sukhamvit and patpong were night markets. Kathmandu when freak street was the place everyone smoked hash. Or Zambia when there were just a few locals running raft trips by Victoria falls on the Zambezi.

mk021tp,1jkzna1,reddit,"I guess I encourage more young people to travel because they often do not know what they are missing. I, probably incorrectly, assume if you are my age (55) and don’t travel you’ve made a conscious effort to not get a passport. To not explore. You certainly know the outside world exists but for whatever reason you’ve deprioritized wandering through it. 

For many your youth is free. You have the least responsibilities, not tied down, you are a sponge for knowledge and many of your biases, and perspectives are not yet formed. Travel and exposure to different people and cultures expands your mind at a time before you begin to close it. And you’ll gladly expect less comfort. We love to travel but I’m not staying at a hostel. lol. That probably cuts down on some great experiences but I do need a certain level of comfort. 

Then there is a tough period of trying to get a career off the ground, raise kids, learn how to live with and grow a partnership, etc. That all conspires to put travel further down the list. Your 30’s and 40’s tend to be family travel. Trying to appease a toddler, an 8 year old and a 16 year old missing her boyfriend is a challenge. So more Disney and less Amazon rainforest. 

Then you emerge from that as an empty nester like we are with hopefully more money and if you’re lucky and not scared of strangers and strange lands you’ll have a sense of adventure. You’ll have built a list of places you’ve wanted to see. And if you’re smart you’ll start seeing them. 

I suppose the next phase is when the body catches up with you. Traveling becomes a challenge due to physical limitations. I dread that period. I really hope I can put that off long enough to at least satisfy my largest chunk of planned adventures.",2025-03-27 12:35:48,2,ChiGuyDreamer,travel

mk04pbq,1jkzna1,reddit,"You can do both. But people say that for a few reasons. 

1- Traveling while you're young might give you some wisdom or a life-altering experience early on. It would be amazing to have something awakened in you at 20 that changes your life, rather than at 40 after spending 20 years doing something you hate, or etc.

2- If you wait til you're older, you're more likely to have a steady job, marriage, mortgage, kids, and other responsibilities that may make it much harder to travel.

3- If you wait *too* long to do certain types of travel, you just may not be able to do them to the same degree. Chances are if you want to climb Kilimanjaro, you have a way better shot at 25 than 65.

The thing about traveling young is if you love it, it will inspire you to travel when you're older too. If you wait til you're older to travel you might very well think, ""why the FUCK didn't I do this when I was younger?""",2025-03-27 12:52:16,2,onemanmelee,travel

mk0jbxo,1jkzna1,reddit,"Traveling when you are younger opens up your perspective on how things work outside of your normal bubble. It gives you experiences you can use to talk with other people and be more compassionate, interesting, and grounded. 

Traveling when you are older allows you to enjoy subtler aspects of the places you visit and to look beyond the touristy aspects. You should feel more freedom to take your time vs pounding down a whirlwind itinerary and your body will likely aid in that more relaxed pace. 

When I was younger I only ever traveled for work. That didn't give me much opportunity to experience the culture of different places I visited. In my late forties I started traveling for my own enjoyment and I realized how much I had missed out on and how short of a window I have to make up for it now.

mllvu4t,1js9toe,reddit,"I'm on my first visit. I've lived in a riad a week, and seeing this post I just realized that this city already has a place in my heart.

Coming from developed countries that are so sterile and ordered, the medina has struck me by how organic and ""human"" it all is. The streets and alleys that pump people through the city like arteries splitting and turning and branching into tiny capillaries. The souks where, when I want some dry beans, I find a man who trades them, and we chat while his friend is off finding change somewhere for my bill.

I know it's essentially the same interaction as at a grocery store, but it feels more personal--he's invested, trading on his own behalf, and the conversation we have is completely ""unscripted"". The cashier at Safeway wouldn't be able to ask curious questions about why I don't look like they'd expect an American to (I'm Native, which I've been having a lot of trouble explaining).

As a dumb monolingual I was lucky his languages included English. I had a funny but friendly interaction with a guy who sold me roasted walnuts (at a really good price). We had trouble communicating, so I ended up just giving him a bill that seemed reasonable and I thought was in line with his pantomiming. He gave me some change, but then it seemed to me like something was wrong. So I waited while he called somebody over from across the street who could translate. It turned out we were both all good (achievement unlocked: miscommunicate through sheer general anxiety level), and we both had a laugh about that. I told him his walnuts are très bien--I know where I'll go next time, if I can ever find that corner again.

I have no illusion that this place is perfect--I know that people are poor, women are treated far from equally, and the economy is awkwardly dependent on bilking tourists from wealthier lands. But as a person who feels like I have trouble connecting with others as much as I'd like, for me there's a magic to this city where if I didn't come out of my shell a bit, I wouldn't be able to eat.",2025-04-05 22:08:23,16,keziahw,travel

mlq5gsn,1jsyxbp,reddit,"Hi, so I'd like to share a quick photo report from one of the least visited countries in the world - Comoros. Small archipelago located in the strait between African mainland and Madagascar. I travelled solo in August/September 2024 and spent 11 days in the country.

The country consists of 3 inhabited islands - Grand Comore (Ngazidja), Mohéli and Anjouan. There's also Mayotte, fourth island in the archipelago, which is actually a department of France, as they voted against independence in the 1970s. Unfortunately I did not visit Mayotte during my trip, the flight tickets between Comoros and Mayotte are quite costly, the ferries are infrequent and equally costly, but mainly I did not have that much time and Mayotte did not seem interesting enough to cut my trip several days short.

Comoros' international airport is connected to the world by two major airlines - Ethiopian Airlines and Kenya Airways. I was quite surprised how full the flight was (daily A350 from Addis Ababa), but it makes sense - the islands are not big, but the population is quite large (900k) and as the islands are very mountaineous, any flat land is quite densely populated.

**Grand Comore** is the main island with the capital Moroni and the international airport. I would say it's the least interesting one, if it weren't for the Karthala volcano, which is stunning! It's 2361 m above the sea level and you can climb it and spend a night in the caldera. That was probably the best experience during the whole trip.

**Mohéli** is the smallest island popular for nature and wildlife - lemurs, Livingstone bats, humpback whales, turtles. While the problem with travelling in Comoros is the lack of infrastructure, Moheli has got a Belgian-owned lodge, which is not only a nice place to stay (seeing a \*clean\* beach after visiting the other two islands felt so relaxing, even though I am not a beach guy) but has locally contracted guides and you can easily make day trips from there. Diving and snorkelling is also possible.

**Anjouan** is the least visited one. I liked it a lot - but there's not ""much to see"". It's just really mountaineous, traffic is very slow, but you have nice views just about everywhere. The centuries old medina in Mutsamudu was also very nice.

As I mentioned, getting around the islands is a bit complicated. There are flights from Grand Comore to the other two islands, but not between Anjouan and Moheli. I opted for a local speedboat and honestly it's not really the experience I can recommend unless you are very adventurous. It's more than 2 hours on a cramped boat in the open sea. Wouldn't do again! In Grand Comore and Anjouan, I was able to get a car with a driver, in Moheli I just used the excursions from the lodge. Bear in mind that as it is everywhere in Africa, everything for tourists is quite expensive and so is the case in Comoros.

**The pros?** Very few tourists and the ones you meet are usually very-well travelled people. Had lots of nice talks with them. Lots of places feel really untouched and out of this world. Apart from hiking Karthala, the other highlight was a simple cross-island walk in Moheli (had to cross about 550 m tall mountain range). Very nice views, yet the guide had to clear the path with a machette for a large part of the trip. Also, lemurs coming to visit the lodge!

**The cons?** Apart from prices, the trash. I have visited many Asian and several African countries and am not surprised by the trash. But Comoros was a different league. Apart from plastic and paper almost everywhere... there are also carwrecks everywhere. At the beaches, in the gardens and backyards, in the random bushes, everywhere.

**Bottomline?** Interesting destination that gets very few visitors - and it's mostly because the lack of tourists infrastructure, not because the islands are not interesting. They are. I cannot imagine coming back, but I am still very glad I chose to travel there.

Any questions? Just ask.",2025-04-06 17:05:54,67,zennie4,travel

Fun fact in the 1980s many southern African coups and rebellions were run out of Comoros by mercenaries led by Bob Denard. He led four coups in Comoros as well. His little beach house is in a gorgeous location, not far from where an Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed in the 80s. Another interesting thing about Comoros is that it recognized the South African government when others did not, in spite of Apartheid. For this reason there were non-stop flights between the two countries and South Africans would come to resorts on Grand Comore. There are still ruins of the resorts on the beaches.",2025-04-06 22:16:06,8,MrtonyEA,travel

Many locals also really didn't like their photo being taken, even a wide street scene.  I remember lobster was pretty cheap though, had a huge lobster pizza for like $6.

mltt29g,1jsyxbp,reddit,"When I made a list of every country in the world, Comoros and São Tomé were at the bottom of the list and thought I would never get to visit, as there were small and geographically inconvenient.

I ended up travelling to Comoros for a few weeks after a tour of Madagascar, killing time until I had to meet a friend in South Africa.  I wish I’d spent the night in the crater, I hiked Karthala in one day and it killed me (did you drive up the road or did you have to hike that too? We had to start way at the bottom and just the road was 4 hours of hiking).

Moheli is some of the best diving in the world. I did my formative diving at Laka including my AOWD - humpbacks, tuna, wahoo, garden eels, sharks, turtles. It spoiled me for diving. I would go back in a heartbeat as a dive destination.

I also really enjoyed Anjouan but it’s all about the vibe. People are great everywhere and got invited to a World Cup qualifier match in Moroni and made quite a few local friends.

The trash is probably the worst in the world, and from your pictures, it looks better than it was. Considering how big of a tourist destination it used to be back in the day, it is a shame to see the state of it now.",2025-04-07 07:15:54,3,mcwobby,travel

That's unfortunately how things are, it would be great if we lived in a world full of religious tolerance but that's not the world we live in. As for Prague, it is actually a city where people usually mind their business, so as other Redditor suggests, it could have been someone drunk, a person with problematic behavior, with mental issues etc. It's not common to attack people.

To put it into perspective, I am not wearing my kippah in Brussels or Berlin, so if you decide to wear religious clothing, then you unfortunately are theoretically putting yourself into a possible danger and make a target of yourself. Same would be if you were visibly gay, that is actually much more dangerous. I was spat on for only wearing a pink T-shirt in a Muslim neighborhood.

spend a night in Miyajima, the quiet period in between the last boat and the first the following day can be really special.

Restaurant Muni in Kyoto, excellent chef making French/Japanese fusion in an open style kitchen, watching is half the fun.

My partner and I are potentially planning to visit in November too but this year. We will be driving up from SD and flying out of LA since it’ll likely be cheaper flights. 

Anyway, can you share which hotels you stayed at? How often did it rain? How often was it sunny? I’ve read that it doesn’t rain as much in fall/winter and the historical averages reflect that but obviously things can change. 

I was thinking of doing this:

4 days in Tokyo. 

4 days in Kyoto with 1 day at a Ryokan a bit outside of the city with mountain or lake views. 

2 days in Osaka. 

Is Osaka worth the visit? I think the introvert in me would prefer more chill towns but I enjoy street photography and Osaka seems ideal for that especially if it rains at night. I’ve been to a lot of major world cities as well, Paris, NY, Cairo, Delhi for example.

mn6w19c,1jzeo44,reddit,"I took up this offer 8 years ago and the options were accommodation OR a full day tour. Cheap hotels in Istanbul are a dime a dozen so I chose the tour to sort of dip my toes in. 

Best decision ever! You go a sort of very hidden counter at IST and show your ticket (be careful of code sharing, as far as I remember they only accepted Turkish Air codes) The bus was wonderful, the tour was wonderful, we got to eat at a very high end restaurant and my fellow passengers were great. 

Their advertising tactic worked as I went back 4 more times. One of the times I was able to use the accommodation option so back then I don't think there was a limit on how many times you could use it?

Sadly the organization seems to have declined in quality. I tried to use the tour option couple of years ago and it was a shit show.

mmg3uui,1jw63sn,reddit,"They want to sell you a timeshare. Honestly, my husband and I almost always carve out the 90mins or so to sit through the high pressure sales because we’ve gotten some really great free stuff out of it. It’s extra fun for us because he’s a litigator and I negotiate contracts/ create negotiation strategies for a living, so it’s like insane practice with people we will never see again. We never buy anything and the line that always gets us out of there is “sorry guys, in my line of work if the deal doesn’t exist when we leave the table it’s never a good deal”

We’ve gotten free spa days, Marriott always gives us $400 (my parents own a MVC so I think we get extra), multiple free vacations, etc. 

It’s a pain in the ass and very high pressure. But, if you can hack it and don’t mind wasting vacation time, the sales pitches are always something we giggle about in our debrief. The funniest one was Iberostar wanting us to give them $118k immediately and acting like it was such a good deal 😂 But you also have to go in knowing you’re not spending a dime and you’re in it for the free stuff.

ETA: the “final offer” we got from iberostar (funny enough we rushed out of that presentation quickly because norovirus hit me in the middle of it) was $27k. Timeshares are such a scam, it’s so funny.",2025-04-10 20:07:47,443,ChiknTendrz,travel

It also has a ski resort maybe a 30 minute drive from the city and a semi famous observatory (Pluto was discovered there!)


Flagstaff has a great nightlife for a city its size, is very walkable if you're in the downtown area, and is just the most ideal place to stay for anyone visiting Grand Canyon or Sedona, with better food and bar options than either of those locations and being right between the two.

Edit: I've had a few pretty negative comments in response that aren't here any longer.... 

I was only being honest; I was not trying to be negative. The world changes. The internet changed the world; if you were here after you, just dont know the difference. The internet changed people and how they travel. The untraveled, long-lost road doesn't really exist any longer, and I was only pointing this out.

Suwarrow Island, Cook Islands. A stunning national park with one caretaker and literally nothing but birds, fish, and palm trees. All the coconuts you could want. Perfect snorkling and scuba diving. (Need your own gear) Incredible spot for a hammock nap. (Bring your own hammock)


Niuatoputapu, Tonga. A very small island that's quite a bit further north from the rest of the islands that make up the kingdom of Tonga. We visited about a year after they had gone through crazy destruction from a tsunami and helped rebuild a few homes and fences and whatnot. Great hiking and snorkeling/scuba diving (probably need your own gear)


Ureparapara, Vanuatu. A small village rests on the shores of a lagoon created from a collasped volcanic crater. A sort of C shaped island with steep volcanic slopes and lush vegetation. The women there are some of the only folks in the world that do a water dance. Slapping and manipulating the water to create impressive sounds and music. Really freaking cool. 


Kiritimati Island (Christmas Island, Tabuaeran Island, and Washington Island, Kiribati (a ""ti"" is pronounced as an ""s"", so Kiribati is pronounced Kir-ee-bas). Did cargo to these island that sit pretty much right on the equator. The nation of Kiribati is made up of hundreds of tiny atolls, but spread over an area roughly the size of the continental USA. Incredible people, facing their island homes slipping away into the ocean as weather gets more intense and ocean levels rise. 


The people throughout the South Pacific are hands down the most incredible folks on the planet. Living in some of the most beautiful places, while facing some incredibly unique and difficult challenges.

Going to the gym, looking good and feeling good, has been priority for me from my home activities. I sought out hotels that had gyms, and I found the Urban Sports Club app to gain access to local gyms so I'd have coverage when in hotels, hostels, or guesthouses that don't have gyms. It's been very helpful for me, because I had a good routine of going to the gym in the morning, then showering and going out for the day, or going to the gym in the evening and then doing my laundry at a self-service laundromat. 


On shorter vacation trips around the US I usually don't bother with the gym, but on business trips I try to go at least twice a week. 


I do think your point of using it as way to immerse yourself is the correct way to look at it. I learned about the differences in gym culture here in Portugal vs the US and UK, and it's also helped me understand and appreciate Portugal's much healthier society vs the US. On top of that, it helps you learn navigation and some of the language as you engage with the apps, the gym staff, the machines, the trainers, etc. I've found that to be very helpful for my overall quality of life on the trip. ",2025-04-22 10:59:54,1,by_a_pyre_light,travel

Overall, the city (outside the immediate Vatican area) seemed comparatively quiet, even major touristy spots like the colosseum and museums. The many specifically religious visitors apparently weren't keen on doing tourist things at the time.

Do dress a bit conservatively for the churches in particular, but that also applies to any other time. 

Edit: by quiet I mean, major city normal, but we did feel it was possibly a little less busy than expected in the areas we visited.

There was not a chance to just ""walk into st Peter's square"", it was a line all the way back to Sant'Angelo and several hours wait.

- you didn't indicate how long your trip is, but if you have the patience for the massive crowds (and for the disappointment of black smoke declaring a round of voting that did not elect a pope), you could stand in St. Peter's Square when they announce the new Pope.

Ultimately the city continued on, with things related to the crown being closed. Be prepared to change plans, some things cancelled literally the morning of. Even the hop on bus closed one day because the routes were so affected by various closures. It was a very very unique experience, and we kept our distance from most of the proceedings.

Anyways, to answer op’s question. I collect different things. Usually small items as they are easier to pack. Magnets are my go to as well as the Starbucks been there cups. I always go for the smaller espresso sized cups but they are really hard to find. I also try to buy local art whenever I can. Locally made art is perfect and depending on the context can be quite meaningful. Local art comes in many forms too. I once found a girl in Porto hand painting magnets.

mmtmxv0,1jxvfcf,reddit,"I’ll go against the grain here and say yes, I have regretted spending too much on a vacation. Went skiing in the US which costed three times the amount I spent skiing in France, I didn’t think the price difference was worth it. I often weigh up the “value” I get out of trips. Another one was a family holiday on the coast renting a house near the beach. I’m in Australia and that trip costed more than our trip to Bali which was more fun. The way I approach things is how much enjoyment I get vs cost. If I’m spending big on accommodation it’s either for safety reasons or there’s some sort of historical/cultural interest. When we went to Bali we stayed at a luxury resort because the price was relatively cheap and for me it was worth the price difference compared to the other options. I’m not going to stay in a luxury hotel back in Sydney because the price wouldn’t be worth the extra cost for me. 

I’ve had holidays which were expensive, such as ningaloo reef but the value I got out of it was the uniqueness of the experience, swimming with whale sharks, hiking stunning gorges and staying on a cattle station. So yeah, there is definitely a cost analysis going into things and in your case I would be adding up how much extra enjoyment I would expect from the luxury hotel and if that was worth the expense. ",2025-04-13 00:49:26,116,Lingonberry_Born,travel

mmtqlvj,1jxvfcf,reddit,"I have absolutely regretted spending too much on a vacation. We went to an all inclusive in Cabo. The restaurants within the resort were overbooked, the service extremely slow, and I had allergies that they assured me could be accommodated. They were great the first night and then the head chef went home for the weekend or whatever and I basically got pasta sauce on bread. I mean I didn’t starve, but it also was not worth the price we paid. The resort was also in an area where you can’t go in the ocean due to rip tides or some such. It was single-handedly the worst vacation I have ever been on.

I have heard similar reviews from others who have been to Cabo. They said to stay in a hotel closer to downtown and just enjoy the restaurants there. The all-inclusives there just aren’t worth it as much.

For my part, we live in Southern California. I would have been happier renting a place in Carlsbad for a few nights and eating at some local restaurants. And once flights were figured in, it would have been a similar price.

Think about what makes you happy. For me, I couldn’t care about extra space and it would feel like a waste of money. Literally I couldn’t enjoy it knowing how much it costs and I will feel bad in the space because it feels pointless. It reduces my enjoyment of the experience. I feel this way about any bottle of wine over like $20-30. I rarely regret going out to eat though, and enjoy the break from cooking.

mngybhl,1k0n1vg,reddit,"I'll be the odd one and risk the downvotes, but no, I hate airports and airplanes.  They are an evil necessity.  An airport's main job is to screw you over as much as possible.  Some budget airlines still don't have online check in, so you're required to be there super early and wait in a massive line.  TSA is often understaffed.  Sometimes their staff is friendly, other times absolute dicks who hate their job.  Every airport has different policies, or maybe it's simply TSA making shit up as they go.  One time it's shoes off, the next it isn't.  One time my toothpaste is fine, the next it isn't because it's a 3.5oz container, which is 0.5 too much despite being half empty.  Plus you always have that idiot in front of you.  She's wearing shoes she can't easily remove, a big belt for no reason, a zip up hoodie that she acts confused about when asked to remove it, 12 bracelets she's having problems removing and then steps into the x-ray booth her with her cell phone in her back pocket.  

Congrats, now you're passed the fake security.  Now you have like 90 minutes to kill because you always have to be early vs risk missing your flight.  Your gate has about 1/3rd the seating needed, so you have to sit at another gate or take that 1 seat next to the dude coughing a lung up, because he's attitude is who cares if I'm sick, I have a flight to catch.  Or you could go eat food, at double the normal price with shitty customer service.  Forget anything?  Oh, yeah, you're getting fucked when you try to buy a simple charging cable for your phone.  $2.99 on Amazon, $30 at the airport.  Advil?  $6.99 for a 2 pack of pills.  

Time to board!  Yup, just more BS. Front people board first, so they get the joy of 75 more asses being shoved in their face while they wait for take off. While you wait to board, there's always that person who can't find their boarding pass, already closed the app and has to pull it back up, etc. Traveling with only a person bag, just stay seated and wait till the line is 99% gone, and they do last call.  Then you get to your seat and someone's sitting there.  ""Oh, you can just sit over there.""  Nope, fuck that, I'm not taking a middle seat, I was assigned the aisle thank you.  I don't care if you want to sit next to your husband, child or grandma, I'm not taking the middle seat.  I'm not even tall or fat and airline seats still suck on a good day.  On a bad day, a fat person is 10% into my seat space.  GREAT!  Then you get all the BS rules like tray tables up until they say, or no cell phone usage despite I know the flight attendants are still texting their boyfriend from last night.

La Befana at Piazza Navona on January 6/7

Now this was almost 20 years ago, and now I believe there is an official organized event, so do look up recent info if you are trying to see this.

But in parts of Italy, the spirit of Christmas (beyond the Jesus in a manger scenes that were everywhere, I even saw ones made out of chocolate, pasta, or butter), is not Santa Claus, but the witch La Befana. 

The story goes that after Jesus was born, and the star appeared, the 3 kings asked for directions of La Befana to the new boy king, and she blew them off thinking it wasn't important.

But when the star disappeared, she was like ""Oh damn, I gotta find that boy king."" But she had no idea where or who he was. So she'd go out and look in windows, and if she saw kids being good she left a gift just in case it was Jesus, and if they were bad left coal. So she covered all the bases just in case.

And she doesn't come on Christmas Day, but on the final ""12th day of Christmas"" the Epithany, January 6thish.

So everywhere we went we saw cackling Halloween witches instead of Santas. I loved it.

Apparently you can see La Befana in a window in Piazza Navona, Rome. During the holiday season its a Christmas market, selling many little witches amongst the Jesus and other items of the season.

Well 20 years ago, on the evening of January 6th everyone rushed to the Piazza Navona. We were trying to go in a different direction, but the crowd carried us into the Piazza. It was scary, but then it opened up, and we saw Santas and Witches and everyone sang Christmas songs while pointing up at the window where she should appear. It was a lot of fun on our last night in Rome.

I believe now they make it a daytime event, which a person dressed as a witch who is in a harness and flies down to the ground and then gives kids candy.",2025-04-10 01:16:40,18,jadeoracle,travel

mlnfg2z,1jskg1d,reddit,"Ignoring that comparing things across continents is a rather big generalization, but no, traveling in South America is no way more expensive than Europe. Not even remotely close.

Going through your post point by point:

Public transportation absolutely exists all over South America, apart from perhaps the most remote places. How do you think locals that earn a fraction of the average European get around? Do you think they all use taxis and overpriced tour buses? Just because the routes aren't always conveniently laid out on Google Maps it doesn't mean they don't exist. Frankly that's a bit lazy on your part for not doing research.

Crime: I can understand your point to some extent, but at the same time you're also really massively generalizing an entire continent and making a lot of big assumptions that are simply invalid. For example, when you say:

>you can probably find more affordable prices the further you stray from the tourists places, but the areas start to get shady quite quickly

You're basically making the assumption that ""touristic = safe, non-touristic = unsafe"", you're making a big leap of logic that is not true at all and frankly has some tricky implications. 

> For example in Rio, I find most of the restaurants along Copacabana and Ipanama at about USD20-25 per pax, which is really not all that different from central London and Paris.

Yeah I'm sorry but come on now, this is just completely nonsense. There are tons of restaurants even in Copacabana where you can eat for R$40-50 or less. Good luck having dinner in Soho, London for £6.

You're also omitting arguably the biggest factor in what makes a travel destination affordable or expensive: hotel prices.

2. You don't need to do private tours. Some areas you can rent a car or join a moderately priced group tour. You can get mugged anywhere.

Taking the subway or bus for 10km in Sao Paulo is less than 1usd. How much would that be in Berlin or Madrid?

Of course taking a taxi here will be more expensive than using public transport in Europe (depending where...

mlnd1is,1jskg1d,reddit,"After reading just the title I thought, meh, what's this gonna be? For sure it is about Argentina, now the second most expensive country on earth (according to some indexes).

But after reading the full text, I get your point and partially agree with my experience. But I also think much is depending on a bias, that we know our home region in Europe well. If I travel to another place in Europe, a bit in the agglomeration or in rural areas, I will struggle as well.

>In much of South America, I still have to depend on taxis, tour buses

This is also my feeling. Some places you just can't reach easily without your own car or without a taxi. With that being said, with a bit of planning there often are options. Busses on longer routes stop anywhere if you ask them or flag them down. In some areas, hitchhiking works well. And in some areas, you can rent a car (which are at the airport which is 40min out of town, yeah, this sucks in SA)

>This means that for unexperienced travelers, you might want to pay for private tours 

Good point and I would argue this is not only for inexperienced travelers. Many generel safety tipps lead to increased costs. Like not walking around in the dark. Good look if it gets dark before 6pm. So you either do it anyway, take a taxi or take the closest maybe more expensive place to eat.

>I also find the general prices of things in South America, in the places tourists will go, tend to be quite on par with Europe. For example in Rio, I find most of the restaurants along Copacabana and Ipanama at about USD20-25 per pax, which is really not all that different from central London and Paris.

Here I might disagree because the comparison seems a bit unfair. You can't take the most touristy place of a city and compare it with a whole city. Compare it with Champs-Élysées, Eiffeltower, Oxford Street and then you easily have a much higher price in Europe.

The government of Ecuador in particular does an excellent job of limiting the impact of tourism. It’s incredible that you can get so close to wildlife and that there’s absolutely no fear/flight instinct. And despite being able to get so close, there’s no danger to the ecosystem. 

Tour groups are limited to 15 people, always accompanied by a naturalist that works for the government who makes sure you follow the rules. In addition, overall ship size is limited—you’re never gonna see a mega cruise ship there. Right now I believe the limit is 100 pax. And your frequency is limited. Overall this jacks the price way up because demand outstrips supply most of the time.

mkzcgjx,1jph69j,reddit,"“Tourist trap” might be an American and Canadian term, I’m not sure if it’s used in Europe or elsewhere.

The classic examples of tourist traps were sites advertised on billboards along highways, aimed at people taking road trips. “100 miles until THE CREATURE”. “90 miles until THE CREATURE” and so on.

This was pre-internet, and by the time you got to the exit, the kids would be begging to go see it. You’d pay $5 each or whatever, and THE CREATURE would turn out to be a taxidermy combination of several animals. You’d go “wow, this was a ripoff and a waste of time” and leave.

Similar tourist traps were things like supposed alien bodies, or the world’s largest thing (ball of twine, ball of aluminum foil, etc.)

Other examples would be misleading signs. If you owned a waterfall on the way to Niagara Falls, you could set up signs saying “THIS WAY TO THE FALLS” and trick tourists into paying to see your waterfall.

If people don’t like nature and are bored by it, they might say the Grand Canyon is a tourist trap, if they don’t like museums then the Louvre is a tourist trap, if they don’t like palaces then Versailles is a tourist trap, etc. This is wrong and a misuse of the term, but some people will apply the term if they feel like the lines are long and they didn’t enjoy it.",2025-04-02 05:43:34,26,TheLegendTwoSeven,travel

Any boat tour that doesn't take you onto Liberty or Ellis Island (just a pass-by) is by default a tourist trap in my opinion, because the free commuter Staten Island Ferry also passes the statue on its route.

1. Sorry but You are a western tourist, you are not some special sage who has obtained enlightenment and redefined travel. You probably stay at hostels with other westerners in random towns and get drunk and play cards with other westerners. Then complain how there is nothing to do in town because you went out of your way to avoid what makes that place special

2. Certain places are popular for a reason 

3. I don’t think you realize how many people would DREAM to be in your place and really appreciate it. Many people in here think everyone can just stop their life and backpack for 6 months and find it weird that some people with families only do the on the beaten path things. On the flip side the average  person wants to just do the usual, run of the mill, on the beaten path things. a vacation for most people  is meant to just chill and relax and see a sight or two, not some deep reflective experience.

However there are tourist traps. To me a tourist trap is something that is usually tacky, relatively expensive for what you get, not popular with locals, oftentimes geared to families or partiers, and usually themed  to reflect a surface level view of where you are. It’s meant to operate on the idea that enough visitors will stop once in their vacation to spend money. 

So if you go in a hike up a forest path to a beautiful temple is not a tourist trap even if it’s full of tourist. Maybe it’s popular but it still has cultural value and enjoyment. 

But…the giant restaurant in town that has a jungle theme, stages shows that reenact history or live music that is a bunch of dad rock covers, serves frozen chicken tenders in USD, has a waitstaff that dresses up like ancient people, and has a gift shop that sell shot glasses and golf hats with the name of the place is a tourist trap.

Due to its social media popularity, the entrance fee to the temple has risen considerably, as well as the crowds.

I saw it driving by and stopped. I was on a road trip, driving from national park to national park. It was on one of those roads, between the grand canyon and Zion or something like that. And there arent a lot of options for alternative routes in that area. It's like, if you want to go east from Zion, you're on this road. 
Mostly I wanted a bathroom and some snacks, but the sign made it look like there might be some sort of natural rock formation (like the arches or bridges) worth looking at.

What is there is a gift shop, a petting zoo, a bunch of random ""art"" like sculptures of Bigfoot, etc. Apparently theres also a dwelling carved into the rock (the ""hole"") but I don't even remember that.

It's hard to capture the feel of it in words. But it is definitely a tourist trap. I can guarantee that damn near 100% of the people that stop there are tourists, and damn near 0% of them knew it existed before they drove by.

Prices listed as 1000 lira at a restaurant was suddenly 1000 liras + 9000 liras service fee (arbitrary numbers, I don't have the exact ones at hand).   
  
Dude said the price for a trip to the mountains is 55 euros. Tried to charge my card 95 euros. On a magnetic strip. That, of course, did not work. 

Drove for 3 hours on the bus to the mountains. Bathroom break was 10 euros as the driver said that he had to take the toll road to get to the only available one. I didn't go but the British couple was quite unhappy. 

Being pricey is a massive understatement. For a country with an average salary of 1000 euros, the prices sure did not reflect that.  Prices in Tokyo were like 30-40% cheaper with their average salary being 3x of Turkey. Prices at the Tokyo AIRPORT were like 3x cheaper.

The only place I've really been scammed out of 37 countries was Greece. 
* Signed up for a boat tour on Santorini with hundreds of good reviews on a reputable website only to find out that it didn't exist. Had to throw a fit online to get a refund. 

* Paid for an apartment near the Athens airport with a 9.2 rating on Booking.com and talked to the owner at first, but then he ghosted me and left me on the side of the road with my luggage alone in an area with zero services and wouldn't refund my money - I had to call Booking four or five times. 

* Another apartment I rented, again with great reviews, was advertised as having Internet and a microwave; in reality, the microwave was broken and the Internet was down most of the time, plus I couldn't sleep on the mattress that was as hard as concrete. 

* Everywhere I went, I was treated with disdain, despite the fact that I was a quiet solo traveler that never caused anyone a problem. It just seemed like everyone was totally sick of tourists and they couldn't wait for me to get out of their restaurant or store or whatever. I think I went six days without talking to anyone because no one would have even the briefest exchange with me. This has never happened in the 36 other countries I've visited.

They'd closed down their shop when I didn't come back within 30 minutes and went to find me to return my phone and new charger.

Another time in a market in another city this beggar kid kept asking me for ""baksheesh"", and I fobbed him off. I was buying a book in English from a market stall and my roll of money came out of my pocket and fell to the ground without me noticing when I got my change. It was about $120.

The little beggar kid ran after me and started tugging my shirt ""You drop! You drop!"" and handed me back my money. I was so happy and tried to give him $10 as a reward, and he got all offended and refused it... Then 5 minutes later he came back up to me and went ""Baksheesh?"" again, and that time he accepted the $10.

That’s a grand statement. You think everyone who encounters these problems are just not street smarts? And many of the people seeing the scams aren’t actually falling for them.

I do think the experience may also vary depending on how you travel. As a solo male traveler, I have three times encountered the scam where someone directs you to a particular establishment where there are extremely inflated prices. One of those times, I was merely there for an 8 hour layover and it *still* happened. Never had it happen traveling with my partner and I imagine it wouldn’t happen for you traveling with your wife; I feel they tend to target more impressionable young men alone.

When I say he’s from there, he was born and raised there and lived there until he was 26 before moving to the US for the last 20 years. He goes back every year to see his mom. So I decided to join him one time. 

We primarily used Uber in Turkey or the equivalent. What would happen is we would get approved for the ride, and then they would send us a personal message asking us where we were going. they should have already known where we were going on the app. And so I would reply and they would say oh no, you need to pay two or three dollars more. And I would cancel the ride because I would not agree to it. Then I started figuring out that they were doing that every single time trying to get you to say yes in the private message. Even though you’re on the Uber app. I just then started to ignore those messages and of course the ride came and we were dropped off where we were supposed to go.

The second scam was when we were shopping for Turkish delight. They would offer you a free sample. And then I would say I would want half a half a kilo and they say OK. Then they go and they put it in a box that is a kilo and they tell me that they have to fill the box. So in essence they’re trying to sell you two times the amount that you want. And nothing ever has a price on it per kilo. So at one store, I asked them and they wanted three times the normal price. I think it was like 200 Turkish liras for a kilo and one place told me it was $600 liras per kilo. Of course, I knew going rate and didn’t go for it.

Most people were very generous. Only issue are the really good looking “carpet salesmen” that wander around the mosques and strike up a conversation with you before asking you to go to their “shop”. When you don’t, they want to take you to tea…or just seem to follow you around. 

I was hit by a different one every single day for a week!

Had one guy standing in line with me while I was trying to get in the Bascilica Cistern. It was a long line and it was my last day, so didn’t want to ditch the line and leave. I was trapped.

After finally convincing him I didn’t want carpet, he suggested tea, then wine, then dinner. I said no thank you to each.

When I got OUT of the cistern, he was still there!!! Wanted to walk to the park with me. Creeped me out a bit, but I honestly think they were all harmless and I never caved. 

Ok…well…except one guy (just remembered) that I did cave and have lunch with. He didn’t speak English so we used translate on our cell phones to chat until our batteries died. Then it was over. He wanted to walk me to my hotel…but I said no.",2025-04-15 20:30:43,1,GorgeousUnknown,travel

I do get that taxis can be a hotspot for scams - i never use taxis. I use either the public transport or if i have luggage i have a shuttle service saved under my contacts. I ask them upfront for the price for my route and also pay it upfront. Never even have to pull out my wallet.

But the biggest thing that is leading to how weirded out i feel at these scam posts: i was in a store buying a drink. Guy doesnt speak english, i dont speak turkish, so far so istanbul. He gives me the drink i give him the money, he gives me the change and says something in turkish before going in the back room, i barely listen and just thank him and start walking away - here he comes literally running after me with some more change in hand. I assume he did not have enough in his cash register and had to get it from somewhere.

Here's an example:

I was once in India and my next destination was China, for which I needed to arrange a visa. The china visa centre was next to a random shopping mall at a suburb of New Delhi that tourists would never go to.

""Wow this shopping mall is so western"", I thought, as I passed all the same shop brands I saw back home in the UK. Topshop, Zara, Dunkin Donuts, etc. 

Then I realised, _everyone there was Indian_. So what the hell is western about it? 

And that's the day I realised there is a strong line of separation between western culture and _consumer culture_.

Consumer culture doesn't care where it is, as long as it can sell to the masses. And I think in a lot of cases when people say something is westernised, what they really mean is that consumerism and globalism has taken hold.

Sure, such things kind of started in the west, but none of it represents the cultural identity of anyone in any western country. You could remove all shopping malls and western culture would remain.

Also lived for a year in the '70s on the Yucatan coast, when Playa del Carmen was a village of 1,500 people, and Cancun was just beginning take off.

It is all of the things you mentioned.  So many tourists, whether western or not (I just got back from Japan and the numbers of Chinese and Korean tourists was mind boggling) just change the experience of a place.  

First time I went to Siem Reap, there was literally one hotel.  We had the entire site to ourselves.

First time in Vietnam (Hanoi), there weren't any hotels, only government ""guest houses.""

First times in Boracay (Philippines),  there were a half dozen hotels, all basically two star, local places along the beach and a night club.

First times in Bangkok. (or most of SE Asia for that matter), there were no night markets.  Patpong wasn't a place for tourists, other than males looking for sex.

First time in Singapore- there were actual hawker stalls, sort of like food trucks, outside along Orchard Rd. and along Bugis St., not the warehouses set up today.

Everything is totally different now.  For \*all\* of the reasons you mentioned.   It's very hard to  have an authentic experience.  So many hotels/resorts everywhere.  So many tourists, everywhere.  

It is all of the things you mentioned.  And more.  Cultures have changed to adapt to tourism.  I was recently in Luang Prabang, and what was a sacred rite, the monks walking early each morning to collect alms, is now a tourist experience- the entire way lined with tourists.

If anyone's read this far, I realize my post will be met with ""ok, boomer,"" and I do. feel like I'm yelling 'get off my lawn.'

mots8im,1k6pqmr,reddit,"Funny you ask this and I see it now. Two weeks ago I flew from FCO [ROME FIUMICINO] to ORD [CHICAGO].

At Chicago there was a couple with a child of about 2 which dad had in a backpack carrier at Immigration and Passport control in front of us. They got through fast and I followed shortly behind also passing through quickly. 

As I arrived to our checked baggage kiosk in the next hall someone from Immigration was chasing them down saying there was a concern that had not been addressed with their child. As they passed back toward Immigration I heard the Official tell them there was concern with the photo and that the person wearing the baby didn't have a matching surname.

The couple reappeared shortly with the woman wearing the baby. They were talking while we waited for the checked baggage kiosk to start spitting out bags and I admit I did perk up my ears when they positioned themselves behind me. 

Evidently they'd had to show photos on one of their phones showing age progression of the child. Also, from what they said apparently she hadn't taken his last name when they married and they'd opted girls would share her surname while boys shared his. 

From this I would say just set up an album with age progressed photos of your child on your phone to show if there should be an issue raised. 

Edit to Add Details: They were all traveling on US passports which are good 5 years for minors. I didn't look if there is any special shorter version for infants but I've not noticed anything about this when I applied for my kids to have passports.",2025-04-24 17:48:04,2,RelativelyRidiculous,travel

\- Terrible heat tolerance. My mood and energy levels dip significantly when the weather is extremely hot and/or humid (I'm an incredibly sweaty person, so humidity really affects me).

I fall asleep in just about every airport I'm in, and on all planes I've ever been on.  I've fallen asleep before takeoff  before.  (In theory that's the statistical time something would go  wrong, so I should be awake  for that at least, but it's almost a Pavlov's Dog situation I just get tired once settled in and can't stop it).  

Not sure if coincidental or related, but I also don't really get jet lag.  I just sort of adapt on the fly and that first night somewhere I'm tired early, but it's because I've been traveling, not because of the time.  It's not crazy early, like my normal bedtime would be 11 pm, and I'm winding down and usually out around 10 pm.  Though home if I had a long day or an early morning, crashing out at 10 pm instead of 11pm isn't unheard of.  The next morning, I'm awake at a reasonable local hour, and ready to go.  

My main weakness is I'm tall with long limbs, tight spaces are just hard to maneuver and sit in for long periods of  time.  Now that I'm older (38), I only do premium economy on 4+ hour flights.  Anything under I can deal, it's not great but it's too short to justify the price difference, and on the super short connecting ones it's not even offered because the plane's not big enough (also for 45 minutes, I can deal with most anything).

- Huge flavor palette. I’m half Indonesian and half white, and I grew up eating foods that were always out of the ordinary. I will always be able to find something to eat. Honestly, the more different the cuisine, the more interested I become.

When I was in Basrah in 2022, the entire corniche area was under construction and in a shambles. Good to know it's been finished. It's unfortunate that you didn't see anything there-- Basrah has an interesting historic area (UNESCO World Heritage Site), a museum housed in one of Saddam's former palaces, and outside the city are the remnants of Iraq's oldest mosque (only the minaret is left).

>At a checkpoint in the city, we were told we needed an escort (safety?) but the ""helpers"" tried to scam us. 

This was my experience when I visited Samarra in '22. No one (not even Iraqis) could visit the city without hiring a driver. I took a minibus from Baghdad and tried to walk in but to no avail. Fortunately as I was waiting at the checkpoint some European tourists passed by in a taxi and offered to let me ride with them, and we visited the city together and got lunch after.

>Next day exploring on foot was an emotional experience—seeing the bullet-ridden walls and post-war reconstruction, yet life carrying on.

I visited Mosul on my first trip in '22 and then again in '24. You would not believe how much rebuilding and restoration work was done in those two years.

Hey folks, just wanted to give you all an update and thank you for all the comments, advice, and suggestions you shared. Your support made a big difference in handling this situation!

So, here’s what happened: I managed to reach the Saudia Airlines office, but it wasn’t an easy task. Their office had changed its address, and neither their website nor Google Maps had the correct information. After some local asking around, I finally figured out their new location and headed there.

Once at the office, I presented all my arguments and concerns. However, they were extremely adamant about sticking to the rescheduled flight and almost forcing me to accept it. I stayed firm and pointed out that flights were available for earlier dates, even though they were business class. Unfortunately, they outright refused to upgrade me to business class despite my situation.

After lengthy discussions and a lot of back-and-forth, I finally managed to convince them to book me on a direct flight to Frankfurt with Lufthansa instead. While I’m relieved about this outcome, there’s a small downside: my upgraded baggage add-on (which I originally purchased) became null and void. They informed me that upgraded add-ons are non-refundable and refused to entertain any refund for that.

Still, considering how stressful this situation was, I’m grateful that it’s resolved, for the most part. I wouldn’t have been able to navigate this without all the helpful advice and encouragement I received here.

Thank you all again, I truly appreciate your time and support. Wishing you all the very best in life. Take care and goodbye!",2025-04-03 06:27:08,74,NaiveCoder786,travel

You can ask them to put you on another flight they can ticket, possibly with a SkyTeam partner.

You **must follow Rule 4** and include the **cities, airports, flight numbers, airlines**, and **dates of travel**.

If your flight originated from the EU (any carrier) or your destination was within the EU (with an EU carrier), read into [EC261 Air Passenger Rights](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/passenger-rights/air/index_en.htm). Non-EU to Non-EU itineraries, even if operated by an EU carrier, is not eligible for EC261 per Case C-451/20 ""Airhelp vs Austrian Airlines"". In the case of connecting flights covered by a single reservation, if at least one of the connecting flights was operated by an EU carrier, the connecting flights as a whole should be perceived as operated by an EU air carrier - see [Case C367/20](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=233901&pageIndex=0&doclang=en&mode=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=676147) - may entitle you to compensation even if the non-EU carrier (code-shared with the EU carrier) flying to the EU causes the overall delay in arrival if the reservation is made with the EU carrier.

If your flight originated in the UK (any carrier) or your destination was within the UK (with a UK or EU carrier), or within the EU (on a UK carrier), read into [UK261 by the UK CAA](https://www.caa.co.uk/passengers/resolving-travel-problems/delays-and-cancellations/making-a-claim/). **Note**: this includes connecting flights from a non-UK origin to non-UK destination if flown on a UK carrier (British Airways or Virgin Atlantic).

Canada also has a passenger protection [known as APPR found here](https://rppa-appr.ca/eng)

If you were flying within the US or on a US carrier - you are not entitled to any compensation unless your journey was covered under the above (EC261, UK261, or APPR) schemes or if you were involuntarily denied boarding (IDB) due to overbooking.

So I have to really perform some major mental gymnastics, combine weekends, public holidays etc to ensure we get a decent vacation of at least two weeks when we travel.

We spend weeks tracking his moods to determine the best time to ask for leave. Time it wrong and you're in a world of pain. Husband will be taunted and mentally tortured for months after a vacation.

Husband gets sick worrying about how to ask for that letter of consent.

I used to create photo albums of my trips on social media, and I stopped doing that because, honestly, why would most people on social media go through 50 photos of my trip to Belgrade? I consider myself well-traveled (50+ countries on 6 continents) but even I have to admit I am not so interested in regular status updates or loads of photos of someone else’s trips - not because I’m jealous given that I’ve checked off pretty much my entire travel bucket list - but because sometimes it feels very show off-y and attention seeking. Depending of course on how it’s done. 

For me, if I share anything about a trip, it’s usually accompanied by a funny or interesting anecdote. Like a picture of a funny subway sign in Busan with a humorous tagline. Or maybe something amusing or embarrassing that happened, like the time a host family I was staying with in Turkey found out that I had a pet cat, and so sent me across the street to a stranger’s home with a plate of cherries to meet their neighbor’s new kittens. You know - things that would be interesting or amusing regardless of it being me on a trip somewhere. When I went to Iceland, for example, the only photos I posted were of me looking sad holding a poster of various whales on a failed whale watching tour in which our boat broke down and a “daily puffin” from our road trip around the fjords. People love puffins, what can I say?

Anyway… I guess I’m old enough now and confident enough in my own experiences that I no longer feel the need to show off, and if I don’t have anything to share that I think others might find interesting, I am fine enjoying it just for myself or saving it for my closest friends and family when I return.

Edit: in terms of sharing at work, I work for an international organization so it’s typical that most people travel internationally either for work or personal reasons several times a year, so it’s not a big deal or frowned upon where I work and people love sharing stories with their colleagues when they come back or bringing back sweets or other snacks/trinkets for the team when they return. So, I may be in a unique office environment :) But if I worked for a standard US company to organization I might share less… it’s sort of all about reading the room and knowing your audience and making the trip meaningful to other people. At my office, bringing things back to share is a great way to make it little less “look at me!” and more about bringing others in to share your experience in a way that’s also enjoyable for them. I just think people overall don’t like it when people make things seem mostly about themselves and a lot of travel can be - frankly - a little selfish and privileged and not everyone gets to experience it.",2025-04-08 21:39:44,1,Ouroborus13,travel

The FIRST rule of international travel is that very little will go according to plan. 

The second rule is to be flexible because very little will go according to plan. 

The third and final rule is to go easy on yourself through the trip because things will go wrong. International travel is hard. People’s first several trips abroad are the hardest because they haven’t learned to flow with all the ways things can and will go wrong. Your experience is typical of first time travelers. I’ve literally been all over the world and still feel like I’m honing my skills as a traveler.

mlzrksz,1ju6gd5,reddit,"Brotha, it happens to the best of us. You'll laugh about it later. I took my mom to Guatemala and Mexico and it was like an old Chevy Chase movie.

The airline told me she wasn't coming that day, so I didn't show up. She did. Somehow she gets to the town from the airport. Eventually they get ahold of me. When I arrive she's just standing in the street in Antigua looking panicked. Not the best start. 

Even though I sent her the itinerary to her ok, she wasn't able to do a lot of things I planned. She could barely walk around the town due to her physical condition. And there was a lot of walking and stairs to be done. It exhausted her and she tried, but you could tell she was not having much fun. 

At one point she was surprised by a scorpion in her room. Another room the massive ceiling fan fell down to chest level but kept spinning! She had to hold on for dear life going up to one of the of lava fields and was too tired to ride back down. Me and the guide had to basically carry her down.

The worst part of all, the last three days was like a beach relax time...I thought it would be a funny experience to book us a party hostel. I thought maybe we would be included, have an unexpectedly good time somehow...We all hated it. It was terrible. At one point, eating a pizza buffet with all the 18 year old British asshats, I asked my mom on a scale of one to hate this place how did she feel lol. She replied, "" I fucking hate it!""

I felt bad, as I really did want to show my mom some of the beauty in the world, which she did enjoy some, but couldn't enjoy a lot due to being in pain and exhausted. She swears she had a good, but admittedly hard, time and enjoyed it still.... We laugh a lot about it now, but I can assure you, it took some time.",2025-04-08 06:19:28,33,TriggerEatsTheWolf,travel

mm0j72e,1ju6gd5,reddit,"My older son(45) and I (F70) have traveled to many countries together (we are from USA). Since he has more travel time/miles to other countries without me, he initially planned most of our travels.  Fast forward to the last 2 Europe trips, I was more involved in the planning of the trips.  With each trip there have been hiccups; e.g. missing events because of timing, transportation, the weather (rain, wind, etc), age related issues (found out that I had arthritis; with a plan, I was still able to climb Arthur’s Seat), and being tired.  However, there have been moments of serendipity.  Example: we were in Luxembourg, it was cold and raining. We stopped under the overhang of a building to get out of the rain and check our location.  We hear drum cadences.  Turns out we were standing in front of a castle entrance and the soldiers were marching for the changing of the guards.  By slowing down; we met other travels, exchanged stories and got some insights into some additional information about the area.  

All of these is to say give yourself a break.  Being flexible is essential when traveling. Also, be comfortable with making changes to the travel plans, and maybe not doing everything on the list.  Sometimes, slow down, stop and pausing can work in your favor.  In addition, if your parents are like me and most parents (as it was mentioned above) they are happy to spend time with you.  Take what you learned from your trip(s) and apply them to your next travels.  Good luck on your next adventure.",2025-04-08 11:02:02,1,nadanuf2,travel

mm1sket,1ju6gd5,reddit,"The same happened to me last year when I also planned everything. In one city we slept in the airport for 3 nights because the hotel just gave our rooms away. We made no mistake, it was just a shitty GreenTree hotel which I booked despite bad reviews because I wanted to save money (especially for my parents; I paid separately anyway). The staff was barely able to have a normal conversation, but in their words, they sell ""1000s of rooms, but cannot respect all of the bookings"". In another city we lost a rental car, and thus a lot of money and time. Also not our fault: the rentel at Hertz tried to sell us tons of extra service, were obviously pissed off after we rejected, and then pretended that the credit card cannot be read. It worked completely fine at the next rental, but it was an on-site booking and much more expensive.

I admit, the last issue was my fault: I underestimated the daily expenses (but that's the smaller part of the overall loss).

Overall, we lost many hours, quality, and money. None of the issues was our fault, but I still felt guilty.

mlvs4x6,1jtohk1,reddit,"First trip to Europe in 1999. 20/21 years old. Traveled with 4 friends.

What was supposed to be a 2 week epic vacation to see our favorite soccer clubs and maybe some Europe tourist highlights in between, turned into a solo 3 month backpacking adventure on a budget of $3,500 - the same budget my friends said was the MINIMUM to have for their 2 week trip.

We spent that first 2 week together, but they were not convinced $3,500 could last 3 months, and luckily i'd stumbled across Rick Steves' 'Europe Through the Back Door' weeks before the trip was to start. I devoured that book in a weekend and by that following Monday was trying to convince my friends to change plans for an entire summer. None did, but I went out to buy my first backpack, a eurail pass, a $365 round-trip, open-ended, standby plane voucher, and money belt.

I met tons of other travelers like me backpacking through Europe. I saw a lot soccer with my friends. Lost a friend one week into the trip. Slept in hostels, with family, on trains, on benches, in a zoo. Was woken up by the roar of a lion. Rolled into my grandmother's home town hoping to see the home she crew up in, but finding unknown living family that welcomed into their home fro 3 days. Stayed with family on my father's side in Scotland. Spent a week at a sheep croft with my cousin's Gaelic speaking in-laws.

That trip taught me that you don't need a lot of money to travel Travel is easier and safer than so many people make it out to be. People are genuinely friendly and things tend to work out for the best even when they seem to be going wrong at the time.

For 25 years I've been chasing that trip and have been obsessed with budget European Travel. I've devoted time to help others plan similar trips over the years, and build a travel app to help people travel to Europe affordably and with confidence.

That single trip changed the trajectory of my life - for better or worse - and it was all because i found a random book in a library by 'some guy' named Rick Steves.",2025-04-07 16:03:28,199,NiagaraThistle,travel

I'm someone who has quite a bit of anxiety at times, especially social anxiety. So I did all my research, found out what I wanted to do, read that it was a safe place. People acted like I was going to an active war zone and like I was beyond reckless for going alone. Yet, I had a great time, and it's one of my favourite memories ever.


I HATE making decisions and used to ask a ton of people for opinions. It really helped me learn not to seek validation from other people on what to do with my life. That unless someone has the same goals as me or have done similar, to take advice huge grain of salt. Different people want different things from life, nbd. 


Gotta think about what you want, research, then be confident enough to chase your dreams. It's given me the confidence to do other things out of my comfort zone that I would never have done if I listened to people that actually haven't done said things.

mlw8y53,1jtohk1,reddit,"First trip was a 10 day solo trip to Ireland when I was 17 in the mid 2000s coming from the American PNW. I still remember the smell of the phone cards, the giddy mania of pre recession Ireland, and the utter, bone-deep certainty that every hostel would have a bed ready and waiting and open just for me. Nothing booked. Nothing planned. No friends or family or streetwise talking dogs to meet me on O'Connell Street. It was a wonderful, chaotic, bumpy trip, and one of the seminal experiences of my life. 


I think travel is most life changing when it's like breaking a bone you didn't know you had. When it's painful, and even scary, but you heal back stronger. For me, some of that was luck, and being young and stupid and less set in my ways, but what I have found since is that I can tap into that feeling on occasion by going a little limp and seeing where the currents of Granada or Trastevere or Ebisu take me. 


We never transform in the ways we think. A place is never its postcard or online review. So I think things get most impactful when we step outside of what usually drives us and allow for something else; often, that means ambiguity and discomfort and confusion, but in this era of profound creature comforts, that kind of experience in of itself can enliven the blood. All of this should be within reason, of course, and within the bounds of one's own gut feelings around physical safety, be smart, do your research, but be open too.


Travel can be nice. It can be comfortable and curious. That's ok. Not every trip need be Kerouac on a steamer to far and noble Zanzibar. The world is wide. But I think we shift into that marrow-drinking gear best when we realize it's not enough for difference to wash over us passively, but that we must take the prompting of a wild and novel place to be a little different ourselves. ",2025-04-07 17:29:16,6,Outrageous-Table6524,travel
mlzj9dr,1jtohk1,reddit,"**Canada, winter 2017**.  Specifically, **Calgary** (roughly the 4th most popular city) and **Yellowknife** (a small town famous for northern lights aurora viewing).

It was my honeymoon trip.  It went like Calgary > Yellowknife > Calgary because we got good deals on both round trips.  After that trip, Calgary is my favorite city I've visited in terms of livability and Yellowknife is eye-opening. 

Coming in from Asia, the usual midway stop before Yellowknife was either Calgary or Vancouver.  Calgary was picked because I had a highschool buddy there I hadn't seen in years.  It was fun when I reunite with him but also, the city was just such a good blend of city and nature with a good amount of space for everybody.

My friend also took us to **Banff** for a day trip.  I should not need to describe how beautiful Banff is.  That said, it was winter when we went and Banff was all white.  I can't wait to go back when I get a chance for a summer visit.

Yellowknife was a new experience for us.  As someone from a top tier east Asian city that's always warm and overcrowded, the small town life and the quiet and frozen winter was refreshing.  Combine that with colorful lights and thousands of stars in the nightsky for no reason, they imprint into our minds that life could be simple and still very enjoyable.

mlxv5az,1jtohk1,reddit,"Two come to mind, specifically:

My first time in Scotland.  I did a study aboard for the summer between my junior and senior year of college.  I'd traveled before, been international before, butt never that far and never on my own (to somewhere other than driving distance within my own State, which California is huge, but that's still different, and my out of State college years thus far (Oregon)).   

I did so much, I saw so much, I learned so much, I took trains all over the place, I flew to Dubiln for a long weekend, I studied some.  Europe is just so old compared to the US, and West coast even more so, with so much history.  I was always independent and knew solo travel would likely be my path most of the time (it has been), but it was the first time I'd done so.  And I went big.  The second time was also awesome but for different reasons.  

More recently, last summer, Alaska.   My god that place is just so freaking beautiful.  And huge.  So huge.   I'm from California so I get big, but Alaska is just enormous.   We saw  the tiniest bit of it and just got a taste, and yet even  that tiny bit was so vast and wonderful.  It really settled that I want to live in a place where I can see nature and mountains like you can from Anchorage.  You're in a ""real"" city, city life, conveniences, reasonable commutes (I'm in  office work), but go ten, fifteen, even twenty minutes outside of town and you're in true wilderness.  That's just so amazing.  Such a unique place.  I want to go back and see more, I know I'll never see it all but anymore would be worth it.   Also the Cabella's was totally cool.

Honorable mention, since it hasn't happened yet but I know it's going to be on this list once it does: next week I fly to Japan for the first time.  Talk about a whole different world than I'm used to.  How, we'll have to see, but I just know it's going to be one hell of an adventure.",2025-04-07 22:34:37,2,blueberry_pancakes14,travel

After chatting all night, I found out he was in the same room as me and that we would be taking the same ferry to the North Island the next day. He was taking his car on the ferry, I was not. We kissed, and he mentioned he got us a room in a hostel (I didn't have a place to stay yet). Since I was heading to Auckland and he was heading the same way, he offered a ride. We ended up following each other on Facebook (yes, in the good ol' days) and he stayed in Auckland and I went back to Abu Dhabi.

An opportunity came for me to visit a friend in Melbourne, so I jumped on it. Since my guy was in NZ (we kept in touch through Facebook), I casually asked 'Do you want to meet up in Melbourne?' to which he replied yes. I was shocked. 

So we met up and drove down to the Great Ocean Road. By this time, we had been keeping in touch for 6 months and we asked each other where do we go from here. So I told him to come live with me in Abu Dhabi and I could  try to find him a job.

There was an attraction but it's a holiday...no one takes it serious. We exchanged numbers as we'd gone to the bar for live music and it was cancelled short notice so he said he'd let us know when they were perform.

Casually talked and I think he met me and my friend with his friends for drinks once. We returned to the bar a couple of times as he'd informed they were definitely gonna have live music. They didn't the first time but him and his friend were apologetic and gave us free food and drinks. Day before we left he promised the group would be there and they were. We had a lock in with a few others which was fun but we couldn't find him to say ""bye"". He turned up at our hotel and took us out as like a last night goodbye (paid for our drinks too). We shared a hug, nothing more and didn't think much of it. 

He'd text occasionally and then he invited me out for a massive festival they had. Told me, if accommodation was gonna be an issue I could stay with his family and I'd have my own room etc. Went back out with a different friend (we stayed in a hotel) and the festival was amazing. We hung out loads and maybe a couple of nights before we left we were sitting outside my hotel just chilling and he kissed me and told me ""he really liked me and wanted to give an LDR a try but didn't know how I felt"". I said I liked him and was open to see where it went.

Went back home and communication was more regular and he wanted me to meet his family properly and invited me for Christmas. It was lovely and his family were so welcoming. He then told me ""one day I'm gonna marry you"" - I laughed and was like ""sure, we'll see""

More fool me! He proposed Jan 2022, we got married in October 2022 and are still together.

He has a good relationship with my family and I do with his.

1. She was my flight attendant. I’m an okay looking and reasonably charismatic guy, but not so much that a flight attendant would chat me up, but she was so attentive, asking me lots of questions about my life and at the end of the flight asked for social details. My ego was very well stroked.

Added her on social media and saw we had like 50 friends in common (and I only had like 60 friends). Turns out we went to school together and I failed to recognise her.

Only relationship I’ve ever had where my partner could keep up with my travel schedule - I was travelling near full time and her airline flew to all 6 continents so despite us living in the same city it was usually much easier for us to meet overseas.

2. Met a girl on a wine tour in Argentina. She was Uruguayan and told me that the wine in Uruguay was better, so I absconded to Uruguay with her for a few days. It was a great few days and I really liked her but never thought of it as more than a fling.

I reached out to her a few years later during the Covid lockdown, as I did with most of my international friends. Turns out she was travelling Australia on a working holiday visa and was locking down in a small town very near mine.

mo8w3by,1k41buy,reddit,"First thing, there is an element of fantasy, of wishfullfillment, of something being ""curated"" for insta or hobby communities (and travel and packing is a hobby community). There is a kind of showing-off also, of going more hardcore, more extreme in say packing light which is not necessarily realistic - and not just if people do not want to stink but also, a different matter, of it being weather appropriate and comfortable! A lot of layouts in heronebag are just totally off for weather or pavement styles or pickpocket security and all and can be profoundly naïve.

So take those 3 tops only thing with a grain of salt, and if they are doing it for real they might well different hygiene standards than you and me.  For me clean underwear, clean tshirt, and clean socks, and a shower everyday please is just necessary and I would not enjoy myself if I was feeling all grimey and sticky.

But since it is not feasible for long trips to take everything, yeah a mix of the above. Washing in the sink - try to get a travel clothespeg hanger thingie (it can be really cheap and it is flat. And if it is cheap you can leave it behind without regret) dry a lot better and can dry neater. But choose items carefully, and I do not mean for the insta or for the trend, choose picks you know dry well, do not need to ironed. And this is not cool this time of the year where you are seeing all those all white and so so white capsule wardrobes but be careful with light colors or shiney light fabrics, they stain easily and it can be impossible to scrub out the stain on a sink. 

I always pack a couple more underwear, a couple more socks, an extra tshirt or two (always always a short sleeved t, and a long sleeved tee, no matter where I am going).

If you're going to learn one, Russian would probably be more helpful than Turkish (although I was surprised at the relative lack of Russian outside of cities). But if you already speak some Turkish it helps.

mnfxym1,1k0pu85,reddit,"Honestly it is a problem in some cities / areas, and I don't want this to come across as 'victim blaming' because people should be able to travel and enjoy visiting places without falling victim to these scum. However...

A lot of it can be avoided with basic common sense. When I was last in Prague, for example, we were walking across Charles Bridge on a busy day - so prime pickpocketing weather - and still see tourists (a group of American girls in this case) walking along with iPhones half sticking out of their back pockets. I mean you can't be surprised when it gets stolen if you're going to be that blasé, honestly..

Best advice is 1. keep your valuables (phone, wallet, keys, in a zipped pocket or bag, and keep your hand firmly over the zip when you're in a crowded or busy area; 2. don't walk around with your phone casually in your hand, or stand using it in an open / crowded place - basically any situation where it could be easily grabbed by someone passing by (leaving phones and bags on street café / restaurant tables is another obvious one).

I'd advise against wearing or carrying any particularly obviously valuable items too - I mean everyone has expensive phones nowadays so that's generally expected, but eg. I wouldn't walk around London, Paris, or Rome wearing a Rolex or carrying a Hermes bag (my partner for that one, not me).

They'll always go for the easiest target / opportunity, so just basic measures and common sense to ensure you're not that target, you'll more than likely be fine.",2025-04-16 17:27:05,41,IC3Ky,travel

I’ve been pickpocketed twice in my life. The first time in Madrid. Annoyingly, my friend had been walking round all day with her bag open, I kept telling her to be careful. I walked through a busy area in the evening, bag across my chest, had my hand on it. I tucked my hair behind my ear and when I put my hand down my bag was open and my wallet gone. 

The second time was on the subte (metro) in Buenos Aires. Two men working together. One acting weird as a distraction. I had a larger bag on my shoulder, tucked right under my arm. He broke the zip and managed to get his hand in and unzip the inner pocket and get my wallet. I felt a tug on my bag but he did it as the train went round a bend as if he fell and steadied himself. From the front my bag was still zipped up so I didn’t notice until we got off.

My advice is to only keep what you absolutely need on you. I always take bank card and a credit card for emergencies and I keep that separately. Make sure you have phone numbers for your bank to cancel your cards etc. 

It can happen to even the most careful people and it feels like such a big deal at the time, but it’s not the end of the world. It’s a pain in the ass to report it and cancel cards etc, it makes you feel vulnerable but ultimately it’s not worth letting it ruin your trip.

mng2jx6,1k0pu85,reddit,"So first, don't worry too much. There are a few cities - Barcelona is one - that have serious pickpocket problems. I've never seen active pickpockets in London or Paris. 

Since you're worrying about this, one of your priorities is to control your worrying more than to prevent pickpocketing. I've observed Americans having much less fun in Europe that they could because they're taking insane precautions, like avoiding public transport. Don't do that. Keep your passports and a credit card in the hotel room safe, and make sure you have travel insurance. Then if anything does happen, the consequences are limited. Consider using a cheap pay as you go phone instead of your iPhone Pro Max if losing it would be a big problem for you.

On actual precautions, just don't carry your valuables in a purse/handbag or backpack. Use a zip-up body bag or belt bag that goes in front and cannot be snatched, or use inside pockets on clothing or your front pants pockets. Avoid the outside pockets of jackets or back pockets of pants, since you may not notice stuff being slipped out of them. Obviously, don't leave your stuff or a bag with your stuff in it somewhere where it can be snatched, like on a table or over the back of a chair",2025-04-16 17:48:38,5,No-Wrongdoer-7654,travel

You can tailor your risk avoidance strategy accordingly.

mnhigsy,1k0pu85,reddit,"I went to Europe last summer and here are the precautions I took:

I bought a purse from Travel-On that was made especially to deter pickpockets.  The zipper pull on the main compartment has a clip to clip the zipper closed.  Then there are zippered pockets inside the main zippered pocket.  Knowing that pickpockets have probably purchased these anit-theft purses to practice on, I made sure my hand was over the zipper while I walked around.  When I was on the train wrangling my suitcase as well as my cross body purse, I used a small TSA lock to lock the purse closed in addition to locking the suitcase.  On public transportation, they like to cause a diversion to get people's attention, then strike.

I bought a ""leash"" for my phone and one end was clipped to the inside of my purse and I kept my phone in my purse unless I was using it.  And I was careful of my surroundings when I had my phone out.  You could also attach the leash to a belt loop on your pants so you could keep it in your pocket.

I purchased some shorts and pants with zippered pockets.  Because I was taking some pants that didn't have zippered pockets, I also bought some blouses that are really long - they hang halfway down to my knees.  It's not a guarantee that a pickpocket won't lift my blouse to get at my pockets, but it's a deterrent. 

I was hit by a pickpocket only once - at the main train station in Milan.  However, the pants I was wearing at the time (with a blouse that hung only a few inches below my waist) had one small zippered pocket sewn into the waistband and the guy bumped into me hard at my hip level where there were no pockets.

Also, twist ties are a deterrent.  Anything that will slow down a pickpocket is a deterrent.  Keep in mind the things that pickpockets want most:  money, electronics and passports.

Also, there are a number of YouTube videos on what to watch out for.

Have a great trip and with using precautions, you shouldn't have any problems.",2025-04-16 22:12:51,2,SagebrushID,travel

So, my suggestion is: don't carry money in one place - hang on the neck pouch (the little purse for documents, whatever it is called) some documents that you should put under the tshirt and wear lose clothing. If you carry stuff like crossover messenger bag, make sure it is in front of you, across your body, hold the front when entering traffic. 

Your pants: have many pockets that no one can easily access. Inner pockets with zippers in pants are best. 

Have a funny pack if that works better for you. 

In a backpack only carry stuff like food, water, clothes. Put a funny sticker on it: nothing to steal in this backpack except an old sweater, water and some food. Or something like that.

mnh1fuu,1k0pu85,reddit,"This is honestly the most ridiculous Reddit thread I've ever read and full of terrible advice, such as:

* ""Just use common sense"" - pickpocketing only happens in a few cities around the world whose residents represent a very tiny proportion of the global population, and most people worldwide never have to even think of the possibility of ever being pickpocketed in their lives. They certainly aren't ever taught about it by anyone unless they have very close relatives or friends who have been to those specific touristy cities. It's honestly something that would never even occur to them, despite the fact that in your mind it's ""common sense.""

* ""Don't use your phone"" - are you serious? Do you understand that tourists aren't going to have a map of every street in your city memorized? This is a great way to waste your vacation.

* ""Look confident"" - not easy to do when you're in a new country; not easy to judge on yourself; definitely not something that most people can pull off

* ""Don't be a stupid clueless tourist"" - just because someone didn't grow up in a limited number of touristy cities in Europe and isn't used to having to worry about pickpocketing doesn't make them stupid. We Americans don't think that Europeans from large cities with adequate public transportation who don't drive are stupid - we think it's great that they don't have to! 

* ""Wear a coat at all times to hide your possessions"" - fine if it's actually winter, but winter is only a few months out of the year, and people tend to travel when the weather is warmer - even if you were to wear a coat in the heat of summer to conceal your belongings, you would ironically look exactly like the stupid tourists people on here are criticizing

* ""Wear sophisticated clothing"" - as a person who does do this and doesn't dress like a typical American at all, I have plenty of criticisms regarding how typical Americans dress and would tend to agree, but expecting people who've dressed a certain way their whole lives to suddenly study fashion and buy a whole new wardrobe for a trip that's already very expensive for them just isn't realistic

I've been to 37 countries and here's what works: 
* Theft-proof bags with locking zippers
* Luggage locks for backpacks
* Necklace wallets
* Phone lanyards 
* Bringing several debit and credit cards and only taking one out with you, leaving the rest in your locked luggage in your hotel

mnh94jp,1k0pu85,reddit,"I’ve been robbed at knifepoint once, had a phone stolen once, and evaded theft many times. I do travel a lot, to lots of dodgy places, so the odds catch you out. Often, it’s the places I’m most familiar with where I’ve stupidly let my guard down. 

Lots of good advice here. Top tips are having zipped or, even better Velcro pockets. Carry a cheap dummy wallet as a throwaway with those useless notes left over from another trip, and some folding cash and one credit card hidden elsewhere. Those silly hidden waistbelts do work if you’re discreet enough using them.

i choose travelling trousers with good, deep pockets and at least one secure one for a phone. 5/11 cargo pants are great - lots of Velcro on dropped hip pockets which are a pickpocket’s nightmare. Quick drying too.

Carry a local plastic supermarket bag-for-life with a shoulder strap, and keep your own camera or other bag hanging inside that with its own shoulder strap. Looks are everything and no one wants to steal your groceries. 

Don’t carry a backpack without expecting it to be slit or unzipped from behind  — carry it in front. At the very least, throw it over one shoulder and keep switching it. Face oncoming traffic to make it harder for snatchers on bikes.",2025-04-16 21:21:37,1,Plastic_Indication91,travel

Philippines Story time (warning, might be a bit of a humble brag..I promise, nobody clapped, I was still a drunk asshole, but I figure I made some kids day a tiny bit brighter):

Many moons ago, the PI had tons, and I mean lots, of roving kid gangs. Usually homeless or whatnot, they would band together to harass tourist for money, gifts, or food. Not sure if its still that way, but it was back in 2015. So, one day while walking through a market, some kids came up to me asking for money..smacking the hand and everything. They were ready....The oldest was probably about 12 and the youngest was around 4-5(?), out of about 7 kids. I looked at them, not really wanting to say NO, knowing that optics are a thing, and also knowing that its always best to walk away and ignore them. 

  
This time, and because I was shit faced, I directly asked them ""hey, what do yall want...food or money?"" Basically all of them except one wanted the food...so, I went to the first food vender I saw, gave him about 500 peso and asked if he could cook up a lot of food for the kids, of which the other venders in the area having seen the event take place, kind of..nodded in agreement. And oh boy, he gave them A LOT of food...After they were sat down and started eating, I left...

And yes, this is the first time im sharing this story specifically because it comes off as humble-bragging or just out right bragging..but i see it like this....as a tourist going to a less fortunate country, in a less developed area, we all have some duty at being good ambassadors.

Anyway my parents were worried about us so they booked us a car from the airport to our hotel and it turned out to be this big burly celebrity bodyguard-looking dude named Tony (suit, sunglasses, the whole stereotypical look bless him).

Turns out he was an avid fisherman and was SO HYPED to meet someone from this nowhere town that was apparently on his bucket list. He pulls out an envelope of photos he'd just had developed from his latest fishing trip, he's like ""you guys gotta see these, I know you girls aren't squeamish about fish!"" since we're country girls and all.

Like most Canadians don't even know where our town is so the fact that some driver in LA knew exactly where it was and that it's surrounded by lakes that are a fisherman's dream, is endlessly funny to me.

mnd8xi4,1jzt486,reddit,"Here’s the story of how a bowl of soup cured possibly the worst hangover of my life.

It was a sunny afternoon on my last day in Valencia. I was miserably hungover from drinking agua de Valencia the night before and hadn’t eaten a thing all day. Just the thought of food turned my stomach. I was wandering the city one last time before heading to the airport when I spotted an old man, probably in his 80s or 90s, serving bowls of steaming hot soup to himself and two friends from a large pot.

I didn’t think I was hungry, but I couldn’t take my eyes off that soup. I’m not sure I’ve ever wanted or needed anything more.

After they served themselves, I saw there was still plenty left. In my disheveled, hungover state, I shuffled over and, in my broken, gibberish Spanish, asked one of the men, “How does one get lucky enough to eat the soup?” He smiled and said, “You have to be our friend.”

So I asked, “How does one become a friend?”

He replied, “You are already our friend,” and handed me his untouched bowl.

I tried to decline, but he insisted, saying he wasn’t very hungry because he’d had a big breakfast. I wasn’t about to argue, so I gratefully took it.

That was without a doubt the best dish I had during my 2.5 week trip through Spain, and that’s saying a lot. I couldn’t stop blowing chef’s kisses to the old man himself. And yes, I had seconds. Of course I overate. Somehow, that magical soup didn’t just cure my hangover. It brought me fully back to life. Just moments earlier, I had been dragging my feet through the streets like a zombie. After the soup, I felt human again.

The old Valencian chef even invited me to their luncheon the next day, but since it was my last day, I promised I’d return. Maybe even surprise them one day. I made him promise he would stay well and healthy until then.

I still wonder if it was the kindness of the three amigos or the magic in that soup that healed not just my hangover, but something deeper. Maybe both. Either way, I still dream about that bowl of soup and the unexpected warmth I was shown.",2025-04-16 06:25:50,2,pokepokiepokapop,travel
mndgpyb,1jzt486,reddit,"A hiking buddy I met on the Alta Via 1 and I juuust missed the bus which only comes every 2 hours, after finishing the trail so instead of waiting to get back to Belluno, we decided to hitchhike. After about ten minutes, a man named Giulio pulls off and picks us up. He was on his way back to Belluno after a camping trip with his son. 

We get to chatting and he loves telling us about traveling in Italy which he has done extensively. I ask him for tips on Venice which I had not planned at all and spontaneously decided to join my hiking friends on the same day. 

He asks how long I'm going for and I tell him 2 nights. He says ""ah, if it was longer I would've sent you to my sister in Lido"" which is an island connected to Venice but a bit far away if you're there for a short time. This kind man who picked up two dirty hitchhikers was willing to send me to be hosted by his sister after chatting to me for 15 minutes. 

I was so glad I had decided for the first time (and I will be doing this going forward as well) to take little packets of Biltong (dried spiced meat) along with me as gifts for instances like this. When I asked him to wait as I had something to give him, after he dropped us off and I started rummaging through my backpack, he quickly said ""nonono"" because he thought I was going to give him money.

*I went to Hurghada with another female friend of mine, instead of staying at hotels or resorts we opted for an Airbnb in a higher end residential apartment complex.
We only ate at restaurants/cafes which had good reviews on Google, ordered from Talabat many times and had zero stomach issues. I avoided drinks with ice in it, and drank so much fresh juice. Ate all kinds of fruit and salads with no issues. Although later i got to know my coffee was made with tap water and i drank that two times a day 😅
I only got ripped off one time, with a vape i brought which was supposed to be 1000 puffs but finished in half a day. It might not be the sellers fault,because he opened the package in front of me. 
Before i brought anything i checked the price on Talabat (which is generally more expensive because its a delivery app) and never paid anything more than the price on the app. 
Used Uber everywhere with card payment,never took local taxis.
Instead of buying a sim card at the airport,i brought one in the city at the Orange store for the same price they listed on their website.
Got 7GB internet package with sim card for 250 egp or something. 
The hustlers didn't bother me much, they are just doing their job,why hate on them? 
Just don't engage, and keep on walking.
At Karnak Temple we got approached by a security guard offering to take our pictures which we didn't want at first but somehow he managed to take my phone and snap a few pictures, well i got a few okay-ish pictures and paid nothing to him,because thats not how it works.
Never spoken to any taxi driver,wait staff or shop keeper outside of the necessity, and definitely didn't smile or joked/laughed with any man. Kept the talking brief and maintained a stone face at all times. Never got harassed.
I had a really amazing vacation ❤️

Everyone on the tour besides me was retired. VEEEERY up there in age. One Asian woman and her daughter were on the trip, her daughter was maybe late 20s, making her the closest to my age. It was very isolating not having anyone I could relate to, not speaking the local language much, and not having my SO with me. I did speak with several in the group, and we got along well enough, but still.
I will probably try to book a hostel, but the price for an individual room is the same as a hotel, and I still have to share the bathroom, based on the ones I've looked at so far. That's a deal breaker for me vs a full size hotel room with private bathroom, spacious shower, and/or a soaking tub. So we'll see. I've had decent luck just asking locals about things at restaurants or bars and they've been very happy to educate me on local cuisine and things to see, so that's a starting point. ",2025-04-06 12:20:32,2,by_a_pyre_light,travel

When I'm in the Caribbean for example, it's a lot of just chilling out and hanging out in town...and throw a couple of days of scuba in, doing some hiking if applicable. If I'm in London or Paris or something like that...yeah, I'm probably going to go see the sites and do the tourist things because I'm not likely to get back there anytime in the near future and I guess I would feel kind of weird going to London just to go out for coffee.

Even with tourist/site seeing vacations, I think there has to be a happy medium. I think that we as Americans can sometimes just try to shove too much shit into a short time given that most of us don't have a ton of vacation time...and doing things like flying half way across the planet is expensive and most of us aren't able to do that on the regular...but my wife has taught me to a large extent to slow it down and if we miss something we miss something and that we'll see this and we'll see that, but we don't need to be on the go all day everyday.",2025-04-07 20:56:31,1,Wolf_E_13,travel

A week after I got home I got a £400 bill through for a taxi. 

I disputed this with Amex and they got the details and it said I had a taxi from the airport to Eilat. 

I opened a dispute and showed them I’d left the country a week before the supposed taxi ride so obviously it wasn’t me. 

Anyway a year of back and forth with Amex and they refused to back down so I ended up having to pay. It fucked my credit score up as well as they kept putting the charge as a legitimate fee and I kept not paying it and opening the dispute up again. 

In the end I got so fucking bored of Amex utter incompetence that I just paid it to make the issue go away.

Many small towns have parks and playground equipment (if it hasn’t yet been updated to modern safer alternatives) that can be a bit sketchy and therefore extra fun.

Businesses like hardware stores and pharmacies will have new old stock of outdated wares. I enjoy taking a walk through those types of shops. You can tell a lot about a community from their hardware store…and also thrift and antique stores.

mjswr87,1jk6tle,reddit,"I spend 6+ months away from the uk, mostly Asia and am prescribed over ten cardiac meds for daily dosing (which, whilst staring down the barrels of 60yo doesn’t stop me from hooning round India on trains with a backpack like a Zoomer on a gap year- people take note if you think you’re ‘too old’ or it’s ‘too late’). 

You’re correct, the NHS will give you 12 weeks supply of most meds. You’ve a couple of options and they’re all finance dependent. Most obvious is to engineer it that you’re close enough to nip back home without breaking the bank and collect another 12 weeks or if it’s not a chore get them there.

You could also get a private consultation and private prescription in the uk before leaving for the *next* twelve weeks but that’s comparatively pricey. 

If you’re going to Asia first I’d do a little research & seek out a good medical centre (and contrary to ~~~Reddit~~~ popular perception there’s *plenty* of top-notch medical facilities) soon after you arrive and consult a doc who’ll be happy to sort you out and supply you from the unit’s pharmacy. That’s what I do, then I’ve six months supply, ready to roll and peace of mind. 

Beware: in much of Asia unscrupulous pharmacists will sometimes supply you with whatever the fuck you want, for the right price. Whilst this can be handy for a cheeky Xanax after three sleepless nights of cars honking and dogs barking, do **NOT** be tempted to short-cut the doctors consultation in this regard, in some places ~60% of meds on sale have been found to be counterfeit. Whilst this doesn’t mean they aren’t what they purport to be it’s not worth taking the risk. A reputable unit will see you right though. Thailand & Vietnam for example, you’ve no worries. Cambodia and India, buyer beware but both of those countries also  have *excellent* medical facilities nonetheless. Local knowledge is valuable.

The ""excessive mold infestation"" is a strip of mold about 10 cm long on the bathroom baseboard underneath the sink. The ""structural damage"" are two holes in the wall for cable and telephone lines; calling that structural damage is a huge exaggeration. The ""broken plumbing"" is what appears to be a slow-draining sink. Regarding the 40 steps, unless they claimed that the room you booked was accessible-compliant for those with mobility issues, that's kind of your fault for assuming and not doing research.

It doesn't look like a nice place to stay for the price you paid (although it was Santorini in peak season), but there's a difference between a substandard accommodation and being legally entitled to a refund. I think your case falls in the former.",2025-04-11 20:33:29,60,AppleWrench,travel

mmkxjoa,1jwru1j,reddit,"Story time, myself and a friend went to Spain a few years ago. We live in different cities, but we planned it to have the same connecting flight out of Minneapolis, and were to meet up there.

I booked my flights direct with the airline, and he booked his through Expedia. Without going into irrelevant details, we both barely missed our flights that morning, in that our respective planes hadn't left yet but we both arrived to our respective airports too late to get through security on time.

The ticket agent at the airport I was at was able to get me on the next flight to Minneapolis, and only charged me the cost of the flight for that one leg, and I was able to keep the second leg as if nothing happened. My friend, however, had to pay for his entire flight again which was $$$ for buying a ticket on the spot, and the airline didn't get him out until the next day. In the end, he paid a small fortune to get to Madrid, and missed a day on top of it.

I realize that neither one of us should have shown up to the airport late, but the point of the story is, how much the airline can help depending on if the tickets were bought direct or through an external site. Customer service that can actually solve problems is more valuable to me than saving a couple of dollars by using those sites. If you made it this far, thanks for reading lol

Edit to add, also a shoutout to KLM. I once missed a flight out of Toronto going to Manchester. I called their customer service line, told them I'm an idiot and I can't read a calendar, and help?? They got me on a flight out the next day, but I had to go to Glasgow instead. Absolutely acceptable. And they only charged me for a ticket change instead of an entire new flight. I asked for nothing, feeling stupid and thinking I'd have to buy a new ticket, but the lady at the other end of that phone call restored my faith in humanity for a little while.",2025-04-11 15:48:37,12,2948337,travel

mkixbzk,1jndg7u,reddit,"A lot has to do with the ingredients, their seasonality, and their freshness.

My experience is all within Europe, but for example tomatoes don't grow easily in the UK, and what you get in the supermarket tastes of nothing year-round, unless you buy the top-of-the-range on-the-vine, organic, etc... The reason it's year round is because the UK supermarkets will import from Spain, Morocco, Argentina, etc, as the year goes around, and especially the cheap range gets brought in chilled from far away.

By contrast, go to Greece, and any mini market or stall will have AMAZING tomatoes at the heart of summer. They've been grown down the road with loads of sunlight, they're in season, picked hours/days ago, never seen a fridge, etc. You literally can't get bad tomatoes then. But in winter? Lots of places won't sell tomatoes, and for those that do (supermarkets) the situation is like the UK, tomatoes are all tasteless coming from other countries.


My guess is that the US is like the UK and you don't really experience the seasonality of things as much, because the supermarkets change their suppliers: but the constant is that the ""cheap range"" will always be chilled shit from away",2025-03-30 14:49:43,109,Stamagar,travel

mkj2i0m,1jndg7u,reddit,"I'm American but have lived in Japan for most of my adult life. Whenever I go back to the US to visit, these are my takeaways about American food. I'm leaving stuff like portion sizes and other cultural stuff out.

\- Food at restaurants is generally good, but often very salty.

\- Produce tastes ""watered down"". Tomatoes, asparagus, mushrooms, and especially fruit seem to only have 50% of the taste in them. I suppose it's because of being genetically modified to have a longer shelf life. I don't consider that unhealthy or anything, it's just not as satisfying. Fresh fruit is really expensive in Japan so I always buy a lot to snack on when I visit the states, but it's never satisfying.

\- Chocolate is mostly disgusting, it smells like and faintly tastes like vomit. I've heard it's due to a preservative used in the US. I NEVER noticed this growing up, but after being away for a few years and opening a bag of Hershey's kisses I immediately noticed.

\- Meat quality is different than what I'm used to in Japan, but I think it's more cultural. Americans tend to like really lean meat, which is considered tough and gross to much of the world. It seems rubbery and tasteless to me now. I totally get where your Polish friends were coming from, if I didn't know better I might think it's fake.

\- Eggs are so weird, they're like bright light yellow. I haven't noticed a difference in taste though.

\- Sweets are SO sweet, like super fucking sweet. Soda also seems sweeter. I think it's the HFCS content maybe?

\- (Edit) Another comment reminded me, milk products taste much ""milkier"" here. I'm actually lactose-intolerant to a degree so I don't often drink milk, but the times I have I remember thinking, damn, this is what milk is supposed to taste like! They don't really sell lowfat milk in Japan, so whenever you have a latte or something it's full fat milk. It just tastes very strong in comparison to what I remember having at school lunch in the US.

There are American things that I can't wait to have upon landing though, like Mexican (ha) and good BBQ. And despite the high sugar content, I have a soft spot for those Wal-Mart sugar cookies with the frosting and sprinkles.",2025-03-30 15:17:38,9,yokizururu,travel

The most top of mind example I can think of is Vietnam. Vietnamese food outside of Vietnam just isn't the same. It's a combination of environment, ingredients, and preparation methods, and I've never seen it replicated. Thai food is very similar for me as well. Add to that dishes that just don't get made outside of the country, and that the dishes that do always get adjusted for local tastes and, yeah, it tastes different there.

mkiyfe5,1jndg7u,reddit,"Prepared foods yes, raw ingredients no when you're comparing equal freshness 

People who think that food inherently tastes better when they travel are usually people that can't/don't cook and aren't used to eating such fresh meals, or they're eating cuisines and seasonings that they're not used to

I live in Canada, used to live in the US, and I cook 90% of my food fresh my scratch with minimal use of highly processed stuff. I don't find food to be univerally better when I travel, and in some places it's actually (i have to go to Scandinavia every year for work, and i find their food to be way oversalted and way underseasoned compared to what i get locally in Montreal). When i find food is better when traveling, it's due to things like better techniques (like obviously in Italy they have better pasta-making skills than in Canada) and the use of ingredients that aren't widely available where I live (like a type of cactus I ate in Mexico)

Another factor is freshness. Produce tastes better when it's fresher, and the closer you live to warm agriculture zones the fresher things will be. For example in much of Europe, produce is traveling a much shorter distance to the store than in most of Canada, so most of their stuff tastes better. But it's not any better when compared to equally fresh things, like the stuff I get from a local farm in the summer. In that same vein, when I've traveled to California I also find their produce way better than what I can get in Canada or even northern Europe, and on-par with southern & central Europe. Another example, the worst grocery shopping experience ive ever had was Bermuda in the winter, which is an isolated island where everything has to get shipped in super long distance",2025-03-30 14:55:45,5,purplepineapple21,travel

Its hard to find local produce unless you specifically search for it.  Generally, produce from far away is picked early and artificially ripened or uses varieties better for shipping than flavor.  Meat in general I find the same with the exception of a lot more lamb than in the US.  In terms of eating out, I think it depends - you can find much more variety in the US but the quality varies just as much.

Now is a great time to learn to drive. You say that you have some friends who drive. Head out of the city for a few weekends and let them teach you how to drive in some quiet areas. I think you will find it to be not as hard as you are imagining it to be. I learned to drive in high school in driver’s education class. Our total time behind the wheel was no more than 6-10 hours (it was a long time ago so I can’t remember exactly). After that get a book to help you with the written test. Practice with a friend, study for the test, and go try for your license.

Now, since you are not a citizen (I assume), there may be some requirements I am not aware of. If so, I apologize for this suggestion.

However, I believe you have time to accomplish this goal before summer. Once you have your license, exploring the US will really open up opportunities for you.

The difficulty is going to be the small towns you want to visit. There won't be a consistent answer for those; options vary greatly based on destination. I'm in Seattle, so I'll use that as an example. For smaller towns on the Olympic Peninsula, you can often take a ferry from Seattle that will connect with transit on the other side of the water and get you to a lot of places. Not every place, but a fair number.

For other destinations, you may be able to take transit to the furthest station and get friends to do some of the drive to pick you up.

Most downtowns will have enough of their tourism activities downtown, a light rail or circular bus route that serves the nighlife district, the museums, hotels, etc... and probably the airport as well. Should you stay in Detroit for 2 weeks without a car? Probably not, but perfectly fine for a jam packed weekend.

If you are trying to reach nature without a car, you're going to be much more limited and would need to do your research.

The northeast was settled much earlier before the founding of the National Park system, so most of the major parklands in PA, New York, etc and the New England states are going to be state parks rather than federal land.

The Midwest is kind of similar but does have some national parkland. Its mostly national monuments and national forests but there are some National Parks like Cuyahoga Valley State Park (20 minute uber from downtown Cleveland) or Indiana Dunes National Park (accessible via commuter rail).

Out west its going to be much more difficult, and if tour buses are available, you have to remember you're operating on their schedule, not yours. If the last bus leaves at 5pm, but there's 4 more hours of daylight, that's just how its going to work.

I really think it would be worth getting your license in the long run if your goal is to seriously see some rural, hard to reach parkland. I know the current political situation and its possible impact on the parks isn't great, but the parks are a big part of the US and while damage can be done in 4 years, much of it will survive.

mngrcwd,1k0suxi,reddit,"Amtrak is absurdly expensive, the US does not have any means of efficient public transportation at all.

Forget about smaller cities unless someone will pick you up driving. In your place I would buy a round trip to LAX or SFO (whatever is cheaper), and from there you can find extremely cheap low budget airlines (Frontier or Spirit) flights between LA and the Bay area (either to SFO or to OAK), and also to Las Vegas (and I think that's pretty much it in terms of cities where you can do stuff without a car) - for example, if you have a very lucky timing you can find tickets as cheap as $50 round trip between the bay area as las vegas, and maybe $70 between LA and SFO.

Seattle and Portland are somewhat manageable without a car as well but it will be a more expensive flight (the very cheapest I ever could find was \~$150 round trip).

Any time I've looked at Amtrak I found it to be more expensive than flying and their destinations are limited. Busses can be slow and kinda gritty. Unfortunately, the rail and bus transportation hubs in American cities are often in a crummy part of town. So, problematic for you.

What you might do without a car is pick one city and fly there. (San Diego, San Francisco, Portland, Seattle) You don't talk about accommodations and that can get expensive. But assuming you get over that hurdle, you could day trip out of that city by bus after you get to know your way around. Are you a social person?

mngs3ry,1k0suxi,reddit,"I did this! I am from NYC and, although I can drive, I’m not comfortable with it. Last summer I took Amtrak from Albuquerque back to NYC. I stopped to explore and spend the night in Topeka, St Louis, and Chicago. 

My original plan was to fly to New Mexico and road trip with my friend who drives, but our flight was canceled last minute. We ended up renting a car and driving cross country - I only drove at night when there were few cars on the road. It was a good experience and I got to see a few road stops, but honestly riding Amtrak was way more relaxing and enjoyable for me. I got to see a few cities (where I was able to explore via pubic transit, lots of walking, and uber) and get a glimpse at the small towns that exist in the wide open spaces of this country. I met interesting people in the dining car too. 

I love Amtrak, and definitely recommend booking early for the best prices. I originally booked the cheapest seat for my overnight trip from ABQ to Topeka, but I bid on an upgrade last minute and got a roommette for a good price. The meals were included and being able to lay down and sleep was awesome.",2025-04-16 19:56:44,6,SnappleSpice,travel
mngs6gr,1k0suxi,reddit,"If you can only afford one RT plane ticket, you may not have the funds you need for such an expansive trip. That said, I didn’t have a license until my mid-30s, and it is very possible to travel using public transportation. Yes, it’s slower—but you don’t have to worry about parking, and in many ways it adds to the adventure. If you have your own vehicle and just go look at sites, you’re not really experiencing a place like you can by actually interacting with people. For the most part, public transit to smaller PNW towns is limited and typically doesn’t run all hours. It’s quite safe.

Are you planning to stay with your friends? If so, they may be able to pick you up at train or bus stations in larger cities and take you back to their towns.

What are the sites you want to see? There are buses from Fresno, CA and the Bay Area to get to Yosemite, for example. In a way, it’s easier because you don’t need to get a permit like you would need to get into the park with a car and you won’t have to worry about parking in the crowded valley. Rainier and Olympic National Park do not have great transit access. The Columbia Gorge does, and it’s easy to get to the Oregon Coast and the Columbia Gorge from Portland via bus.

I’d suggest maybe being realistic about your budget and based on the amount of hotel nights and travel costs, consider limiting the scope of your trip to either Seattle/Portland & surrounds or CA & surrounds. You can also save money by flying to Seattle and home from LA, for example. The west coast is expensive especially for tourism in the high season, so take that into account.

mnh8cda,1k0suxi,reddit,"As someone living in NYC who doesn't have a license but travels everywhere for work, here's a possible scenario - just thinking about the trains here, and not how it connects to where your friends are:

Get an Amtrak Railpass - they do go on sale at certain times of the year and are an excellent deal. You won't be in a sleeping car, but many of the segments are short (or at least tolerable). Then do the following route:

Fly to Chicago - one of the best cities outside of NYC (and easy public transit). Excellent museums, great food, and the lakefront is beautiful.

Amtrak's California Zephyr to Denver. Spend a few days there - there are tours/ways to get to Rocky Mountain National Park. Also, do a day trip or stay overnight in Boulder, CO.

Back on the California Zephyr for a day trip through the Rocky Mountains - definitely the most scenic train trip in the U.S., and it rates even globally. Stop in Glenwood Springs for the amazing hot springs pools. Rent a bike to see Glenwood Canyon from outside the train window. It's also easy to get a bus to Aspen, CO - insufferably rich but still a cool place with great food and views. Take the cable car up the mountain, and/or the free bus to Maroon Bells.

Back on the same train and evening arrival in Salt Lake City. Stay there maybe one night, see the sights.

Back on the same train overnight and the next day through Donner Pass and the beautiful  Sierra Nevada mountains. Maybe stopover in Reno, NV, if it's of interest to you. The train ends in Oakland with a bus connection to San Francisco - which is obviously worth a couple of days' visit. While there, also take the ferry across the Bay to Sausalito, which is a really cool place. There are daily bus trips from there (or SF) to Muir Woods National Monument, where you can walk among the redwoods - utterly breathtaking. There are also one day tours to Yosemite National Park, though I would recommend staying overnight if you can.

Coast Starlight train to Los Angeles (or first up to Oregon and Washington to see your friends). The trip is beautiful, and you could stopover in San Luis Obispo if you wanted.

LA is what it is. Downtown is not much, and the city is hard to get around (though public transit is improving. If you're spending a few days there, I would probably go to Santa Monica for the beach. You could also get yourself via subway/car service to the ferry from Long Beach out to Santa Catalina Island, which is amazing (about 88% of the island is preserved and not open to development). I'm not sure if there are inexpensive places to stay on the island, but it is definitely memorable.

For the way back, take Amtrak's Southwest Chief to Albuquerque (overnight but an easy trip). Not so much to see there except for Sandia Mountain, but there's a regional train (the Rail Runner Express) that will take you to Santa Fe, which is definitely worth a couple of days' stay - good food, music, and ambience (and possibly do a day trip to Taos via bus).

Then back on the train at Albuquerque and overnight to Kansas City or straight through to Chicago, and fly home to NYC. If you still had segments on the rail pass, you could take Amtrak's Cardinal to DC, one of the more scenic trips in the East.

All in all, you'll miss many of the major national parks, but get to a few of the remarkable ones and you will definitely see some truly beautiful parts of the country.

Some will be doable without a car, but most of the USA, especially the natural wonders type sites like national parks and such are going to need either a car or for you to be part of a tour that provides the transportation. Things out west are far apart, the west is huge, and public transit is very limited compared to London.

Take a look at the Amtrak map to see if the train goes where you want to go.

I overstayed 2 days on a month visa (during covid time, so there was only 1 month visa available). Since my plan was to stay for 3 months I had to do a visa run once a month, which means I had to exit vietnam at a land border (cheapest way) and reenter for a new month in vietnam. 
 
Drove for 8 hours to Laos border, got denied exit due to overstay. Got directed to contact nearest police station which was 3 hours drive back. It was a Friday and when I got to the city the station was closed. Talked to some guy that talked to some other guy etcetc. After an hour or so I finally got the whatsapp of a police officer who spoke english. Told me to not leave the province and to come back to the police station to pay a fine (more symbolic than anything: about 500k dong). Found an airbnb because ofc the police stations immigration stuff is closed during the weekend, stayed and explored the small rural city over the weekend  
 
Monday I go to the police station. Took me a few hours of talking to police, making a statement and promising to not do it again. They sent me to a bank that handles fines, paid the fine, got documentation and back to the police i went. They stamped my passport for +7 days to exit the country. Drove to Laos the same day. Exited and reenter vietnam in like an hour. Drove back to my gf.

About 5-6 rather slow and painfully boring days due to really bad timing, but I learned my lesson. Dont overstay. I can only imagine 22 days got you in slightly more problems with a bogger fine and way more paperwork.
 
As for advice, I dont have any. 90% of the time ppl spoke vietnamese around me and I just did whatever I was directed to do.
Good luck!",2025-04-10 00:25:51,15,Kognit0,travel

\-Drinking Ghirardelli's hot chocolate with my sister in San Francisco and walking through many gorgeous gardens. Riding trolleys. Visiting Alcatraz (highly recommend).

If the first place he saw in the US was Florida, is he really going to put off New York until he has seen Papa New Guinea? If you felt you saw everything, that's fine, but it's not always the case.

Vienna was my dream city to visit. Still is. I packed soooo much into my two weeks there. I did every single thing that I wanted to do. Walking around the city felt like a fairytale. It looked exactly like how I thought it would. I was amazed multiple times a day. While there I found so much more to do.  Since I was there during winter most of the gardens were dormant and I couldn’t help but wonder how they would look in full bloom. So for this year’s trip I am going to Vienna again in June. Staying in the same place too. I will repeat a few things (such as a visit to the schonbrunn) but will also do several new things such as day trips to Slovakia and Hungary. Many people have told me I’m crazy and should just go somewhere else. But guess what? It’s my money paying for it, my time off work, and my life. I put off going to Vienna for years because others didn’t want to go. I regret that. Do what you want to do.

Part of what motivated that effort was that my family has learned a few languages that have been practically useless because they're either not widely spoken or the people in those countries speak great English.

I went through 2 levels of an online class to begin. Then I started trying to use some words every time I went to a Mexican restaurant. Then I met a couple brothers from Mexico who became lifelong friends. The classes I studied were conversational Spanish only, so not fluent. But I can carry on a short, general greetings conversation now. I can order food in the Mexican restaurant in their language. 

My wife & I have been across half of Chiapas, Mexico, and then Guatemala by bus with my terrible Spanish. We have made so many friends and acquaintances over the years just by trying to speak with them. And we almost always gets exceptional service because we make the effort. 

Last week we went back to Canada, through Ontario, Quebec, and into the corner of New Brunswick. There was a LOT of French there, almost exclusively in Quebec (although we could always find someone who spoke English to serve us.) Seeing the root of the word in French, and being able to figure out what it was because it had the same root word in Spanish- or a similar variation- helped us to figure out a few French words along the way.

- Learning to speak ""menu"" is the most useful type of language learning.  I am NOT fluent in Spanish, but I know enough to be able to read and communicate based off the menu.  It also is a great way to *start* learning a language as eating happens most often in your day.  On the same tip, become familiar with chatter around money.  ""How much is this?"" etc.

- Google Maps and Google Translate are *VERY* useful.  I've had full conversations with people using Translate in Japan.  

- When in doubt, look to the younger people.  Most of the time they speak fluent English because they have been using it to communicate with the rest of the world via apps like Reddit.  Even when you try to speak in their language, these types of folks will switch over to English anyway to save you the embarrassment (and them time).  

- If you're going to a large homogenous city like Tokyo or Hong Kong, you'll see a LOT of English signs, digital menus that have multiple languages, and places that have English speaking staff.  It's the smaller shops or in the country where you'll see less of that.

Also, you'd be surprised how much time and effort it takes to get to the intermediate level, so it may be worth lessening your expectations a bit.

There is a difference if you try to speak some Sinhala on Sri Lanka or Swedish in Sweden. When late respond with appreciative ""great dude, but please, don't bother and speak English"", the first can get deeply touched by the respect that you show them by speaking basics phrases and words from their language.

Also in France and Italy, it is almost mandatory to learn basics, if you want to move around independently.

A practical tip: learn basic grammar and words before your travel, than learn the useful words when they come useful to you, the translation apps are just a click away. Learn foundation before travel, than build your knowledge from the real experiences.",2025-04-19 09:22:45,1,koxxlc,travel

On the other hand, you learn a language so you can communicate with someone who doesn't speak your language.

Learning a language well can only be successful if you are really dedicated, and ideally really interested in this endeavor. You sound a little unsure in your post... maybe just start learning starting with the basics, and see how you feel and where it takes you? 

  
""I worry that I would choose destinations where I can speak the language and limit myself....""  Hmmm, personally I would worry more about 1) I spent hours trying to learn this language and I'm still terrible at it and can't understand native speakers or communicate very well. 2) I spent all this effort learning a language and when I open my mouth and speak 3 words they reply to me in perfect English.

So no, I don't let lack of English being spoken deter me from travels. I do recognize that may cut me off from certain activities, but the world is big and I'm only one person. There's plenty of things to do.

moiii8s,1k5iqnc,reddit,"Pick a country.  My daughter was in Zambia with the Peace Corps, so went to Zambia.  There was a National park where she lived so went on Safari there.  To find the right Safari pulled up google map looked at the lodging and booked one that had a local special. Think it was three nights two morning and two evening safaris. All food included, prices can be highly variable depending on luxury, and the park. The place was nice and medium or less priced.  She then heard about a canoe safari, found the lodge and booked directly with them.  That was interesting.  As those places didn’t have rhinoceros, we did a half day walking safari in the park with the rhinos.  We’re going to white water raft the Zambezi but water was too high so did a half day boat tour in Botswana.  All were interesting and a little different habitat.  Another interesting thing is we rode a train from Northern Zambia to Dar es Salaam and visited Zanzibar.  Zambia requires the guides to be educated and pass a test, the local guides were all very good.  

Safaris operate during the dry season as wildlife congregate around water holes, we went end of May to First of July which was the beginning of the dry season in Zambia, so prices were a little cheaper as August September were the peak months.  The dry season is different depending on the country.

This was our itinerary:

* Flight to Joburg on KLM (layover in Amsterdam)

* Arrive a night, immediately pick up rental vehicle and drive to hotel (Europrime Hotel) to sleep

* Depart the next morning and drive to God's Window.  Do some sightseeing and arrive at Thulamela B&B (highly recommend)

* Spend the following day at the Elephant Whispers sanctuary in one of their full day programs (note: they do elephants rides, which I know folks are mixed about, so follow your morals here)

* Back to Thulamela for the night

* Drive into Kruger and have a self-driven safari

* Stay at Olifants in Kruger

* Participate in a guided river walk (booked through sanparks)

* More self-drive safari

* Stay at Orpen in Kruger

* More self-drive safari

* Attend Bush Braai (booked through sanparks)

* Stay at Skukuza in Kruger

* More self-drive safari

* Stay at Pretoriuskop in Kruger

* Participate in morning walk (booked through sanparks)

* Self-drive safari

* Join sunset drive (booked through sanparks)

* Stay at Pretoriuskop in Kruger

* Drive back to Joburg airport, drop off rental, leave on flight home (flight was a red eye)

Total cost, not including food and souvenirs was about $5k at the time, so you've got lots of room to spend more time and do fancier stuff.

EDIT: Just noticed you said you're first time international travelers.

There are a LOT of tour companies and anyone is willing to charge you mzingu pricing. We loved Daylight Adventures tour bookings for a bit of luxury without breaking the bank. When doing Amboseli, I recommend touring a Maasai village. Beware that you will be “scammed” by everyone and anyone with a sob story because well, there is a lot of poverty and a lot of hardship. Be open to negotiating and having empathy for people trying to feed themselves. 

That being said, Botswana is my favorite country in Africa for most diverse wildlife, safety and not feeling like you’re in the cattle churner of over tourism.

My personal favourite for Kenya was Masaai Mara. If you have that much money to splurge on a trip then stay in the luxury tented camps and get the full experience. Maybe combine with Amboseli if you want a second park. Then you get the classics Kilomanjaro view.

I say this is good for first timers because you don't have to move around a lot from lodge to lodge, which can get tiring and expensive. You will also see basically every animal because the park is not enormous. If you enjoy this experience, then you can always book something a bit more intense next time. From Johannesburg you can easily spend time in Cape Town, or head to neighboring islands like Mauritius or Reunion. Another option would be to head north to Victoria Falls and maybe do a safari on the Chobe River for a few days. That would also pair nicely with Pilanesberg. I can recommend you a travel agent on the ground in Johannesburg that books custom tours if you'd like, but if you are doing Pilanesberg alone, it's not necessary.

mls8w31,1jt28g6,reddit,"For what it's worth, here's my fantasy 'Grand Tour':

* Laetoli and the Olduvai Gorge (Tanzania).  The Hominina footprints at Laetoli and hominid fossils in the gorge give incredible glimpses into early human evolution.
* Uruq in Southern Mesopotamia - arguably the first city in the world (maybe 5,000 B.C.). Centre of vast trading networks, sophisticated craftsmanship, and, not least, where the Bronze Age and agriculture probably started. It also has the earliest examples of writing and records the first known named individual.
* Egypt, Greece and Italy - naturally! Focus on architecture, medicine and mathematics and philosophers.
* Jerusalem and Mecca - the places where Christianity and Islam started. Arguably, a visit to the Indus River Valley would also be in order.
* Ulugh Beg's observatory in Samarkand, Uzbekistan - started in the 1420s but much more than just a site for astronomical observations (notably Beg determined the length of the sidereal year and was only out by 58 seconds). Essentially, it was a university and scholars - both men and women - travelled across continents to study there.
* Timbuktu manuscripts in Bamako (Mali). They range from the late 13th Century and, while many remain to be deciphered,  cover art, medicine, philosophy, and science
* St. Mark's Basilica Venice (Italy) - for a performance of music by Monteverdi or one of the Gabriellis. Polyphonic sound at its finest!
* Mainz, Germany - to see where Gutenberg developed moveable type printing (and for its under-rated wine!).
* Trinity College , Cambridge - plenty of contributions to human advancement (e.g. 34 Nobel laureates) but the focus would be on Isaac Newton and 'Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica'. 
* Paris - with a focus on its 18th-century salons and the French Revolution / the rise of egalitarianism
* St. Petersburg University (Russia) - to see where Dmitri Mendeleev came up with the periodic table of the elements.
* Down House (England) - where Charles Darwin came up with the concepts associated with evolution.
* The classical gardens of Suzhou (China). Suzhou was the largest non-capital city in the world for much of the 19th century and had immense cultural influence. Its many gardens are exquisite - as are its waterways. Also a major site of the Taiping Rebellion, which killed \~20-30 million people.
* The Ironbridge Gorge (England) - the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution.
* The Killing Fields of Cambodia - because it seems we constantly need to be reminded of genocide.
* Stanford University and Silicon Valley (US) - the place where both genetic engineering and various computer tech innovations originated.

I would argue that the journey is more important than the destinations as even the most pampered trip was going to be more arduous and challenging than simply sitting in one’s estate.

Probably many of the same destinations still apply…Paris, Rome, Venice, etc in Europe with the addition of destinations in Africa, Asia and South America. 

I mean you might as well start in London, follow the classic itinerary south through France to Italy and then maybe go east through Greece and Turkey.  That covers much western civilization history from Greek, Rome, Byzantine, Venice, etc to present day.

From Istanbul fly to Africa, Asia, the Americas and back to wherever you come from…

mlug3zn,1jt28g6,reddit,"I don't think there's a good answer to this. But I do think it's a good thought exercise.

First, the meaning of ""cultured"" at the time of the old Grand Tour is probably not what most of us might have in mind today. Since it was people from Europe traveling almost exclusively through Europe, it was a necessarily narrow view of culture.

Second, I think the goal is nebulous. What does it mean to be cultured or well-rounded in today's society? More to the point, in which society in today's world?

So this necessarily depends on the person, but it's something for each person to think about. The best I think I could say generally is for someone to seek out destinations and cultures that are different from their own. To step out of one's comfort zone and embrace the unknown. Rick Steve's once wrote:

>Culture shock is a constructive thing. It’s the growing pains of a broadening perspective. To me, there are two kinds of travel: There’s escape travel, and there’s reality travel. I want to go home a little bit different, a little less afraid, a little more thankful, a little better citizen of the planet.

In the world, there are very few areas of firm land that are antipodal to other firm land and not the ocean, so there are very few pairs of major cities that are even close to be antipodal to each other. Two of these pairs are Madrid and Wellington, and Singapore and Quito. What's special about those two is that you can draw a (kinda sorta) straight line that not only links all four cities, but also passes right thru or very close by:

* **Madrid**
* Barcelona
* Rome
* Istambul
* Tehran
* Hyderabad
* Nagpur
* Kuala Lumpur
* **Singapore**
* Bali
* Sydney
* **Wellington**
* **Quito**
* Bogotá
* Caracas
* Martinique
* Azores
* Lisbon
* And back to **Madrid**

You could pick and choose, maybe skip some, maybe add others, but that sounds like a nice enough collection of cities. If you also take a small detour to visit, say, Algiers or Cairo, not only you'd be travelling the entire circumference of the Earth, you'd also be visiting cities in Europe, Africa, Asia (including the Indian subcontinent), Australia and NZ, and the Americas. Couldn't really fit a visit to, like, Miami, on that line to get the North America check, but if you subscribe to a 6-continent model of the world, that's pretty neat. In any case, if you wanna fly from Wellington to Quito, there's a good chance you'd have to go thru SFO, LAX of DFW, so that might work too.",2025-03-31 17:41:29,3,ZAWS20XX,travel

For hiking in general, San Diego would be really nice. You can either uber or take public transit (at least most of the way) to Torrey Pines state park which are really cool coastal bluffs. La Jolla cove is pretty near there too where there are seal and sea lion colonies. There’s also Point Loma/cabrillo national monument which is similar.

You probably could bike to all those places too.

In a similar vein, San Francisco would be a great option. Great city well worth visiting in its own right, and tons of cyclists cross the Golden Gate Bridge to bike in the Marin Headlands north of the city

If you go visit NYC and really want to hike, you can take Metro North commuter rail to an area called Breackneck Ridge which is a popular and pretty hike. Perhaps one of the few transit accessible hikes in the U.S. The town of Cold Spring Harbor right next to it is cute and you could hike breackneck to cold spring via bull hill (there’s another train stop in cold spring)

It was such a mess. We lost the tickets we had for a show in Vegas and after 2 hours of the agent doing everything could, we gave up and spent $1000 on tickets to get the rest of the way home. After all of that, it took 2 months to get reimbursed.

I'm a man a bit younger than you and have been facing some of the same struggles as what you've described in your post - mainly the everlasting search for myself and daydreaming about taking an extended period of time to focus on creative pursuits. 

I'll be blunt: You aren't going to find yourself sitting in a cafe. You will find yourself by interacting with the world around you, and by doing things that you find challenging. That doesn't mean you have to run a marathon, but you need to get out of your comfort zone in some sort of way. Hanging out in a cafe is not a way to get out of your comfort zone, based on what you've described. Climb a mountain. Go surfing. Karaoke with strangers. Have an adventure that is so outside of your usual day-to-day that the people around you look at you with envy. The outdoors is the best place for your soul. It is scientifically proven. 

You also don't need to take a vacation to start writing. I feel like you are romanticizing the work of a writer by daydreaming about writing something in a café somewhere cool.

Another very cool spot was Happy Lemon Tree Lodge. It's at the boundary to a nature reserve. So you have a river with crocs, rhinos elephants etc. you can just sit and stare, go on safari, the town is nice and the people are friendly.

You should definitely consult a doctor for your heart condition (you'll be required to have a doctor's permission to dive) but generally scuba diving doesn't require much if any fitness level and it is not an athletic activity. So people with heart problems are not necessarily excluded, it depends on their specific condition.

Every time I get into the water, I get out happy, relaxed and with a clear mind. I can't recommend it enough against feeling down.

Amed is a nice easy going place with just enough people to not feel isolated. If you get bored, the island is well connected by air to many interesting places in the area (have not been to Yogyakarta yet but seems like it may fit your interests)",2025-04-09 20:55:32,2,jaoldb,travel

Tulemar Resort in Manuel Antonio. Its on 40 acres of private jungle. With it's own beach that has table/hammock service. I usually rent a Casa that has an outdoor dining balcony with a BBQ. Most morning we had families of capuchin monkeys pop by. And often on the beach a Sloth would be above me in a tree.

Arenal, Springs resort. Also on acres of private jungle. Situated looking onto Arenal Volcano. It has multiple hot spring pools, it often feels your the only one there. They have trips you can schedule to zip lines, waterfalls and river tours.

London is loaded with educated, cultured people; has a wonderful train system; and has beautiful architecture (the city feels like a giant collection of interconnected neighborhoods).  I would move to London tomorrow if I could.

Madrid in Spain is also a terrific city.  They also have a wonderful train system that takes you all over the city and the country.  Like London, Madrid is a city of neighborhoods.  I was there on a day with 90-degree temperatures and after walking around all day I never broke a sweat.  The air is dry and thus it doesn't feel hot and humid like we are used to in the U.S.

Spain has so many gorgeous cities that it's unreal.  Portugal has the impossibly beautiful cities of Porto and Lisbon, Portugal.

Bologna, Italy is gorgeous.  It's Italy's premier university city and has one of the world's oldest universities.  

Oslo, Norway is a city filled with young people.  I took a ride on their street car through town and passed one bar/ restaurant after the next buzzing with young professionals (thanks to their strong economy).  Copenhagen Denmark and Stockholm, Sweden are even more historic and gorgeous.  Ditto for adorable Helsinki.

I actually adored Poland.  Warsaw's historic center looks like France...oh so elegant and beautifully restored.  The city also has London-esque neighborhoods from the early 1900s and a modern downtown filled with glass towers.  The city is booming and is also amazingly safe.

I liked Krakow even more. The city center is elegant and is a wonderful size (not too big and not too small).  

Scotland also is hard to beat.  Both Edinburgh and Glasgow are wonderful towns, and Glasgow sits near the base of the exquisite Scottish Highlands and is also not far from the impossibly quaint and scenic Hebrides Islands.

I also visited Vilnius, Lithuania.  It's absolutely gorgeous and also is a terrific size.  The city is historic and quaint but also has a buzzing economy and lots of wealth.  The setting is lovely on the edge of some green foothills.  They have plenty of young people as evidenced by all the newly-built, modern apartment buildings  in parts of the city center.  Vilnius is a place where I could move to tomorrow if I had the option.

For something more unexpected. Romania has several fabulous cities with burgeoning tech economies, including Cluj-Napoca, Timisoara, and Brasov, among others.  These cities are some of the safest cities in the world and are located near the Carpathian Mountains of Transylvania.

An obvious advantage is that your bag is less likely to get lost, pilfered, or stolen. Or, I hate to say, you're less likely to have problems with contraband added to your bag, i.e., by officials trying to extort you.

Another advantage is that, if you have a connecting flight, you can switch flights, i.e., if there's room on an earlier connection during a layover. At least in the US, the airlines usually won't separate you from your checked bags. So if your checked bag is locked into a later connecting flight, you are too.

Yet another advantage is that if you end up stuck somewhere, you've got all your stuff, i.e., a change of cloths, your favorite stuffed toy, etc.

Edit: in the U.S., it’s usually a set mph over the speed limit that warrants a fine and that’s usually 10 mph over the limit for camera speeding tickets. The speed limit is considered a speed suggestion by many people until they see a police officer.",2025-04-25 02:10:17,2,oripeiwei,travel

South Cyprus and British Cyprus: fairly normal other than on the wrong side. Everything is marked as no parking and people park everywhere.  North Cyprus: similar but a bit more chaotic, but the stops signs say ""DUR"" which was never not funny.

Romania: more horse drawn carriages than you might expect. Made a wrong turn once quite near Bucharest and a pack of dogs attacked the rental car.

Turkey: Mostly normal except that there are a lot of dickhead drivers. Like if you're stopped at a light they will drive past everyone on the dirt shoulder and go through the red light.

Martinique, La Palma, Tenerife: I've found that my favorite kind of trip is driving around on a tropical volcano, and I should go do this more often. In Martinique they have highways that just crash straight into roundabouts, so you're going fast and slow a lot. In La Palma the road sign and barrier design aesthetic reminded me of state or national parks in the US, which fits with the views.

Panama: got pulled over for speeding and got shaken down for a bribe. Still have no idea how much I was actually supposed to pay.

Barbados: another wrong side country, but otherwise relatively non-notable driving. 

Crete: a big part of the main highway is two lane, but the shoulders are paved and people drive half or fully on the shoulder. For passing you just go in the middle of the road and people get out of your way. Driving some smaller roads in January down to the south coast it seemed like I had been the only traffic for a month.

Iceland: I paid something like $600 for a two day car rental on short notice so that I could go see the volcano. Terrible weather did not stop me from going to see the volcano.

My husband is an excellent driver and it doesn’t phase him if we’re in a country where the cars are right-hand drive or he needs to drive on the other side of the road. But the one place where he actually felt unsafe driving was Madeira. The island is full of steep, winding roads. 

There was one morning where we were trying to get up a mountain to watch the sunrise. We got to a point where it was so steep, it felt like we were at a 70 degree angle. In order to make it up such a steep angle, you obviously need to give it a lot of gas continuously. However, because you literally cannot see around the bend and it’s just one narrow lane, he didn’t give it enough speed while trying to be cautious and we started rolling backwards down the mountain. He started to get panicky and had no idea how we were supposed to get up the mountain safely. 

A minute later, an older Portuguese man popped up out of nowhere, told my husband to move and he would drive us up the mountain. So we let him. It was the scariest car ride of my life. Greg roared up the mountain at full speed, taking sharp twists and turns with confidence and honking the horn relentlessly the whole way up to alert any incoming cars. By the time he got us to a point where we should be fine to continue on our own, we were sweaty and shaky because we were wracked with such anxiety the entire time. But Greg got us up the mountain and we survived! We gave him €10 and he went on his way down the mountain.

I have actively skipped driving in countries where they drive on the wrong side of the road.

Most harrowing was probably some combination of Brazil (highway lanes are a suggestion at best), Mexico (hello topes; and lanes are also a suggestion here), and DR (why yes let's play leapfrog with cars, making a road 1 lane in each direction turn into a road somehow 2-3 lanes in each direction; also speed ditches).

Portugal was stressful because it was maybe my third time driving manual and the entire country is covered in roundabouts, which is one extra thing to have to navigate on top of not stalling.

I had a moment in CR where I laughed because the speed limit of this not-really-a-road-so-much-as-a-gap-in-the-jungle was something like 70 kph but short of having god's own suspension there was no way you were going to survive 70kph without your brain rattling clean out of your head.",2025-04-24 17:27:38,1,angelicism,travel

Germany, where I twice lived for half a year. From there, short trips to the Netherlands and Belgium. Very easy, but especially in Germany there are so many rules that it becomes confusing at times. Especially challenging when you mostly want to drive at the speed limit and some douchy sports car wants to go like 20-30 km/h over and tailgate the shit out of you.

Spain, where I lived for a year in college. Only highways on the east coast and a bit inside Barcelona. This was some 20 years ago, but I remember that it was pretty relaxed.

USA: West coast, Seattle to San Francisco with a few stops in between. Extremely easy.

Not aware of speed cameras being a thing in Northern Italy- I came home to a pile of tickets that were mailed to me. And I’m normally not a speeder- but drivers there will ride your ass until you are going well over the speed limit on winding, mountain roads. 

Japan has triangle shaped stop signs. Probably ran through the first couple of those.

mo7ywvn,1k3qkuz,reddit,"I've been to all of them except Nepal so my (skewed) perspectives:


Korea - I'm from there, return every year to visit family (heading there as we speak, though stopped over in Rotterdam atm). For me, it's just home so can't recommend too much other than the food, which, again is biased, is the best in the world. 😉 The feels around Seoul are typical big city vibes, but if you go out a bit, you'll get a quick rural feel. A bit like Japan tbh (I also go there a LOT). Good home base for Eastern Asian travel, though I recommend Busan over Seoul, as it's less crowded and has much better seafood. Probably the most like places you've been, especially if you don't venture out of the big cities. Good hikes, but nothing too wild near the cities. Very well maintained, even paved for the seniors. 


Malaysia - I visit a friend in Kuala Lumpur, have only traveled there and nearby, also on the way to Singapore, with my friends. Very humid no matter the time of year. Very cheap, great food, especially the street food. Muslim nation, which doesn't have a ton of implications other than harder to find pork based food (Chinese places). KL is quite a bit different from Singapore, but there's a decent amount of overlap of food and culture as there are a lot of Malay in Sing. Btw, my friend maintains Malaysia has the best street food in the world, including Thailand and Sing (he's ethnically Thai and incredibly well traveled). 


Thailand - I've only been to Bangkok on my own, and surrounding villages with my friend from KL. Also humid. Bangkok felt similar to KL, but I didn't explore a ton. If you get out of Bangkok, probably a lot wilder. Gorgeous temples, but wear long sleeves and pants (you can sometimes buy covers right outside). 


Taiwan - I've only been to Taipei and briefly, wandering a bit, then eating at Din Tai Fung, drinking beers with my table of strangers who became fast friends. Sorry, can't provide a ton more for this one. 😅 I've heard there's great hiking just outside Taipei though. 


Honestly, I'd vote for combining Malaysia and Thailand, as you've already need to Singapore (and don't mind the humidity). Have fun! ",2025-04-21 07:26:40,3,Ruffshots,travel

South Korea and Taiwan can be quite similar to Japan and China to travel within, but have their own unique nature sites and food to explore. Taiwan and South Korea are fab to visit in March/April, you will catch snow and maybe cherry blossoms in S Korea, lily season in Taiwan if you’re in these countries at the right time. I consider my trips here to be mainly staying in very urban/build up cities paired with lots of day trips out to historical sites and mountains. Like Japan and China, they are very convenient to travel within, with high speed rails, good public transport systems, etc which makes day tripping easy without sacrificing comfort.

Malaysia: I haven’t been but everyone that has loved it. For a 3 week trip I think it’s perfect to pair with Thailand. 

You mentioned slightly off the beaten track, I would recommend: 
- Mongolia
- Central Asia (I’m headed there soon)
- Pakistan

I've worked online since 2015 and backpacked through Southeast Asia for a couple years with my partner, if I had to choose one sole island to spend my 3 weeks in (since you work online, you probably need the stability and would rather spend more days lying on a beach than busing/flying to other places) I would say Koh Phangan.

You can get there easily enough -- get to Bangkok, fly from there to Koh Samui then catch a ferry over to Phangan (this is the fastest but also most expensive) or fly to Donsak (much cheaper than flying to Samui) then ride a bus over to the ferry port and ride the ferry to Phangan.

Phangan has an awesome blend of everything -- it has wild parties, although I would recommend the Halfmoon Festival which happens every couple of weeks more than the Full Moon party. There are also amazing beaches, stunning bites at Pantip market and all around the island really, and even opportunity to get your diving license. Plus, if you go up to the Amsterdam bar, you'll have some of the best views in your lifetime.

And, there are lots of places with good enough internet to hold video meetings and plenty of chances to rent a car or motorbikes to go around the island. Otherwise, transport can get a little pricey ;)

moevwqr,1k4s86o,reddit,"My wife and I have good friends who live in Bangkok. In early 2023 we finally made the trek to visit for about a month, to enjoy that beautiful country.

While there our friend booked the four of us for a short beach holiday in southern Thailand. Apparently Thai citizens avoid Phuket because it's expensive, noisy, dirty, and jammed with foreigners.

Instead, we flew to Krabi and stayed on Tonsai Beach at the [Tinidee Hideaway Resort](https://www.tinideekrabiresort.com/). Tonsai Beach is surrounded by mountains with sheer cliff faces. There are no roads in or out. Access is via motorboat from Noppharat Thara Beach a couple miles up the coast. There isn't even a dock... you land on Tonsai Beach like MacArthur coming ashore in the Philippines.

The Tinidee resort is simple and secluded... there are no nightclubs, no spas, no shopping. We had our own private bungalow on stilts right on the beach, and I think it cost maybe $110/night? The resort is impeccably clean, and has a single restaurant that puts out incredible food.

This place was absolute heaven. No crowds. No traffic. No concrete buildings. No cell service (there was WiFi).  Nothing but pure peace and serenity. We spent 3 nights and man I'll tell you, I'd go back in a heartbeat.

The entire beach holiday, including 2 RT Bangkok-Krabi airline tickets, vans and water taxis, 3 nights at the resort, all our meals & drinks, plus a full-day private charter boat excursion (the four of us explored the deserted tropical islands in the bay) cost a grand total of \~$1,400 all-in for me and my wife.",2025-04-22 11:26:37,1,Straight-Part-5898,travel

Pro tip, if you do plan on going to the Philippines - fly into Cebu City and base your travel out of there. It's centrally located so it's reasonably cheap to access all parts of the country from there via ferries or cheap flights.

The food in the Philippines is under rated too. But I think that's because most major cities are taken over by western influence. But you can still find excellent native Filipino dishes if you look hard enough.

mnrf8t9,1k24xal,reddit,"It's worth noting that, while Kyushu is underrated with Western tourists, it's popular with Korean and Chinese tourists. So even when one thinks they're going to ""secret"" places in Kyushu because of the lack of mention on the English internet, they may be sites well-trodden for tourists of other countries. 

I visited Kyushu for a month in November, I think it was 2018. From personal experience, of the places I visited, here's how I'd define them:

- **Crowded sites in Kyushu**: Dazaifu, Kitakyushu (crowded around Mojiko, but the centre with the castle and toilet museum was okay), Yufuin (total tourist town, has become a bit kitsch), Nagasaki (tourists, but also many school groups), Beppu, Takachiho (mostly the gorge, the surrounding area is okay), Aoshima (also beach areas were quite dirty)

That said, while I would eagerly encourage you to skip both Dazaifu and Yufuin, I found Nagasaki very interesting despite the crowds due to its unique history, and Takachiho was very beautiful (I walked from the gorge to Amano Iwato Shrine, which turned out to be quite far, but nice scenery of rice fields and quiet restaurants). I haven't been to Aso area so can't comment.

- **Popular places but not overly crowded**: Mt.Unzen, Yūtoku Inari Shrine, Yanagawa, Kumamoto, Kagoshima, Sakurajima, Kirishima Mountains

I loved all those places. For Sakurajima, crowds can be avoided by taking one of the first ferries to the island; I was alone most of the morning walking the lava trail and around town, but doing the loop bus to the volcano viewpoint was quite crowded. Worth it though. Yanagawa is very popular, esp.with Japanese tourists, but people are confined to boats so walking around is very easy and it doesn't feel like there are many people. In the mountains, Kirishima shrine itself was popular, beyond that some trails like Mt. Takachiho-no-mine had some Japanese tourists, so I've put it in ""popular places"", but it was easy to find time alone going for a walk and most hot springs are empty. If you're there for a few days, it will feel very quiet. I slept in Maruo Onsen.

- **Had a couple Japanese tourists / I was alone**: Takeo Onsen, Yoshinogari site, Shimabara, Arita pottery town, Saga city, Chiran, Hyuga National Park, Miyazaki city (it's a city so there's people, but I saw no other tourists beyond the station, everyone seemed to be on buses going elsewhere and sites in the city were empty), Udo jingu

There are always festivals, but what month/dates are you visiting? ""Autumn"" can mean September-December...

**Edit**: Here are some [pics](https://imgur.com/a/NJmtN3U) of the above-mentioned places, so you can see what November looks like in Kyushu, also some festivals.",2025-04-18 14:09:17,30,NotACaterpillar,travel

mnsbyut,1k24xal,reddit,"I live in Tokushima on Shikoku. It's beautiful in autumn. [Iya Valley in particular is quite stunning](https://i.imgur.com/pjqSgNg.jpeg). There are also some beautiful temples that are great in the fall. Last fall, I visited Hashikuraji and Tairuiji. I can highly recommend those, but there are plenty more all over. Timing of the autumn leaves will depend on the particular area you visit, but you should look up the historical timing, because they are beautiful. There are several tracking websites for this. [Walkerplus](https://koyo.walkerplus.com/) is one that I've used in the past.

There is a lot of culture and history in Shikoku. There are several historical castles, for example. Kochi Castle and Matsuyama Castle are the big names, but Imabari Castle, Ozu Castle, and others are also very cool. You might also like some of the old merchant towns. Uchiko and Ozu in Ehime, and Wakimachi in Tokushima are very interesting.

It's not exactly the most authentic, because it's a curated outdoor museum, but Shikoku Mura in Kawaga is still a very cool and informative site to learn about the cultural history of this island. And if you go to Takamatsu, you have to visit Ritsurin, one of the most beautiful gardens in Japan.

Note that travel in Shikoku is pretty difficult without a car. So I highly recommend renting one. But it's worth it.

If the Sengoku period is a big motivation for your trip, you might consider something back on the main island (if you haven't already been there): Sekigahara. It's a city in southwest Gifu Prefecture, and it's the site of arguably the most important battle in Japanese feudal history. There's a battlefield museum and some other interesting sites. I haven't actually been there myself, but as I'm also interested in this kind of history, I've been looking into going there sometime soon.",2025-04-18 16:54:22,5,cbunn81,travel
mnva1tx,1k24xal,reddit,"I lived in Kumamoto and traveled around at the time and returned years later to revisit a few favorite places and attend one of the prefecture’s biggest festivals. Kyūshū is lovely especially in autumn when the mountains are a blaze with red, orange and yellow. One of my core memories from Kumamoto was hiking up to the local shrine in autumn and how beautiful it was. Note, because it’s less traveled by western tourists parts of Kyūshū requires a bit of Japanese (or a lot of hand gestures, translation apps and patience) to get around. 

Fukuoka has enough to do for a couple of days - great ramen, a few notable shrines and temples, pleasant to walk around. I enjoyed just meandering along the river and along side streets. I visited Dazaifu Tenmangū, for a half day or so. 

Kumamoto City is smaller but still offers a few points of interest worth a couple of days - a castle which parts are original although other parts of have been reconstructed due to time and earthquakes; Suizenji Park is lovely and will be gorgeous at that time of year, there are also a few interesting shrines, the biggest of which, Fujisaki Hachimangu, will host its annual matsuri in September. 

Outside of Kumamoto City you can visit Aso, an active volcano, if it isn’t closed due to toxic gases. The city of Aso is relatively small and easy to explore, it’s perfect for a day trip from Kumamoto City but you can stay overnight in a ryokan if you want the experience. The city boasts one of the oldest shrines in Japan and is worth a visit. You can experience natural onsen there (or in any of the nearby local towns like Kikuchi and Yamaga). Kikuchi Keikoku (gorge) is a beautiful natural gorge set in the mountains of Kikichi gun. It’s a nice place to walk/hike and you enjoy a lunch box along the gorge. The scenery is stunning when the foliage has changed colors.  

Amakusa consists of a series of islands which are part of Kumamoto and was a favorite day trip from the city. The islands are a little tropical getaway in Kumamoto with crystal clear blue water and cute little shops including a number of pottery studios throughout it. 

While in Kumamoto you can check out the local delicacies which includes tonkotsu ramen (similar but still different from Hakata ramen), basashi (saw horsemeat), karashi renkon, etc

Sakurajima is down in Kagoshima and is another active volcano on the island. I don’t remember much else from my trip to Kagoshima other than Sakurajima and that it was a fun (but longer than expected) drive down from Kumamoto.",2025-04-19 02:54:50,6,shikawgo,travel

This was one of the most memorable travel experiences of my life with lots of opportunities to connect with locals. We stayed in a cycling lodge one night and then rented a beach house from AirBnb for night two — it was surprisingly affordable and filled with ways to relax, including a jacuzzi tub, a sauna, and access to a rocky beach. We took a train to Matsuyama and stayed one night before renting a car and heading into the mountains of Shikoku. The drive took us through intimidating twisty roads that would narrow to one lane; and through miles-long tunnels. The drive alone was worth it to me. We stopped in quaint villages to eat and explore. We stayed two nights at an older couple's rural cabin perched on a gorgeous river valley. They cooked for us multiple times even though we only ordered one meal. They were super sweet and we enjoyed chatting with them through their outdated translator device.

If you do go to Türkiye, you can take the bus to other interesting places like Pamukkale, Efes, and Kapadokya. The busses are overnight and not the best for sleeping, but they're safe and convenient.

mkntx9e,1jnuih5,reddit,"I’ve visited Budapest and currently live in Istanbul, so I can't speak to Prague. Instead of telling you which city to choose, I’d like to share some of my personal thoughts about both cities.

Budapest is a charming city with many beautiful buildings and historical sights. I really enjoyed my trip there and would love to go back in the next few years. However, since you mentioned that you're not into the drinking and party scene, it might feel a bit lonely at night. I should point out that we rented a house in a pub area without realizing it, which shaped my experience of the city. Since we visited in the off-season, the nightlife outside of pubs and clubs may be quite different in the summer when more activities are available.

Istanbul, on the other hand, offers a bunch of historical places and sights. Although I might be biased, I believe it’s a unique city in the world. It feels like multiple cities within one, as the old town differs greatly from the more local areas. Each neighborhood has its own vibe; one may feel more Middle Eastern while another could have a Western atmosphere. Istanbul is lively both day and night, and the nightlife extends beyond just drinking. However, it is also much more crowded than Budapest, and like any major metropolis, it can be less safe. You may find yourself rushing around more, which can lead to added stress.

If you decide to visit Istanbul, I highly recommend staying on the Asian side. It’s generally a calmer area, also general vibe for young people are better making it better suited for young travelers. Plus, public transport is efficient, so you shouldn't have any issues getting around.",2025-03-31 10:10:51,2,latespresso,travel

We did vienna 2 days, budapest 2 days and prague 2 days. I wanted to do Bratislava too, but didn't have time (which should've only been 1 day). We were doing more highlights with intention of going back to favorite spots later on. I didn't like prague at all, people were rude, didn't feel like there was much. Saw the architecture in the 2 days, and that was enough, don't plan to go back. Budapest I loved, was beautiful city and had a lot to see on both sides of the river. Went to the baths as well and their community centers around there were interesting. Would definitely go back. And vienna has a ton! Would be a couple weeks alone to get thru the museums. We just stuck to the palace and went to a concert and the zone 1 area, would definitely go back for the b3autiful architecture. 

As for Istanbul, I really enjoyed it (though I am middle eastern, so the mix between middle east and western influence was interesting to see). I felt safe as a single female walking around the mosque area late at night (safer than in US honestly). Mosques were beautiful, people were nice, food was good, markets were fun, and the city itself gorgeous. I would recommend if you pick Istanbul, you also go to other parts of turkey like cappiodocia. Also take a ferry on the water, it's gorgeous! 

I don't think there is one better than another, it's more a matter of what you're interested in trip-wise. If you're looking for western historical culture with some variation, I'd pick budapest. If you want to hear the call to prayer and more middle eastern influences, I'd pick Istanbul.

mkn3ewv,1jnuih5,reddit,"I love the Middle East and Turkey overall \*except\* for Istanbul, and I've been twice. It's a big, overcrowded, filthy city with a high risk of earthquakes. Yes, it has historically cool sites and museums (which are very expensive for foreigners), but to me it mostly felt like a bunch of mosques that Erdoğan built. Also, it's basically impossible for a tourist to get a cab there without getting ripped off, so you'll likely need to learn to use the metro. It's really hard to move around from neighborhood to neighborhood, and being in the tourist area, you'll be forced to pay insane prices at restaurants. Also, their airport is absolutely dreadful and so far from the tourist part of the city. I was there with my Iranian partner and his family in late 2023, and we all hated it. Sorry :(

Not sure if this is a factor for you, but Istanbul is also not a place to try to travel on a budget right now unless you're being hosted by locals.

In contrast, in 2021, I went on a road trip by myself from Cappadocia to Antalya, Kaş, and Selçuk, and that was absolutely incredible and one of my favorite trips. No shortage of interesting historical sites and beautiful landscapes (including the Mediterranean) in those areas.

I had a lovely time in Prague in 2023 but have not been to Budapest yet.

Btw, I see that you're young and have only traveled in Europe? Don't be afraid to go to Asia in addition to the Middle East sometime. Lots of Americans stop at ""Europe"" as the most exotic and faraway land they can imagine. While I've been on many enjoyable trips to Europe, including studying abroad there, Asia just feels so different, and it's very stimulating for your brain. I've been to Japan, Thailand, Cambodia, India, Malaysia and Bali, and they're all cheaper and more exotic than the typical European destinations. They're also safer because they barely have any sort of pickpocketing issue at all, which is very common and normal in many European and Latin American destinations and which can totally ruin your trip. It seems that in most Asian cultures, people are taught to be fair and not to steal - not so in some countries in Europe, for example in Spain, where pickpocketing, shoplifting, and theft generally are par for the course. Not to deter you from going to Spain either, but you need a real strategy and multiple backup plans in case the thieves get you.

mo5j2c5,1k3todq,reddit,"Having taken many cruises, in most cases they will bring people aboard to stamp you in and out, usually including a face-match for it, often for the entry visa, sometimes for the exit if they do it aboard ship (sometimes they do it on land as you're reboarding).

Now...there's plenty of reasons this could have happened. But I'm going to wager that they did this in bulk, without a face-to-passport matching on exit from Ecuador. That means they processed them in bulk basically, and it's entirely possible (though unlikely) that the passport wasn't stamped at all, or that the ink ran out on the stamp and they didn't notice (more likely given how faint some stamps I've gotten have been) as they were processing. Sometimes it happens. Not often, but it does.

That said, when your friend reclaimed his passport at that point (usually on the evening they are leaving the country) he should have checked himself to ensure the stamp was there. This was, indeed, not a cruise line issue. It was likely an honest mistake made by some oversight along the way by the customs folks, and I'm inclined to think that it was rather on your friend to not have checked when he collected his passport as it was returned to him.

Always check, and if it doesn't look right, let someone know then and there. The customs folks don't leave until the very last minute usually, often when the exit pilot disembarks, and they usually embark while underway with the entry pilot, so people are on board for the entirety of the stay, and for at least an hour or two before you dock and up to three hours after you leave depending on circumstances.

As the saying goes, trust but verify. It's much easier to rectify the situation in the moment than it is to try and somehow sort it out an indeterminate period of time later, and a trip to the front desk when you discover what happened, and the customs folks are probably still aboard, will often get the ball rolling.

That said, what I would recommend your friend do, is get the itinerary from that trip, and get in touch with the Ecuadorian embassy or consulate, and see if there's anything that *they* can do to help with the situation. Maybe they can, maybe they can't. But the cruise line is right in that it's now out of their hands.",2025-04-20 21:14:53,26,JDolan283,travel

mkcpw6c,1jm4eep,reddit,"We travel a lot, and over the years, these have become my favorite/must bring travel items:

* crossbody purse/bag that I have on the plane and when in cities. I feel like I don't look so much like a tourist, and like that I can pull it in front of me in busy areas

* packing cubes. I love that they compress things and keep things organized. Makes packing light very possible and easy.

* laundry sheets - I pack light (almost exclusively a carry-on only) and love when I can do some laundry during my trip, plus they don't count against my liquids. I also bring a handful of clothespins as many Europeans only hang dry laundry.

* I also use non-luquid toiletries - bar style face wash, conditioner & shaving. Powder dry shampoo. Doesn't count against liquids either. You'd have to try to see if you like them, but I do. Obviously, lots of lodging provide some of these things, but not always. 

* Foldable grocery style bag. Most grocery stores in Europe and even many stores in the US don't give bags for free. I bring 2 that fold down tiny and tuck into my purse. If we stop to buy food or snacks or some drinks for our hotel room, this is easy to pull out for easy carrying while walking or using public transport. 

* small zippable vitamins/meds container with 7 days and am/pm sides so I can pack enough for 14 days in something barely bigger than my phone. I like that it zips, so there is no risk of something popping open and spilling pills. 

* a different tiny pill container for things like otc meds - ibuprofen, pepto, cold meds, etc. Easy to grab each trip and have ""just in case"" meds without a bunch of bottles. 

* silicone rings - I don't travel with expensive jewelry, so my husband and I both wear silicone wedding bands. They stretch during flights or when it's hot and we are walking a lot and fingers swell a bit and I never worry about misplacing it

* a set of wireless earbuds and one corded set. The wireless I can attach to my phone on a flight or my husband and I each take one to listen to audio guides while traveling. Wired to connect to in-flight entertainment - not all airlines offer these for free

* international adapter - we have ones that work in almost every county plus have USB & USB-C ports. Bonus is that most cruise lines have American plugs & European plugs - by having this, I have an extra outlet to use

* portable charger - we like the ones with attached cords about the same size as a phone

* small pack of unscented baby wipes. These come in handy often and I like being able to at least wipe down my face & hands as needed on a long international flight

*compression socks - if your feet tend to swell while flying or you don't love getting up while flying, these can really help",2025-03-29 13:33:14,5,UniqueLunch2628,travel

My main gripe with them is the horrible consideration they have for customers.

Seriously though, CryinAir is a low cost carrier, so you shouldn’t expect any real quality to the service. It’s not a long flight, so it should be fine. Would not recommend paying for *any* supplemental charges whether it’s insurance or bags or anything else. Pack light, travel light, arrive at the airport early.

I have only had one experience with CryinAir and I decided it would be never again, but that’s just me, and it had more to do with the airport than the airline. If I ever see a flight going through London Stansted again I will pay 2x the fare just to avoid it. Gatwick and Heathrow are so much nicer and better managed, especially the security process. But Stansted was the only hub that ~~RyanAir~~ CryinAir flies out of in London, so. No choice.

I arrived at the airport expecting that in the year 2025 I would be able to use my app for my ticket. They never sent it so I had to go through the check-in process. Okay. Strike 1 against them.

Then the check-in line. It felt like going through Ellis Island during the Potato famine. The line was longer than an American Airlines queue at Christmas—that’s long for those who don’t know; crying babies, people who haven’t bathed in a statistically significant number of days, everyone trying to cram everything they own into the carry-on sized standard to see if they’ll be allowed on. Absolute chaos. I finally arrive to the counter and the lady asks me for my confirmation number.

My what?! Do you know how many years it has been since I needed to know my confirmation number!? I just asked if they could look it up by my last/first name and destination. Nope. A computer system for a major airline doesn’t have the capacity to do a basic index search of scheduled passengers using essential criteria. Crazy. I think that’s like a grade school level programming assignment these days.

Either way, I had to go back into my email and try to find the confirmation number. But guess what—the number they send you—that’s not your confirmation number. That’s just your itinerary number. L.O.L. Absolute ridiculousness. I don’t remember how it ever did all get sorted out. I just remember getting my ticket after 20 minutes with the check-in agent.

This was the one positive of the whole experience though—the lady was extremely patient and genuinely friendly, and it helped the situation immensely.

But still. It never would have happened at any other airline.

And this was all *before* the 3 ring circus of a sh!tshow going on when you go through security. If it’s Stansted, expect about one person to make it through security an hour. Hope your flight doesn’t leave today because you won’t be on it. I planned a good hour of time just for going through security, and that was even *after* the whole debacle with the boarding pass.

An hour later and I had barely moved through 3 turns in the line. Eventually I just politely started walking through the line telling people I have to go, my flight is leaving in 20 mins. Finally I get to the actual screening and guess what? Everyone is getting secondaries. **Everyone.** It was crazy, and I will not pretend like it’s some sort of protocol at UK airports to blame—Gatwick and Heathrow were like a utopian wet dream in terms of their efficiency compared to this experience. Crazy.

I did make the flight, but only because I was at a full on sprint all the way through the entire maze of money trap that lie between security and the actual gate (mine was lucky enough to be at the farthest corner of Inverness, so fortunately not too far). Last one walking into the plane, they closed the door as I got on.

Quinetessential CryinAir experience.

Just be prepared for long lines, ridiculous security, lots of low quality travelers who don’t want to spend more than $5.47 on a flight, and have your paper boarding pass or itinerary number memorized. Otherwise it’s a great time. lol",2025-04-15 13:19:24,1,JaxTaylor2,travel

The fact that Wizz turns off online check-in three hours before the flight is a dick move; I barely missed it once while still sitting at a bar in town and then had to pay to check in at the airport.

If you follow the rules on Ryanair and are ready to pay for any needed extras, it goes fine. They try very hard to be on time because they don't want to pay compensation. Their route network is fascinating, I've strung together some trips that wouldn't have been possible with mainline carriers.

My recommendation would be to talk to your father, what does he think? Perhaps also consult with his doctor for advice. Talking to your mother about what she thinks is probably also wise, as she knows him well, and knows his limitations. 


If he wants to go to Egypt, maybe a river cruise down the Nile could be more relaxing for him? He would still be able to see sights, and experience a different culture.

Are river cruises within your budget? I took a river cruise in Egypt and some of them are very accommodating. There was a woman with Parkinson’s on our cruise and she had a wonderful time. The river cruises are much better than ocean cruises, because they are much smaller and dock very close to attractions. They are also much easier than trying to use only ground transportation, because your hotel travels with you and will probably be much less stressful for your father. Also, there is a reasonably high chance you will get scammed if you’re doing a trip on your own in Egypt. The European river cruises are also nice.

Seoul just does it so so much better, AND it is all much cheaper than Tokyo (when I was going there with yen to convert to won).

It is also just a way different energy for drinking and going clubbing.

You need to contact the airline and see what their policies are.  I would not necessarily trust any notes put in your file, so make sure you have signed/notarized letters stating both parents approve of children flying alone and just with father.

Some of the biggest attractions (like the Tower of London and Westminster Abbey) are pricey, so you may want to do a little research to see if the London Pass would save you money. And remember that you may feel exhausted rushing from site to site.

There are also plenty of free things to do, and your kid may like the Science Museum and the National History Museum, both of which are free. The British Museum is also free, and if your kid is into art, there's the Victoria & Albert, National Gallery, National Portrait Gallery, Tate Modern, The Wallace Collection, and Sir John Soane's Museum.

My recommendation is to forget the London Pass and go to the Tower of London (a must-see that your kid will enjoy) in time for a Yeoman Warder tour and spend time exploring it at your leisure.

He was not a 'tour guide', so he didn't accompany us around the towns, but that was better for us as we preferred to explore on our own.  

For Montenegro, we drove to the Bay of Kotor.  I don't remember for sure, but it was at least 90 minutes or 2 hours to get there (the issue was waiting in line to cross the border).  We stopped near the Kamenari Ferry in the Bay for some coffee and a bite to eat around 930am, and then hopped on this little car ferry that crosses the narrowest part of the bay, and then drove from there along the bay to the town of Kotor.

The town is surrounded by an old wall at the base of a mountain.  It's compact and super easy to explore.  There is an old wall that you can climb that leads up the mountain to an old Church, some ruins, and an AMAZING view of the bay and mountains.

This was amazing, the bay is 100% surrounded by beautiful black mountains, we stopped at  a small man-made island in the bay, and also at a small town called Perast to explore.  We took the boat back to Kotor and linked up with our driver to head back to Dubrovnik around 330pm and were back in Dubrovnik a couple of hours later.  The ride back over the mountains overlooking the Bay was beautiful.  


Overall we loved this day trip as did our kids.  The scenery was beautiful.  I have never been in a setting like this with the bay, mountains, walled town etc.  


A couple of days later we did the same thing for Bosnia.  This was a longer ride than Montenegro, I think at least 2.5 hours or close to 3 to get there, again the main delay was crossing the border.  It was one lane for the cars and only one guy sitting there checking passports.  (Coming back was quicker, we took a different way that didn't have much of a line, and a few more booths for passport control).  

Our main stop was Mostar.  But we stopped along the way at Počitelj to climb the stairs to the old fortress overlooking the river valley.  We spent maybe 90 minutes there and then moved on to Mostar.  

Mostar is pretty compact, you can see the main parts pretty quickly.  It has a famous bridge and some really good, inexpensive restaurants along the river with views of the bridge.  By the time we got there, we were hungry and the driver gave us an excellent recommendation for a restaurant that was cheap, really good and had a great view.

We loved Mostar because it's predominantly Muslim, so it was really neat to be in Europe and see mosques rather than churches.  One was open to visitors/tourists, so we were able to go in and also climb the minaret for a great view.  

There are a lot of buildings still standing that are either destroyed, or showing a lot of damage from the war that took place in the 1990s.  It's something really good to see and remember that this didn't really take place that long ago and most of the people were alive and experienced it.  


I found the driver as a recommendation in one of Rick Steves' books.  

If you need any info or want to see some pics, please DM me and I'll be happy to send some across.  We loved both trips, and if we go back to Dubrovnik again, we would definitely do one or both again.",2025-04-01 16:37:44,3,juice06870,travel

mk3pntc,1jlhcnj,reddit,"Hiking. Just go with a guide. I did Pedra do Telégrafo with someone from Airbnb experiences. IDT it's safe enough to do hikes alone like some of us did in the past. Better to go with someone who knows the trail and the area. My favorite is Doris irmãos but you have to go through a favela called Vidigal. Definitely go with a guide. It's become a pretty well-known excursion in Rio so I think it should be fine. Pedra Bonita is a fairly short and easy hike with stunning views. Pedra da Gávea is harder and gives you similar views. 

You can't miss a sunrise on Copacabana Beach. It would be great to stay in an Airbnb or hotel right on the beach for a night or 2 just to avoid being out there. I did it many years ago but the situation was different and I went with several people. Sunset is a must on Arpoador Beach. 

I love the Forte de Copacabana. A little snack in the Colombo cafe in the afternoon is great after walking through the fort. There's a Confeitaria Colombo in Centro that you should go to but go early bc it can get soooo crowded. You'll find the Convento de Santo Antônio nearby. You can't miss it, it's white and perched on a small hill. It's incredible. The Real Gabinete Português de Leitura is also gorgeous. You'll find the Bonde de Santa Teresa station nearby and I suggest you take it and wander around the central area of Santa Teresa. Safety in the periphery seems to have declined a lot since I lived there as a student about 9 years ago but the center was still lively when I strolled around 2 years ago. If you make it to Santa Teresa you must go to Cultivar and get an açaí com granola and an order of pão. It's the best imo. 

I know it's touristy but you can't miss Cristo Redentor on a clear day. Take the little train. Idk if they still have the vans but they drove like maniacs. Pão de Açúcar is also a great spot but dedicate lots of time to it and stay for the sunset. The Jardim Botânico is really pretty and worth it imo, especially in the morning. 

I also loved going all the way to Leme which is at the end of Copacabana Beach and you can go up to the Forte Duque de Caxias. Look for the military guards who will be by the gates. You walk through a tiny park, moving away from the beach. It's a short, humid and steep hike but the views were amazing and you might see various monkeys. 

The best day trip starts by taking a ferry by Praça XV to Niterói. You can take the bus or an Uber and visit the MAC or the Forte de Santa Cruz. Amazing views of Rio. There's a big park that's great for sunset in Niterói but I haven't been. 

Another day trip would be to Petrópolis, the imperial city. In the past I've taken buses to and from the Novo Rio rodoviária. The ride is so scenic and you can walk around Petrópolis and visit the palace. 

Don't wear jewelry and don't flash your valuables. Theft can be very silent and sudden. Just be careful and you should be fine. If something feels weird or there's an empty street then turn around. If you take the metro or buses then make sure to wear your backpack in the front. I do this regardless but I'm paranoid. If you're a woman taking the metro during rush hour then go into the female only cars. Double check all of this bc things likely changed a bit since I was there as a student and a tourist.",2025-03-28 00:21:41,31,RepublicAltruistic68,travel

Christ the Redeemer and Sugarloaf are both touristy but worthwhile. Try and get there as early as you can for both to miss the massive tour groups.

However, I did always feel a little worried in the back of my mind. Two local guys who walk the trail daily for exercise for example greeted me on the 1st day of the trail and were friendly and offered to hold my backpack since we were going the same way. They were being polite and respectful but I felt slightly worried and paranoid. Another example - I took a taxi from Mestia to the coast after the hike was over and I felt worried being in a taxi by myself for hours with a random taxi driver dude. He wanted to do detours to take me to see things like a dam, etc on the way, and asked me questions about myself and if I had a boyfriend so I had to make one up. Nothing ended up happening and things were fine but it was slightly uncomfortable traveling there by myself.

Lovely country. We did a lot of home stays - which are typical lodging arrangements there - and I thought that was a really unique way to see a place. 

Adding some of southern India to that could extend your trip quite easily and extend out a few weeks. 

We are actually planning 4 months of travel with our family of 3 for next year (read: we travel slower with a young kid than we did pre-kiddo). But a huge criteria for us is visiting a place that you couldn’t really see fully with a 2-3 week vacay. Something to consider for your plans since it’s a unique opportunity. And if you deem that being important, India would fit in well since it takes time to explore there. 

Another couple of areas to look that fit your criteria would be something like a Tanzania, Uganda/Rwanda, Kenya combo. Tonnnnssss of nature and culture. You could add Kili, scuba diving at Mafia island, gorilla and chimp trekking, or Mt Meru for a physical element. 

South Africa and Namibia are rather incredible places as well (and can add Vic Falls) that you can easily spend 4-5 weeks in. Cradle of Humanity is a wonder for the ancient element, it’s pretty easy to manage being self-supported if you do some homework and there’s lots of nature/hiking.

If you have the Berner Oberland or Jungfrau pass you can get free/discounts so its worth it if you are doing a lot of trips in the area.

If you really just want to see all those places so be it. Rush a bit and see it if it's once in a lifetime.

HOWEVER.

Unless Switzerland is super high on your wishlist time and money to move around won't make up the difference in flight cost if you research patiently. Include it if it's a top 3 kinda thing, stay closer to France and the UK if it's purely a matter of flight cost.

If you keep your countries as-is I'd cut Carcassonne out for more time in either Paris or Switzerland.

It's easy to underestimate the soft time cost of little side trips especially when you're not doing it in a favorable order.

It's also pretty easy to use extra time in a single base to do the day trip spontaneously anyway if you decide you can and want to. 

Trust me when I say rushed travel can be done properly (I've done it) and improperly (also done it) and this is improper.

mn45gi6,1jyyop1,reddit,"To add a little to what others have said: at the very least, I’d recommend starting in Switzerland and working from there through France, the UK, and Ireland, so at least you’re mostly travelling in a line. I understand that you have a personal reason to visit Dublin - but it feels very out of place on this trip. Doing the UK and Ireland makes sense; doing London and Paris (debatably even London, France, and Switzerland - or as an alternative London, Paris, Brussels, and Amsterdam) would also make sense. 

I know you’ve said below that you’re not keen on anywhere in the UK besides London, that you have your heart set on Carcasonne and the Swiss countryside, and you’re visiting a friend in Dublin. Five days per place may actually be alright, but the order and transport links between them will mean you lose quite a bit of time. An additional pro for trains is that you can actually see the countryside if you’re travelling during the day. I’ve never been to Switzerland, so I can’t vouch for it specifically, but I’ve been to the other places on your list, as well as almost everywhere else mentioned in comments from others; I think deciding on if your priority is Switzerland or Dublin will help you with planning. Would meeting your friend in a different city (like London) be an option?

Edit: just noticed you mention in another comment that your friend will likely be with you in London. Honestly, while Dublin is a fine enough city, I’d actually recommend cutting from your itinerary, purely because it doesn’t make much sense logistically. London - Paris - south of France (I’d lean Lyon; you could also make an intermediate stop in Strasbourg) - Switzerland does actually make sense, and can be done by rail.",2025-04-14 19:43:20,4,Tartanman97,travel

mn2bu3y,1jyyop1,reddit,"It's not a great itinerary in regards to making most of the time you have for your trip. You have to figure that on the days that you're traveling from London to Dublin and then from Dublin to Carcassone, you're going to lose most of those days on just traveling (getting to the airport, waiting for your flight, the flight and then getting from the airport). My first recommendation would be to focus your trip on continental Europe so that you aren't sacrificing nearly three full days just on just getting to and from three cities. 

As far as the amount of time you plan in each location, again it's not a great use of your time. I generally plan on two to three nights in each individual city I visit (the exception was when I visited Kyoto because I knew in advance what I planned to do there), which generally gives me enough time to cover the major sites and a museum or two. I'm assuming that you are going to use these cities as a base and plan to explore some areas outside of the city but I'd rather actually limit the amount of time in the larger cities and plan on several days/nights in smaller cities and towns.

You also are doing a lot of back and forth on your planned itinerary, which is going to waste more time. Try to line up your cities so that you're not back tracking.

In Patagonia you have the northernmost region which includes Bariloche, San Martin de los Andes and the 7 Lakes Route (a car is needed). This is a beautiful area with ski resorts, European style architecture, mountains, lakes and forests. Crossing into Chile is also a beautiful drive.

Then you have the most distant Patagonia, which is more isolated and even more stunning.

Ushuaia is also nice but most people go there to take Antarctic cruises and/or see the Southern Lights. Puerto Madryn is one of the world’s best locations for whale watching

As for which place may be too different 15 years from now… Galapagos does a great job of limiting visitors and protecting itself do I’d say that will more likely be the same in the future.

mkm4ppx,1jn7zw1,reddit,"Just got back from the Galapagos (search my post history for itinerary), was there 2/22-3/8. Loved Patagonia as well (went as 2 separate trips, one was a 2 week trip to Argentina, incl El Chalten, El Calafate, and Bariloche, and the other was 2 weeks in Chile, including Torres Del Paine and the Chilean Lake district).  Good news is, you can’t go wrong, they all were fabulous trips! We saw plenty of groups traveling with kids in all locations.  
I also am not a boat fan, so we did a land-based Galapagos itinerary, staying 3 nights on each of the 3 inhabited islands (10 days, 9 nights total in Galapagos, with some time in mainland Ecuador on either end), and did day boat trips to the uninhabited islands. Do either of you get seasick? If so, look into the choppiness of the water in Nov. I know we chose March because the seas were the calmest on average (Nov may be fine too, just check). 

Pros of choosing Galapagos imo: amazing and abundant wildlife, very unique vacation, probably easier to combine logistically with Peru, perhaps better if you are “hiked out” after the Inca trail (not a lot of hiking in Galapagos), and I’m afraid with climate change it may be very different in 20 years (not that you necessarily wont travel in 20 years either tho). 

Pros of Patagonia: hiking is amazing (may be more difficult with young children in future), mountain views unparalleled (imo more beautiful landscapes in Patagonia >> Galapagos), Nov is a good time to go i think (we went Dec 1-15 for both Argentina and Chile, including 2018 and 2022 respectively and had great weather), more freedom to independently travel (in Galapagos most activities have to be arranged with tours with a naturalist guide, and they’re great but my husband and I aren’t “tour people” typically so it is easy to get toured out), food (imo Argentina > Ecuador >> Chile for general cuisine and food quality but obviously this is subjective).",2025-03-31 01:15:51,1,Halloweentwin2,travel

First, Galapagos is an amazing trip to take with kids. It is a perfect choice to come back to once your family is established. 

Second, it is almost impossible to avoid being on boats in the Galapagos unless you go only to San Cristobal and reject any tours involving boats. The other island with a full airport is Santa Cruz, but even then the airport is on Baltra with a short ferry ride to Santa Cruz.

Good plan!

> Also, would you recommend staying in a central location like Malaga and do day trips to nearby cities (less hotel hopping)

It could be a good idea, if your kids don't mind being in a car too much. But I wouldn't go for Málaga. Just yesterday I was talking to someone from Málaga and he spent the whole lunch saying how Málaga has changed a lot since he was a boy, and Córdoba is his favourite place in Spain. He's not wrong; I'd recommend you stay in Granada or Córdoba, both much nicer than Málaga. Málaga is a more typical Spanish city, you'll get a lot of that in Madrid and Barcelona.

> We are interested in beautiful scenery, unique/picturesque towns, some beach activity (not a lot though), and moorish architecture. Not interested in big museums or art galleries.

Some recs:

- For beautiful scenery, see el **Caminito del Rey**. Kids under 8 can't do it but yours should be old enough for it. Don't try to rush through it though, make it a day trip. Or el **torcal de antequera** as an alternative.

- **Observatorio de Sierra Nevada**: If you have kids who get bored with history, you can try something different like visiting the observatory. They only do a few visits in July and August so [check the dates](https://www.osn.iaa.csic.es/en/general/guided-visit). Not sure if the tours are in English too, might want to ask. You can combine this with some sort of astronomy tour somewhere in the cities you're visiting (there were many important astronomers in Al-Ándalus during the Islamic Golden Age, many living in Sevilla or Granada, such as Jabir ibn Aflah who invented the torquetum). I'm not sure if they do guided themed tours like that around the cities, but worth a look. If not, I'm sure they do other themed tours that the kids might enjoy.

- Unique/picturesque towns: **Setenil de las Bodegas**, **Alhama de Granada**, **Guadix** (for cave-houses). There are also endless **pueblos blancos** (white towns) in Andalucía, ex. Algatocín, Casares, Gaucín, etc.

- For Moorish architecture, if you're really into it, see **Madinat al-Zahra** when in Córdoba. It's mostly ruins so might not be so interesting to you and may not be worth the detour if you have just a passing interest in architecture. But my history teacher loves it and recommended it as a must-visit if we were in the area (for history fans, that is).

- For the **beach**, it's better to save it for when in Barcelona. In my humble opinion, the beach at Barcelona is disgusting and I'm really not sure why people enjoy it. If you're into it, take an early-ish train (it takes 1.5-2h, and late trains are common, so better get on a train before 9am) from Barcelona to **Tarragona** and make it a day trip. The train ride goes along the coast so you get great sea views. In Tarragona they do have a good long beach and also lots of Roman ruins (it's UNESCO), so you can have a walk around town after the swim. Another Barcelona day trip is **Montserrat**.",2025-04-12 12:16:21,3,NotACaterpillar,travel

seville 3 nights - need 3 nights minimum, I felt like even then there were things we didn't have time for

cordoba day trip (on the way from seville to granada) - obviously felt very rushed but I'm happy we didn't take time from seville/granada. I imagine the city would feel very different overnight once the day trippers leave.

granada 3 nights - one of our favourite cities in europe, id recommend staying in the Albaicin for views of the alhambra

malaga 3 nights - spent 1 day in malaga, 1 day trip to Ronda and 1 day trip to do the el caminito del rey. I would only stay here as a base for day trips. Good seafood, otherwise the food in granada/madrid/seville is so much better with less tourist traps. So many tourists walking around. Felt pretty underwhelming after coming from Granada.

mne3vzj,1jxedqe,reddit,"Hi! If you're planning a trip through southern Spain, I’d definitely recommend arriving in Seville and renting a car to explore Andalusia. Driving gives you the freedom to visit beautiful towns and coastal areas at your own pace. We rented a car in Wiber y we do not have to leave a deposit. Just to control the kilometers.   
Here’s the itinerary, since we were last year.   
  
1. Cádiz (3 days). From Seville, drive down to Cadiz. Stop at Setenil de las Bodegas and Arcos de la Frontera on the way. 1–2 days in Cádiz, one of the oldest cities in Europe, full of charm and history.

2. From Cádiz, head down the coast to Tarifa, stopping by Vejer de la Frontera, a gorgeous white village to spend some hours. Tarifa is perfect if you’re traveling with teens. great surf vibes and a cool atmosphere. Spend a few relaxing days there and go to beautiful beaches.

3. Granada (2 days). Visit the Alhambra, but book your tickets at least one month in advance, they sell out fast! Two days in Granada is enough to explore and eat tapas.

4. Ronda. Then head up to Ronda. It’s a small town and very walkable. 1 day is enough to see

5. Córdoba (2–3 days). One of the most unique cities in Andalusia. Don’t miss the Mezquita and the beautiful historic quarters. 

6. Back to Seville, return the car, and spend at least 3-4 days exploring the city. So much to see: the cathedral, Alcázar, Triana, tapas everywhereeee! 

7. Madrid by AVE (high-speed train) from Seville (super easy). Spend 3 nights. 

8. Take another AVE from Madrid to Barcelona.just 2.5 hours. And 4 nights in Barcelona. Architecturally, it’s breathtaking, especially compared to Madrid, although Madrid’s cultural life and tapas scene are amazing too.

We used Wiber Rent a Car in Seville airport and it was super smooth. No depossit, no charges, and full insurance.",2025-04-16 11:32:10,2,FullComfortable2277,travel

mmqbogg,1jxedqe,reddit,"You don't need 3 nights in Ronda and/or Malaga if you're considering a trip all over Spain.  Would just leave Sevilla early in morning and do Ronda as a stopover for the day and then go on to Malaga.  Ronda is not that big and will probably be overrun with tourists in July (and with heat and humidity it could be brutal).

Your trip is not just for southern Spain.  I feel Malaga is skippable to spend more time around Madrid or Barcelona.  Unless you're really there for the beach.  So if you arrive in Malaga at night from Sevilla via Ronda, you can spend the next day  in town (so just one night in Malaga) and then leave later in the day for Granada.  This opens up 2 nights for you to extend elsewhere.

You also have some wiggle room with 2 nights in Cordoba.  One day seems sufficient and many just do a day trip. But with 2 nights you can squeeze in a part day trip to Caminito del Rey with a car as someone mentioned.

Toledo is not a maybe.  If you're in Madrid you have to go there.  It's easy and convenient.  A visit to Segovia and Avila is also easy.

Having a car for Andalucia region is a great idea.  The roads and highways are excellent.  Don't bother getting the prepaid electronic toll booth sensors from the rental car agencies which are extremely expensive.  There are seldom ever any car lines, tolls are cheap and there are scanners that read credit cards.  But be very mindful that indoor parking is insanely tight.  Don't rent anything larger than a midsize SUV.  Even with a regular sedan locals require a bit of time going back-and-forth by inches to squeeze their cars into lots.

Days 1-5 Seville, day trip to Cordoba, day trip to Jerez or Cadiz. Also, you’ll be getting over jet lag so add a buffer day in

mky9xzn,1jox5ek,reddit,">At least a few in proper yurt encampments

Staying in a Ger is more of a Kazakh thing - so a ""proper"" (authentic, nomadic, belonging to a family) yurt encampment is best experienced in the sparsely populated western regions of Mongolia. 

Inner Mongolia has a big domestic tourism industry so think most yurt places you will find will be geared up for Chinese tourists wanting to cosplay as Mongolian, and will be fixed in place and very touristy. Not saying nomadic ones don't exist, but will probably be harder to find, or hard to find a guide who is able to take you (Chinese domestic tourists don't really crave authenticity so tours aren't set up for it). There are encampments along the Kubuqi desert, but I know a lot of them are big tourist things.

And also not saying the tourist stuff won't be fun - gers are cool - but if you're trying to do a photo project it might not be what you're after. Unless you want to take the Chinese tourism angle which is interesting in its own right.

I've only really been to the area around Hohhot, but it's an interesting part of the world. Try and find a Mongolian guide rather than a Han Chinese guide if you want to get more accurate info.",2025-04-02 01:03:04,4,mcwobby,travel
mkyz3ta,1jox5ek,reddit,"Hi! Your trip sounds absolutely amazing – and not at all offensive, don’t worry. You’re clearly being thoughtful and respectful, and that’s what matters most. I think you’re going to love Inner Mongolia – it’s full of breathtaking landscapes, rich culture, and warm hospitality.

Don’t worry about getting bored – 5–6 days in the grasslands is definitely not too long, especially with your plans to ride, hike, cook, meet people, and take photos. The scenery changes a lot depending on where you go, and there’s always something new to experience. You might even wish you had more time!

For staying in the wild or in traditional yurt camps, you can absolutely arrange some of it in advance. Apps like Xiecheng (Ctrip) for travel planning and transport, Meituan for food and general services, and Rednote (Xiaohongshu) for lifestyle content and local tips can be really useful. Many people share their itineraries and even contact info for reliable local drivers or small group tours. These apps are mostly in Chinese, but your boyfriend should be able to help with that.

Yes, some travelers do just find a driver after landing, but if you prefer certainty (understandably!), it’s worth booking in advance – try Rednote for real user recommendations, and WeChat groups too if you can get in. Look for drivers familiar with the Hulunbuir region – some are used to working with visitors and can help you stay in authentic yurt camps and even introduce you to local families.

Hope you enjoy your trip! ❤️",2025-04-02 03:50:21,3,MousicaWalker,travel

mkau7bf,1jmbdxz,reddit,"15 to 20 lbs is on the light side, but a common weight limit with Taiwan's China Airlines and the three China-based airlines - Air China, China Southern, and China Eastern.  Most American airlines have carry-on size restrictions and the only weight restriction is that you are able to lift it up into the overhead compartment; e.g. I hate check-in luggage and I have often traveled with no issues just bringing on a small backpack, a camera holster, and a densely-packed carry-on weighing 40-50 lbs when flying inside U.S. and throughout Africa.

China Airlines states the 15-lb carry-on weight limit on their website:

[https://www.china-airlines.com/us/en/fly/prepare-for-the-fly/baggage/carry-on-baggage](https://www.china-airlines.com/us/en/fly/prepare-for-the-fly/baggage/carry-on-baggage)

But whether the airline actually weighs your carry-on and enforces the weight limit is what REALLY matters, and that highly varies from airline to airline, and can even vary depending upon which ticket agent you walk up to.

China Airlines has never weighed my carry-on.  South African Airways also states a 18-lb carry-on limit (8 kg), but they have never weighed my carry-on since 2006 when I first started flying on SAA, and I have carried a 50-lb carry-on aboard for 2-month African trips flying from New York to Cape Town.  On the other hand, I have had my carry-on often weighed by China Southern and China Eastern since 1998 and both China Southern and China Eastern ticket agents have told me before that I had to lighten my carry-on, so I had to transfer some items from my carry-on to my wife's carry-on and check-in luggage.

The really weird and nonsensical aspect of the airlines weighing the carry-on and enforcing weight limits is that you can usually pick out the heaviest items from your carry-on and put them inside a purse or (in my situations) my backpack ""personal item"" that I stow under the seat and the ticket agents are okay with that lmao; i.e. the carry-on weight limit does not cover the TOTAL weight of ALL items that you are bringing on board the plane, but just what is on one carry-on (or the two carry-ons that some Business Class tickets allow) and I have NEVER had my backpack ""personal item"" weighed, nor do they ever weigh my wife's handbag.",2025-03-29 03:10:59,2,KrunchyPhrog,travel

And, while it can happen anywhere of course, the trans community is welcomed in both countries so the chances of being treated differently are relatively low compared to other destinations. 

I lived in Portugal (Peniche/Lisbon) for 3 years and now been living in Spain (Barcelona), so I know both pretty well.  
If you prefer exploring smaller, quaint towns off the beaten path I'd definitely stick to the north of both countries -- the Algarve and south regions in Portugal and all of southern Spain are known for their tourism, so you'd likely find big crowds in most places.

I'm partial to places like Guimaraes and Braga in Portugal, which see a lot of local tourism but not that many international travelers. Same goes for the north of Spain -- if you got the time and want to do a big chunk El Camino, I would recommend leaving from Bilbao, but it takes about a month to do the trail from that far out. Other amazing cities you can visit and then start the trekkng El Camino from are Gijon (15 days more or less), Lugo (7 days), and La Coruña (my personal fave in terms of city, 5 days).

mk5odi4,1jlqm0x,reddit,"Seoul is a larger and more hi-tech city than Taipei (e.g. it has its own navigation app ecosystem, which includes live information about buses, subways etc. and even the timing of traffic lights if you're driving). There is some great hiking within city limits in both cities: Taipei has the ""Taipei Grand Trail"" around the perimeter of the whole city (it is surrounded by mountains on most sides), you can even get a physical map at the city's trail planning office. It also has Yangmingshan National Park. Seoul has Bukhansan National Park.

I love the bikesharing system in Taipei (YouBike) and it extends even into some popular neighboring tourist spots (e.g. between Houtong, the ""cat village"" and Ruifang). Taipei's easycard is also pretty convenient, you can use it for youbikes, payment in stores, public transportation etc.

In Seoul, Cheonggyecheon was a great little nature spot in the middle of the city. It's a stream that was covered up to build a huge elevated highway cutting through the city, but in the early 00's, they turned it back into something of a park where you can walk alongside a stream for miles. It's where I would run when I stayed in Seoul. Another thing we did that was great is walking around the Old City Wall, Hanyan Doseong. Obviously it's not the original wall, it had to be rebuilt and refurbished a lot since it was first built in the late 14th century and some sections are missing, but it's still super interesting imho. It's a good 6-hour walk if you stop a few times, but not for very long (it's close to 25 km IIRC). You can also get a certificate and a badge if you take pics at the 4 or 5 (can't recall) pre-defined spots and then go to this little office at their museum and show them your registration number or whatever after uploading the pics to their website first. The badge is cute and they have different colors for each season and if you do it in all 4 seasons, you get a fancy metal-colored one.

Overall, I find Taiwan to be better for (impressive) nature. The central mountain region is absolutely stunning as is the east coast between Hualien and Yilan on a nice day. Sadly Taroko Gorge will take a while to re-open I think (it was severely damaged by the earthquake).

Foodwise, I prefer Korea, but night markets in Taipei are fun. Raohe is my favorite. Every time I've been there I stayed the next street over. I would run along the Keelung river - the riverside parks all around Taipei are fantastic - and pick up something to eat at the market on my way home.

I have a bit of a love affair with Taiwan, though. Can't really tell you why. It's a pretty unique place, it never gets very cold (I'm no bothered by oppressive heat), I love the mountains, I love the spas in Beitou (reachable by subway). And in some ways it's like ""Japan meets China"". I like Taipei and Hualien most. Lots of fun spots reachable by train from Taipei in the north, including hikes and bike rides (e.g. look up ""Old Caoling Tunnel"" - you can rent bicycles outside the train station, pick up a bento box and go on a 20-something km loop that takes you through some countryside then out onto the coast via an old railway tunnel turned bike-and-pedestrian tunnel). Lots of serene nature near Hualien. Kaohsiung is probably my third preference. It has subway lines and trams and Shoushan is a nice way to spend half a day watching the stupid monkeys and walking around different areas of the hill. Tainan has great food, but its public transportation is lacking, it's a bit sprawling for me and the mountains are too far. I have somehow not spent any time in Taichung and only passed through Chiayi so I can't speak to those places. Alishan is also worth it and if you like higher mountains and hiking, you can also do Yushan, ideally in 2 days, but it takes some planning, because you need to book permits and spots at the lodge.

Oh yeah, the people. By and large polite and helpful in both places, but pretty closed off in both places. I feel like the Taiwanese are a bit more open though. And Taiwan has fewer grumpy grandmas.

One last thing I just remembered, pollution. It can get pretty bad in Seoul, especially in winter and early spring. Summer and early fall should be OK I think. Taipei doesn't have this issue most of the time, but OTOH it's really cloudy usually. Hualien being on the other side from China and also being a small city has none of these pollution problems. Tainan and Kaohsiung can get some pretty nasty pollution both blown over from China and from domestic industry. As far as weather, summer and early fall is typhoon season in Taiwan, so a multi-day typhoon, while not likely, is entirely possible. This means staying inside on those days if it hits Taiwan head-on. But overall I think early fall is a great time to go to either place.",2025-03-28 09:36:13,42,hungariannastyboy,travel

mmp2r8f,1jx0no6,reddit,"The trip is comfortable but you should expect delays in Germany. 20 minutes is more common than on time.

Whether this is a problem will depend on the way you buy the ticket. A website like trainline or omio may sell you two separate tickets (one for Paris to Frankfurt, another from Frankfurt to Leipzig). This is dangerous because if you miss the connection the train company for the second ticket doesn't have any obligation to let you take the next connection without paying again. The better (but sometimes more expensive) option is to buy the whole journey through DB. This ticket will cover the whole trip on a single ticket (including the transfer) and in this case, if there is a delay and you miss the connection, you can just board any other train going the same direction all day. No need to see or talk to staff. If it were me I would buy the whole journey through DB. If you want to be sure, use the option on the DB Navigator app to make minimum connection time 30-40 minutes and it'll give you around an hour in Frankfurt to change.",2025-04-12 06:59:11,5,thebrainitaches,travel

I'd rather reserve a bit more time for transfers and instead have a small bite at the station.

Also: nearly 2/5 of your traject between Paris - Frankfurt is within Germany. If your connection was within France I would maybe worry less, but with German tracks involved I wouldn't feel too comfortable on such little time gap for transfer.",2025-04-11 21:23:37,15,dagvogeltje,travel

It’s a really chill place. I’d recommend staying in casca viejo where a lot of the nightlife is and everywhere should be accessible by foot (if not uber is SO cheap there). 

Although I will say Panama felt extremely safe (as a guy) and I was never worried about walking around by myself day or night. The nightlife is pretty good (check out Selina in Casio viejo if you go, it’s a rooftop bar on top of a hostel with many internationals and you can see the whole city skyline). There’s also Cielo another rooftop bar and there’s a zip line in that same building too (37th floor I think) if you’re into that. 

You can visit the fish market and haggle with ppl for the cheapest meal (they basically all sell the same thing but the seafood is bomb, esp the ceviche). You can also book some catamaran cruises and meet a lot of locals and foreigners on vacation too (also how I met people), like the one that goes to Taboga island (they also anchor so you can swim/snorkel, sun bathe). Also check out Cantina Del Tigre it’s a sick restaurant and there’s food/drinks are bomb (best on my trip).

Also the coffee is amazing (check out the geisha coffee - you’ll be wanting to bring as many packs home if you like coffee) - check out UNIDO & Sisu coffee (best breakfast sandwich ever @ UNIDO)

If you have friends to show you around in Brazil tho they can def maximize your time and make sure you don’t step foot in the wrong neighborhood which is a big advantage, so if that’s an option I’d do that although I still don’t think you’ll see all of Brazil in 4-5 days whereas that is enough time for Panama.",2025-04-18 20:53:53,12,Airgelo,travel

mnrheql,1jzo3eq,reddit,"The best advice I can give is: just approach people. Start small talk. Even if you’re shy or feel awkward at first, that’s exactly where you’ll learn how to connect better.

Asking “how long you staying?” or “where you heading next?” gets repetitive real quick, but those basic questions open the door. It’s not really about the question itself.

I also didn't stay at hostels, until the money ran out and I had to. Some are dead quiet, people just sleep and isolate. Others are super social. I’ve seen yoga/hippie-style calm ones and also really active, young, party-ish hostels. Mad Monkey was probably the most socially engaging one I stayed at. So choosing the right kind of place matters.

Also, do activities that you genuinely enjoy, not just to meet people. That energy attracts others naturally.

One thing I once read under another post stuck with me: “Don’t hold on to people. Hold on to memories.”
Sometimes you vibe for a few days, exchange socials, then never talk again. Or a month later, you quietly unfollow each other. It’s normal. But real, long-lasting friendships can still happen.

Just be open, show up, start the convo, and let the rest happen naturally. You’ll be surprised how much flows from just saying “Hey, where you from?”",2025-04-18 14:20:43,2,weirdozed,travel

Expat pages on FB can be really helpful. Do some research on where people go to relax and hang out and go there before getting on the plane. A lot of expats (not immigrants) tend to move between countries every few years, so chances are you bump into people. They can also connect you with others.

This should cover two or three days, with time to spare for walking around, some souvenir shopping and great food. There is definetely more to see, but trying to pack too much would feel rushed.

mop7sut,1k6blcm,reddit,"To preface, I've lived in Montenegro for over 11 years. I also travel from Tivat to Budva multiple times per week, including the summer.  I would not go to Montenegro in July, June, or beginning of August. In fact I always try to leave the country during July/June or at the very least travel to the north/mountains, where it's cooler and less touristy. IMO the best time to visit Montenegro is September or the start of October - the weather is perfect for swimming, there are less tourists and the prices are back to being normal. 

During July it's incredibly hot outside(35-38C), and there are constant traffic jams. Also the prices increase significantly, especially in restaurants/cafes – I've worked in a few, there is literally a separate menu with a higher price(same food) that is used during the summer. Last year a car trip that takes 30 minutes took me 5.5 hours. Generally, travel to Budva from Tivat off-season takes 30-45 min, during summer that time increases up to 2 hours. The bus between Tivat, Budva and Kotor is not great(idk about other locations, but I doubt it's much better), being off schedule and occasionally not arriving at all. Also idk if it's true for all buses, but no AC in the ones I've been on. Personally during the summer I would avoid road trips at all costs, the time spent is not worth it.

If you have to go in July, I would honestly book a nice hotel/apartment in Petrovac near the beach and enjoy the nice views and beaches of Petrovac. If you choose to rent a car, take a day trip to Cetinje, Perast or Stari Bar+Virpazar. If you do end up living in Petrovac I would visit Kotor old town as it's very near and the travel to it is from the side that is usually fine in regards to traffic. If you live further and have to approach Kotor from the other side(e.g from Budva or Tivat), I would skip it, even during the off-season there is usually a traffic jam at the entrance to Kotor, due to the way the road is built. IMO Sveti Stefan is skippable, very expensive restaurants and not much else going on. If you choose to go to Virpazar, also visit Stari Bar. Luštica Bay may be a nice place to have dinner/lunch - very nice views, great beach, blue cave and restaurants(I like ""Chedi""). If you arrive in Podgorica in the morning/noon I can recommend going to the Lipa Cave before heading to the coast. I would also eat in Podgorica before going to the coast, it's significantly cheaper, I really like the restaurant ""Spago"". I would definitely skip Budva, Podgorica, Tivat(only thing worth visiting for a tourist is Porto Montenegro/Boka Place, the beaches aren't that nice, it's expensive and there are a lot of tourists. Trust me, I live here), Nikšić. Depending on what type of vacation you prefer, I would consider spending 2 days in Žabljak, they have very scenic hiking trails, lower prices, few tourists, but it may be harder to get by without speaking the language.",2025-04-23 23:46:40,9,sadatomicpony,travel

I would skip Budva personally. I thought it was a dump.

Kotor is amazing and I would spend most your time there. There can be delays getting in on the bus as there is a small tunnel leading to the city that causes traffic jams. Perast is an easy half day trip from there.

**Taberna Carolina**

Tucked away in an alleyway right next to the world-famous Livraria Bertrand bookstore, this place was awesome. Inside, this century-old tavern has been turned into a cute, quaint, and cozy hideaway... managing to make you feel far away from the hustle and bustle of the city, and balancing a traditional Portuguese feel with just a few modern touches. There is outdoor seating available, too. The recipes are based on those of one of the owners' grandmother, and the restaurant focusses on using Portuguese products exclusively. Amazing food, wonderful service, great atmosphere, and extremely reasonable prices. I still dream about the shrimp from here.

**Boca D'Uva**

This was where we went for our last night in Lisbon and I feel like it was the best dining experiences I have ever had. Again, cozy, quaint, romantic atmosphere. Again, tucked away in an alleyway which you could very easily miss if you weren't paying attention. The restaurant is the partnership of a chef and a sommelier, and each are masters of their craft. The food is slightly elevated modern takes on traditional Portuguese dishes. Every single thing we ate or drank here was perfect. For reference, my wife spent years as a bar manager at several mid-high end restaurants and bistros, and I spent years as a photographer and marketing manager for a hospitality group which owned several nice bars and restaurants—so we have been fortunate to have had access to lots of fantastic meals and drinks in the past... but nothing checked all the boxes quite like our experience at Boca D'Uva.

If you book a flight TO, FROM, or IN the US, you are entitled a 24hr grace period to cancel any flight for a full refund , even if non-refundable. Usually has to be a flight a week+ out.

So while you are waiting at your gate. Book a oneway flight (maybe a month in advance) to the US, show the gate, fly, land, go through customs where they will look the flight up, get your visa stamp, cancel. Full refund.

Reason to wait to cancel until after your visa stamp, some customs officers will look up the flight. Better to be safe than sorry.",2025-04-18 22:30:44,7,Royal_Payne,travel

mmk2dbj,1jwp0kt,reddit,"Hi, I’ve only been to northern Argentina so I’ll give you a few tips on that. Salta city is well worth a day, the historic center is beautiful and has really nice churches, make sure to visit the mummies! Driving is not necessary for the city itself, you can walk. At night go to La Casona del Molino to experience a true northern peña, but make a reservation because it’s popular among tourists and it fills quick.

Right behind Cerro de los Siete Colores in Purmamarca you have “el Paseo de los Colorados” which is a circular short walk that takes very little time and has wonderful views.

There’s a MAJOR spot missing from your itinerary: Serranía del Hornocal / Cerro de los 14 Colores is a massive and beautiful mountain, which you should def visit. A regular rental car won’t be good to drive that road, so you need to either rent a 4x4 or pay for an excursion there. At sunset it truly is magical, don’t miss this.

The Quebrada de las Señoritas is a nice hike with “Martian” red landscapes all around you, that departs from the tiny town of Uquía and takes 2-3 hours.

The drive from Purmamarca to Salinas Grandes is beautiful on itself, make sure to make all the necessary stops.

The drive from Salta to Cachi goes through the famous Cuesta del Obispo which is beautiful, do this during the day and with a clear day, you’ll love the views. Make sure to stop at panoramic spots.

You can visit the Cuevas de Acsibi from a town near Cachi, you’ll need to pay for a private tour that takes you there (it’s private property) and you can get it done in 3-4 hours usually.

The road connecting Cachi and Cafayate is in horrendous condition, do NOT take your rental car there unless it’s a solid 4x4. The Quebrada de las Flechas is a beautiful natural spot in the middle of this road, it has an amazing panoramic stop, but it can destroy any regular car. Renting an excursion is also a good idea.

In Cafayate there are 2 major beautiful wineries that require reservation: Piattelli and El Esteco. In my opinion San Pedro de Yacochuya right next door is just as nice. You can do all 3 in a day if you want. Make sure to drive the Quebrada de las Conchas road and make all the necessary stops, it’s a breathtaking route, you’ll feel you’re visiting another planet at some spots. The small restaurant Milla7 on the highway is fantastic, great food and views but it fills up quick.

Most tourists never make it to Tucuman province, but from Cafayate you can also do a day trip to Tafí del Valle which is a beautiful valley town in a nearby province. I did horseback riding to see the views, it was absolutely worth it.

mmn2j12,1jwp0kt,reddit,"You shouldn't miss the Uyuni tour. It has some of the best landscapes in South America. I'd say cut a bit of the northern Argentina stuff so that the itinerary works. Can't advice you on what as I haven't done most of that.

San Pedro, I'd say 2 full days for tours is enough since some of the stuff there is similar as things you see on the Uyuni tour. Staying in San Pedro also helps with altitude acclimatization.

The Uyuni tour one way San Pedro-Uyuni is 3 days 2 nights, shared tour costs around $200 and includes everything. I've also been end of April, most of the salar is dry (looks a bit like snow but it's so huge it's still very impressive as it's all you see) but the guide knew where to find water to see the mirror effect at sunset which looked magical.

From Uyuni there are morning flights to La Paz (also night buses but you'd prefer the flights as I understand). So do that the day after you arrive. You can explore La Paz for the rest of the day (use the cable cars to get around, they also have great views).

I think there are some direct buses from La Paz to Cusco but they take like 15 hours, so if the schedule allows it I'd spend some time at Lake Titicaca in between. I prefer the Bolivian side, from Copacabana you can take a boat to Isla del Sol which is a cool hike if you have like a full day to spend there.

mkbsxmk,1jma4u7,reddit,"Been to Mallorca couple times - in July and September.


We always stay in Palma and explore from there. Palma has nice architecture, is great to walk around. We always pay a little extra to be closer to old town (but not too close ;)). You can visit the cathedral, Palace Almudaina, and have some ensaimadas.
 
Research and book restaurants - it can get busy and we were surprised how many were just average. The better ones are usually packed if you don't have a reservation.


From Palma you can easily explore nice beaches in the east and mountains in the west. 


In the east we really liked Cala Pi and Es Trenc beaches. If you can drive a scooter consider renting a vespa (we got one from Vintage Mallorca). Especially in Es Trenc we could drive up and park close to the beach while the car park was packed and a little further away. Depending on how long you want to stay there pack water and some lunch as there wasn't too many restaurants nearby. 


In the west you can drive to Valdemossa and then to the coast or venture further North to Formentor (we were glad we had the vespa on those narrow roads).
 
If you don't want to drive all the time the popular tour by old train to Soller, tram to Port de Sóller and boat to Sa Callobra was fun too. Touristy and can get crowded but we were lucky with little to no crowds and really enjoyed it.


No matter what you plan, I'm sure you're gonna have a wonderful stay in Mallorca!

Porto’s also super close to some other cool places like the Douro Valley, Braga, and Guimarães. You could easily do day trips from Porto and explore more of the area.

mlvt2u4,1jtkpsj,reddit,"I did this trip a few years ago- we rented a car in Tirana and spent 2 nights in Dhermi and 4 in Ksamil. Our focus was the beach. One thing I didn't anticipate was how long it takes to get anywhere- the drive along the coast was significantly slower than what Google maps predicted. It's a stunning drive, though.

One night in Tirana feels right- there are enough interesting sites, and I might have appreciated not making the drive to Dhermi in the dark. The Vlore pass is kind of wild in a dinky rental car. 

I liked Dhermi- it's a cute little beach town that feels really secluded and has amazing views. I'm not sure if you will still be able to get a boat from Dhermi to Gjirokaster, but it's an ""easy"" drive from Dhermi and the hike is nowhere near as bad as web sites lead you to believe. It's worth it. 

Ksamil was a great spot for beach and access to Butrint and the surrounding area. There is decently good tourist infrastructure. We did a day trip on a small boat, visited Butrint, and generally relaxed. 

From there we drove to Saranda to drop off our rental car and hop on a jenky ferry to Corfu. I'm glad we didn't spend time in Saranda, but the British teenagers on our Ksamil boat trip enjoyed the clubs there. 

We didn't explore too much of the interior of the country, but we did transfer from Skopje by way of Ohrid to Tirana, so we got a good sense of the mountains then.

On one hand, there are definitely more tourists now than 40 years ago. I think overtourism has ruined the feel of many places and I wholeheartedly agree that places around the world are becoming less ""authentic"" and looking more and more similar by the year. Hotel rooms look pretty much the same everywhere. And I think this will only get worse.

However, it's also true that crowds are very predictable and thus can be avoided at many (if not most) sites. I'm less familiar with Prague, but you also mention Barcelona as an example. La Sagrada Família is double more crowded at 2pm this week than it was at 2pm last Thursday. Tourists travel by season. And it's not full of people around 9am, most arrive by 11am. People come to Spain and see the popular sites in BCN, Madrid, Toledo, Sevilla... and then leave. The hundreds (thousands?) of other towns and cities that exist in Spain are far from crowded with tourists. It's very easy to have an authentic Spanish experience and have sites to yourself. 

People talk about how crowded Japan is these days, and I agree. But I'm still by myself at 80% of the places I visit. I recently came back from Venice... where it seemed everyone was walking the same few streets and visiting the same 3 museums. The rest of the city was very quiet.

Back in the mid 1990s, there were far fewer tourists in Europe compared to today, so it was far easier to visit many of the major tourist attractions.I visited the Roman Forum. I was able to walk freely everywhere. The last time I was in Rome, many parts of the Roman Forum were roped off and you had to queue to get access to them. Back then, I could also walk freely up to a platform (no charge) in the Coliseum to get a really good view of the inside. Now you need to pay to get beyond the outside gates. The Champs Elysee in Paris was a far more pleasant experience back then than it is today. Access to major museums like The Vatican Museum, The Louvre, The Uffizi Gallery, the Prado Museum, etc. was just a matter of queueing for about 30-40 minutes.

I travelled by rail. The Thomas Cook rail timetable book was a godsend and obligatory for co-ordinating schedules.

There are not a crazy amount of tourists everywhere, it only seems so if you follow the herd.

Tourism has certainly increased significantly over the years, but it is still easy enough to avoid the tourist crowds if you want to. 

> All this makes me wonder: How was travelling like before internet and online influencers?

Depends on the person, type of trip one makes etc, but for me not fundamentally different other than that technology makes things (research, route finding, communication) a lot easier, with growing older my attitudes and priorities have changed and I make different choices. The only real difference, if any, is that now I may decide to skip places because of expected crowds.

People travel more now because it's easier and more affordable, not because it's ""fashion"". A more severe recession would affect travel (and apparently, so many more aspects of life) greatly. Apparently, the future of travel depends on the future of global economy and international affairs.

Influencers only play a tiny role in all of that. The likes of TUI, Expedia etc are the ones who dictate where tourism is headed.

ml4bz7p,1jpz06k,reddit,"I'd only ever use the public transport in Switzerland.

It's absolutely amazing and one of the joys about visiting the country. It goes absolutely everywhere, runs frequently and is easy to use and is flexible. You never need to book standard daytime trains in advance.

It is absolutely no problem when hiking and going to national parks. They are all very well linked with public transport, it really does go almost everywhere you can drive and more. I've found the public transport much more convenient to use. Buses often stop nearer trail heads then you can park. And if you want to go up the mountains then cable cars and narrow gauge trains get you further than the road network. And as you've said some mountain towns are car free and even when not parking is a massive nightmare.

It also means you can be more flexible with your hike. Eg if you want to keep going or come back early just do exactly that from a different spot. Also means you can split up. Rather than all having to return to your car. And it means you can do some great one way hikes and hence see more.

If you rent a car be prepared to pay hefty parking fees, use public transport to get back to your car because it‘s not a loop hike, expect very small parking spaces et cerera.


that being said: in very rural Switzerland you often have to wait an hour for Postauto/public transport, there might be things you want to do that takes twice as long by public transport than by car, and you seem to be used to driving wheareas you‘re not used to Swiss public transport (which is easy enough to navigate though I assume).

In the end, it‘s about convenience and what you want to do. If you want the ‚true Swiss experience‘, use trains. It you want to see as much as possible, use a car - because you can stop anytime without worrying about your next ticket (if you don‘t buy the Swiss Pass).

Personally i don't think you need two nights at Nerja... one is plenty. I'd even just not bother staying over and  just do a stopover at Nerja for a few hours on the way to Malaga. I'd rather add an extra night at Sevilla to do a day trip to Arcos de la Fronterra and Jerez de la Frontera, and just see/eat more of Sevilla. And with the extra day (or two) at Sevilla, you'll have a bit of extra time to explore the white towns of Olvera and Zahara de la Seirra in the vicinity of Setenil de las Bodegas after Ronda.

Just small tweaks based on a fairly recent visit.

Oh! The other thing also is that you may want to consider driving the reverse order somewhat of Malaga>Granada>Cordoba>Sevilla>Malaga. Only because the drive from Sevilla to Malaga was actually quite beautiful... you can see the Rock of Gibraltar in the distance along the way and you go through spectacular landscape somewhat along the Mediterranean and part of it on elevated mountain highways.

Tips - Get your Caminito del Rey entry and parking tickets in advance.  Do the rooftop tour of the Sevilla Cathedral (advanced tickets also needed) which is awesome fun and you get to see impressive vantages and hidden areas that you can't with the regular entry. Just saw you don't have tix for Alhambra (yikes) if you can't get in consider using that time to go to Jaen (north of Malaga) or do a daytrip to Nerja and add the extra time to Sevilla.",2025-04-02 21:35:54,1,GrantTheFixer,travel

There's a fun hike at Echo Lake on Highway 50 on the crest of the Sierra Nevada range. You can hike around the lake and take the water-taxi back. You'll have to check if this is open yet.

Its a short hike, but when in North Shore, take the hike to Monkey Rock. Its only a mile or so, with some bit of climb. There was a rock which looked a little bit like a monkey. So a local artists embellished it a bit.

On the East side of Emerald Bay you can hike down to Viking's Holm which was an early estate built like a wooden Viking castle.

If you’re outdoorsy and not afraid of some possible snowy mountain driving (if you rent a vehicle), I highly recommend driving up to Lake Tahoe. I truly believe everyone needs to see it at least once if they’re near it. I spent lots of time up there and in the Sierra Nevada. It’s incredibly beautiful and a great place for solitude, but you might run into some people congestion near the ski resorts. Depending on where you’ll be in Reno, it’s a drive that can be made in under an hour. 

Virginia City is also very cool.  Also a little bit of a drive up the mountains but it’s on the eastern side so there’s a good chance you won’t run into snow. There’s an old cemetery, old mines, a cool old schoolhouse you can tour, old bars with original rails, beautiful homes, etc. it looks like a true western town but it can be a bit of a tourist trap.  There’s also Genoa about 45 minutes south of Reno, I believe it was the first settlement in the Nevada Territory. That can be incorporated into a Lake Tahoe trip easily. Minden/Gardnerville are down there too and there’s a very good Basque restaurant there - good place if you’re unfamiliar with the culture. 

Reno itself: Midtown has some cool stuff and good restaurants. Downtown is obviously full of casinos so you’ll have no shortage of gambling and drinking options.  The Eddie in particular is really cool, it’s an outdoor bar with games and other stuff.  Not sure if they’re open yet.

I’m also from BC and ICBC will not do anything here. Get a credit card that covers the CDW and by law, all car rentals in the EU have to cover liability so you have no choice as its baked into the price you pay.

2. Driving is fine. Main highways are very well maintained. Tolls can be paid by credit cards. Don't understand the expensive comment. It's reasonable... don't take back roads unless you have tons of time to spare or have a reason to do so.
3. Look at the terms of your insurance. Likely doesn't cover the excess. You can get cheap car hire insurance before you travel. Sometimes, your credit card offers it. But essentially, you just get a hold on your credit card like normal.
4. Parking in the main cities will be annoying and expensive. But manageable. Just research where you can park. Preebooking parking in secure places can be cheaper.

I also live in North America and driving in France last year with my mom was a pleasure. The rental vehicle 
 warned about speed traps and cameras and made alert sounds if I was speeding. In Europe they seem to be culturally strict that you should be driving in the slow lane unless you’re passing a car. I was in the middle lane of a 3 lands road having a nice drive when a car sped right up on my bunker and honking hysterically and then went around me screaming through the window. I noticed on empty roads that people always moved quickly to the right lane.There was almost NO traffic and I only saw one accident in 9 days (I usually see multiple accidents just on the way to work). 

A minor confusing thing for me were the speed changes meant for exit ramps (but the car would give me alerts for not slowing down, when I wasn’t exiting).

We used Sixt both times, both times they scrutinized every little knick or scratch, basically the size of a human hair, upon return. It was ridiculous. I’ve rented a few times with enterprise in the states and it’s way nicer. Maybe try hertz or enterprise over there too. 

Driving on the main highways (A roads) are beautiful, wide, have rest stops, etc. super easy driving. 

Look up “Aqueduc romain des Clausonnes” on Google maps. Just below it you’ll see like a 10 lane toll booth set up right before getting into Nice. Most toll booths are easy, every one you just tap your credit card and you keep going. This one has certain lanes for pass holders that i went into. I pull up to the booth, no where to tap my card. I had to reverse out, cross 5 lanes to where it had the bank card logo and thankfully I didn’t get T-boned. It’s a pretty wild set up. 

Try and get the smallest car for your needs. The really small villages have parking lots walking distance from the windy narrow streets of the main village so it’s not a big deal to park in places like Gordes or Lourmarin.

Bear in mind that one way rental is very very expensive. Return rental is very cheap.

Just go on kayak and search. I have rented cars all over Europe in the last 20 years. There's not much difference in the lower end of the budget market.

As for insurance, it is EU regulation for them to have 3rd party insurance included as part of the rental price.

This meant if you were to injured somebody else with the car, the insurance will pay out as compensation to that 3rd person.

However, there is a huge excess charge - sometimes in the region of 2-5k.

The person at the front desk will pressure you to buy an all inclusive insurance to reduce this excess down to zero. It will be more than your rental cost.

The way around this is to buy a car rental excess insurance. But if you don't live in Europe, i am not sure if there's such thing for you.

When comparing car rental price, please check what's the excess charge and any cost to reduce it.",2025-04-20 05:11:42,0,ukfi,travel

I'm not sure, how often this is checked, but I had a warning from German sim provider about my extensive data usage in local roaming / within European Union.

Otherwise, your best bet would be researching prices in cheaperish EU countries (Eastern Block) and find a tariff, which provides the roaming at its full capacity (compared to 20gbs provided by your husband's carrier) and hope for the best, that you won't be annoyed by carriers for misusage.

Alternatively, you could do same in your home country and just get few extra sims for mobile router or as 2nd esim/internet sim in his phone.

My theory is that Japan never being invaded resulted in a lot of people staying generation after generation in various towns and cities, allowing a lot of them to develop their own unique cultures. Korea has been invaded constantly, so most of the population has been refugees or were forced to abandon their villages and cities for various reasons at multiple points over the past two centuries. Where in Japan you will find hotels and restaurants run by the same families for generations, Korea simply doesn't have that because of the long and brutal Japanese occupation and the absolutely devastating Civil War.


All that said, Korea still does have tons of interesting sites. Anyone saying ""you can do Korea in a week"" are out of their minds. While I would do 4 weeks in Japan and 2 in Korea, you could easily fill up 3 weeks in Korea or more depending on what you want to do.

In Granada province you can look into canyoning excursions and self-organized hiking around the Río Verde, stunning nature, and Granada while a bit touristy (but honestly far from the worst in Spain to that regard) is a crown jewel of the country and must-see.

Mobile signal is patchy at best and every sign will be in Mongolian/Cyrillic.

The tour packages for Mongolia are mad expensive for some reason and I don't recommend it. I tried those £3000 ones several years back since it was my first time and it was too packed with activities. No time to breathe, forced to ride poor horses and camels, constantly thrown into different yurts.

Lots of guesthouses in Booking com and Airbnb. It's probably better to book early and inform the hosts, since most of them actually live in the capital and only stay in the yurts during summer / tourist season.

In short: Book in different ger camps in your preferred regions and ask the hosts for their driver friends :)",2025-04-25 06:54:40,1,cashmerehoney4,travel

The path between Bergen and Oslo was some of the most beautiful landscapes I have ever seen. Both of those cities are well worth exploring, and there are good hikes around Bergen, but you're also going more off the path than I did, which sounds delightful (I plan on returning to Norway only to go further north).

mnnryxi,1k1me4b,reddit,"Porto is one of my favorite cities in Portugal, and I'm glad that you are including a stay in the Duoro!

A few years ago, I spent two nights in the Duoro as part of a larger trip.  I took the train from Porto and stayed in Regua at the Hotel Régua Douro, which is across the river from one of the Six Senses resorts that was way out of my budget.

Over those two days and two nights, I was able to see the surprisingly excellent museum in Regua and take the train further into the Duoro up to Pinhao, where I went wine tasting at Quinta do Bomfim.  (Unfortunately, I arrived to late to experience their winery tour.)  I ate and drank very well (and very cheaply at local places) those days.  I would have loved to have an extra night in the Duoro, and I'm sure that I could have done much more had I rented a car.

3 days in Porto, and during those 3 days, book a Douro Valley tour with local guides – the Douro is about 100 km from Porto, so it’s totally doable as a full-day tour. The other 2 days are more than enough to explore the city.
Spend 3 days in Lisbon, but on the way there, stop in Nazaré and Óbidos. They’re stunning places!
While you're in Lisbon, I also recommend visiting Sintra.

If you want to add a second island for 1 night  Santorini or Paros are both good options. Santorini will be very packed with tourists but it is beautiful and you can check it off your list.  Paros is another good option for a short visit since it is so close to Naxos.

mouialg,1jueoqv,reddit,"(Athenian Greek here!) 3 nights in Athens is definitely too much, 1 is about right, 2 if your flight lands late at the day. The historical center is definitely worth a visit (plaka, Parthenon, Acropolis museum etc) but that is a days worth of walking around. Also check for a concert at odeon of Herodes Atticus, and going up lycabettus hill. If you want more information on that do tell me. Other than that Athens is a residential city built on the last few decades, so I would recommend against staying longer. There are a lot of hidden gems of course, but not worth it on such a tight schedule.
As for where to stay, metro is fairly robust in Athens so anywhere on the blue or the red line will do (avoid the green one if you can, it is substantially older but still serviceable in a pinch) there are of course some more sketchy parts of the city so take that into account. Do NOT rent a car in Athens. Parking is hard, the drivers are terrible, and the metro is good.
I recommend this for a nightime coffee/drink/food (haven't actually eaten here, frequent it for drinks): Cafe Telescope in Haidari. You have a view of the entire Athens on your feet.


Stay away from Mykonos and Santorini at August. Santorini at least is very beautiful, but you will literally be unable to walk on the streets. Visit on April or October if you want to see it.


Naxos is very nice, much less touristy (while still having good tourism infrastructure) and is 4-5 hours by ferry from Athens. Easily a 4 day destination if you want to visit the smaller villages (has about 40 of them) , has good Beaches, the main villages and the main town are very picturesque and ought to be a lot cheaper (recently stayed at Hotel Anatoli at Naxos and can easily recommend it). You can hike up the mount Zas (highest point in the cyclades), and there are a couple of ancient temples to see. Also Paros is just next door, as well as other cyclades islands, so you can do some island hoping (check FerryHopper app)
Definitely rent a car. You can do without, but would highly recommend going around with a car as it is a rather big island.


Crete is its own thing. Definitely rent a car, and consider spending your entire stay there other than a day or two at Athens. It is the fifth biggest island in the Mediterranean and has been inhabited for the past 8.000 years. Local food culture is great. Consider taking the overnight boat or go by airplane since it is rather far away from Athens.


Counter argument, stay a night or two at Athens, rent a car from Athens, go up to delfoi and meteora to the north, stay the night at kalambaka, then go back south towards Peloponnese (ancient Olympia, Mycenae, ancient Nemea, ancient Corinth, Nafplio, Ancient Epidaurus, Diros caves for some natural marvels, methoni, koroni, Kalamata, so many beaches to choose from) and it will be much cheaper than the islands at August",2025-04-24 19:54:21,2,Secure_Sky7469,travel

mlwkdez,1jtrgs6,reddit,"I've been to both Albania and Georgia. Even though I did both with a rented car, it looks like Albania might be a better option from public transport perspective. However the food is so much better in Georgia.

Given your circumstances I'd say go to Albania. It's close to Greece and it might be cheaper / more convinient to stay in the same area. 

If you like mountains / hiking there's one absolutely fantastic thing you should do in Albania: hike in Prokletje. The views are astonishing. You need to get to Shkoder (there's plenty of public buses from Tirana). From Shkoder you can go to Valbone. There are tourist mini-buses which can take you to the ferry on Komani lake and then by mini-bus to Valbone. It's just a village from which you can hike one way to Theth and return back to Shkoder. The whole trip needs at the very least 3 days (but you can easily extend it with more hikes). The lake, the mountains, everything is one of the best experiences in the area I had. For mini-buses you probably can find a good deal online. I booked everything from the hotel desk in Shkoder.

I'm not sure when you are planning to go, but make sure the season is already open. Prokletje is amazing in summer, but it might have plenty of snow early spring / late autumn.",2025-04-07 18:26:18,6,avaika,travel

* I'd cut one more city out of Vietnam, it's where your trip has the most redundancy. I personally cut Da Nang out of my Vietnam trip, and Hue would be my next cut in your itinerary unless you have a specific interest there.
* Ninh Binh, Ha Giang, Ha Long, and Sapa are all variations on a theme, I think it's fine to pick one or two and leave the others for next time. I personally chose Ninh Binh and Ha Giang, but Ha Giang requires more time than your itinerary allows for.
* Angkor needs more time, 2 whole days minimum (1 for the main loop, 1 for outer temples). It's the climax of a first-time-in-SEA itinerary!",2025-04-04 14:38:03,3,Gerode,travel

If I were you I'd take out the south of Vietnam and swap it for Ha Long Bay and more time up north in Vietnam. 

From Hanoi, fly to Phnom Penh if you're interested in the Killing Fields and The Tuol Sleng Museum. If not, skip Phnom Penh and swap it for more time at Ankor. Make sure you get a good guide there, you can visit this place by yourself but you'd miss out on a lot of information.

After Siem Reap, fly to Bangkok and spend more time there. Thailand is relatively safe to drive through by car as long as you stay on the main roads. Consider renting a car for the places that are within driving distance such as Erawan, Kanchanaburi and Khao Yai. These are great for a road trip through the country.

Another thing I do feel I should add is that there are plenty of places in Thailand that are fantastic for snorkeling. I feel it's a missed opportunity to see the underwater world and something very different from your trip.

If you plan on visiting the Rainbow Mountain and Humantay lake make sure you're properly acclimatized. Both are at high elevation and you might suffer of altitude sickness if you don't take it easy the first couple of days.  

I would suggest to stay in Ollantaytambo at the end of the Sacred Valley tour and then head to Machu Picchu. On the way back, you can just go back straight to Cusco. But, this is just a personal preference.

On lake Titicaca, I've done the overnight stay on Amantani Island and had a great experience. But it all depends on whether you need your comforts or are okay to spend the night like the locals do. 

I've spent a night in Arequipa and then did the Colca Canyon 2 day trek. All the tour operators are around the main square, so I recommend to best check it out yourself. Most of them offer similar experiences, as there are only 2 main accommodations in the canyon. You'll most likely spend the night at the oasis, so every tour operator would aim for that.

On the last day I would include a walk in the Père Lachaise cemetery, Montmartre can be easily done and the 9ème arrondissement part (also you’ll be close to the rue Sainte Anne if you want to eat Asian food) will be done quickly. And maybe relax in the Buttes Chaumont. 

Also on the day when you visit the Louvre you’ll be close to the inha / BNF Richelieu. It’s a public library with frescoes and you can visit the gallery next to it. It’s rather close - you’ll also be close to the Palais Royal with the Colonnes de Buren

Nb : I might sound unrealistic and it’s maaaaaybe because I was born in Paris and still spend an awful amount of time there but I’ve already crammed a whole visit of the city within three days. My main concern there will be the rather long queues you will experience

In the alternative, you could keep your itinerary as is, but take the train out to Brasov one of the days you’re in Bucharest.

mmw21mv,1jy646b,reddit,"I love Kamakura, but... I'm afraid you've chosen the most boring sites of the city lol. Hokokuji is nice though.

Tsurugaoka Hachimangu and Komachi street are both horribly crowded, some of the most crowded spots in Japan, and it's the only place in the country over 10 years of travelling where they've tried to scam me. It's so crowded that moving becomes very difficult (and I was there in low season). The shrine is historically relevant, but unless you're a big Minamoto fan then it's nothing amazing and can easily be skipped. Hasedera is also very crowded a comes across a bit gimmicky since it's in a touristy area.

For Kamakura, I believe the best parts are the hikes, tranquil temples and history. Last time I was there I started at Kita-Kamakura station, then did Engaku-ji and Kencho-ji, two very beautiful temples. From Kencho-ji you go to the back of the temple, up the steps, and that's the start of the Ten'en trail. At the end of the trail is Zuisen-ji, and you can easily add Hokokuji which is nearby. If you *are* a big Minamoto fan, go see Yofukuji Temple ruins and the grave of Minamoto Yoritomo. From there, a bus to Kamakura station and the Enoshima railway to Enoshima. This is a more temple and nature focused loop rather than a shopping / tourist loop.

RE: Okinawa. One day for Naha is good, two if you want to go to the Navy Headquarters. Shuri castle is interesting (make sure you're there at opening time, you'll hear the gong when they open the gates), then you can walk down to Shikinaen passing by Tamaudun and Kinjocho Stone Paving. There are places where you can see bingata dyeing, ex. Shuri Ryusen. Then Kokusaidori, Makishi Market, Tsuboya Yachimun Street, down to Fukushuen Gardens. Naha is quite an interesting city.

After that though, I'd recommend leaving Naha and going elsewhere on the main island. The nature is a big part of Okinawa's charm and it's hard to see the best of it in the city. I loved Seifa-utaki and then walked to Tamagusuku, on a different day I went to Kudaka island, then a day in Nakagusuku and finally Uruma island. However, you can also go to some of the other islands if you want a different experience, there are many to choose from.

My new rule is if we’re already spending a couple thousand on flights, we will spend a couple hundred extra in case we have to cancel or change.

You can find hotels with small pools away from Casco Viejo, like the Riu, they're fine but don't expect US 4-star quality. Most places in PTY are a bit rundown. I've been to PTY probably over 20 times but I don't remember a pool I would have been excited to lounge at for hours.

Personally I'd rather sacrifice pool and stay in Casco Viejo if its your first time. Walkable, nice views, away from traffic chaos, you can even walk to the Cinta Costera from there.

Other ideas to fill your days:  
  
\- Miraflores locks  
\- Wildlife tour on lake Gatun  
\- Metropolitan Natural Park  
\- Ancon hill

Also, as far as walking, DO NOT walk randomly from somewhere like Ancon hill (nice hike!) to Casco Viejo. San Felipe neighborhood is no joke, and NOT a place for tourists, even if it looks like it would be a 20 minute walk.

You're unlikely to find a nice hotel with a pool there, but don't stay in the grid area between Santo Tomás and Estación Lotería metro stops. That's where I stayed because I'm cheap, but most of the hotels there are dismal and often meant for sex work. But again I am very cheap, you are unlikely to stay anywhere I've stayed.

If you have any desire to arrive to places dry, just uber everywhere. It's cheap and air conditioned. You're going in the wet season. I did it last year, walked a lot, and either it's sunny and you end up drenched with sweat or it's raining. I realized on one of my last days that I hadn't had a single day where I didn't go back to the hotel wet, except that day, because I rented a car to go see an archaeological site. And then it dumped rain on me as I was leaving.

The metro works fine, but the last station close to Casco Viejo, ""Estación 5 de Mayo"", is still quite far away. It's worth walking once, Av Central Espana is a busy market street, or there's a row of little shops underneath the Pan American Highway viaduct. I never took the bus.

ml5w2ho,1jq6ezf,reddit,"Just a word of warning - Luanda airport and TAAG Airlines are both the absolute worst I've ever used. We flew from Johannesburg to Sao Paulo and back via Luanda around Christmas 2022. It was absolutely awful.

The airport was total chaos. There was no toilet paper or soap in the bathrooms. The only open shop was one expensive Duty Free store. There was one café with horrible food and the worst coffee on earth. 

The signs showed information that was hours out of date so finding the right gate was essentially guesswork- walking up to other passengers and asking ""is this the gate for the Sao Paulo flight?"" until we found it. Once we found the right gate and they checked our documents, they let us through to a smaller area to wait for a bus to the plane. We sat there for over an hour with no information about what was happening and couldn't get back out to get water or snacks. Then suddenly the bus showed up and we went to the plane without any kind of explanation of why we were so delayed.

The ridiculousness continued on the plane. Many of the seats were broken - permanently reclined, broken armrests, missing seat cushions etc. The in-flight entertainment system didn't work at all and the remotes had been ripped off several seats and bare wires were sticking out. When I tried to activate my reading light in the aisle seat, my daughter's reading light in the window seat turned on instead, because they'd been wired up wrong. It's genuinely the only time I've been concerned that I might die because the plane was in such poor condition - if they couldn't even wire the lights correctly, what else had they got wrong?! 

The return journey was the same. The only slight positive is that the plane was almost empty so each of us had a whole row to ourselves and could try to lie down and sleep. I say try, because the arm rests didn't fold up all the way in the middle seats so you had to wedge yourself in under them.

mkuqx33,1jov3e3,reddit,"1. All you have to do to view the Black Madonna is head to the church and hop in the queue off to the side of main church entrance. When I went (August), I'd guess it took about 30-40 min. to progress through the queue and then you'll go through the Madonna ""tour"" over another 20-30 min. You won't have an issue seeing the Madonna and that portion of the Monastery is open all day (or close to it). I believe you can just go in/out of the church itself via the main entrance as you please.
2. Probably a few hours without any rushing required, it just depends on your pace. It looks like guided tours take 5-7 hours (incl. travel to/from Barcelona), so that's probably about as reliable a source as there is.
3. You'll have plenty of time for it, so you might as well
4. It's hard to say when you've only been there once, but I was there during the high season and while there were plenty of visitors that day it never felt especially crowded. There's enough space and enough different things to do or see for the Monastery to accommodate *a lot* of visitors at one time.

A lot of destinations depend on tourism quite heavily and need people to actually spend money in the community instead of just spending money on hotel and flights. I am of the opinion that if you are travel somewhere be prepared to spend money outside of your hotel and try to focus on buying from local businesses (example: instead of booking with a big international company that hires local guides just book directly with the local guides or eat lunch at a locally owned restaurant instead of the familiar international chain).,2025-03-28 21:28:55,3,zara97wild,travel

mka1ons,1jm0w4v,reddit,"Kotor to Perast is a 15 km drive, unless you are on a tight budget you could consider taking a taxi if the busses are not available. Keep in mind that Perast is a tiny, albeit beautiful, place. You need like 20 minutes to explore it all. I'm not sure how long the boat ride to the island is, but I have a feeling it's a shame to spend a whole day on just Perast and the island. Maybe take a look at the Kotor cable car, from there you get a sort of similar views as you'd get at Grlo Sokolovo.

I've checked the link for that tour, and I agree with you, two hours in a boat sound a bit like a waste of time, as the view from high up down on the lake is much more impressive than the other way round. Driving 15-30 minutes from Virpazar already gets you to some great lookout points, it's a shame they don't do it in the tour. Keep in mind that Virpazar itself is tiny, but situated on a really beautiful spot.

Budva Old Town is nice, but sort of similar to Kotor Old town. You don't *need* to do them both.

Looking at your itinerary, I have a feeling you're spending way too much time in Podgorica.

I'd suggest looking up these things:

1) Ostrog Monastery - even if religion isn't your thing, a place like this is not common.

There's also the very cool Kunsthof passage, the military historical museum, the most beautiful dairy shop in the world Pfunds Molkerei, the Heide forest for hiking/ walks. 

The Old Town is historical and very gorgeous. My favourite museum is there: the Residents' Castle, and within 5 minutes you can reach the Zwinger, the Opera house (which is gorgeous, incredibly well known, and if you enjoy that kind of thing, seeing a performance there is wonderful). 

Not to mention Brühlsche Terrasse, which is beautiful, the Frauenkirche, the Kreuzkirche, the Hygiene Museum (despite the name, it's not about soap). The Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister ia a great museum as well. Or you could visit the Panometer.

RE: Shibuya sky. Note that the Metropolitan Building in Shinjuku is free if you want views. There will be queues for sunset time, so go early.

Somebody else mentioned that Takayama doesn't need a full day, but I disagree. You couldn't realistically go from Hidaji Onsen to Shirakawa-go and see stuff, so your Takayama day is more of a half day. There's plenty to see/do to spend a day in Takayama so your itinerary is good as is.

Another poster also mentioned some other cities (Shizuoka, Atami, Nagoya, Osaka, Nara, Kobe). Nagoya and Atami aren't worth including, neither are particularly attractive cities. Shizuoka city is nice if you like history, particularly prehistory / early Japanese history, but few people go there. I don't personally care for Osaka much (personal opinion, others like it), it's similar to Tokyo which you're seeing plenty of. You can do nice day trips to Nara or Kobe from Kyoto though.

moxr4nw,1k6wt57,reddit,"Hi guys,

I recently launched a small expedition group for remote travel enthusiasts, and this year I focusing on the Pamir region. I'm a Belgian traveler who's been nomadic for almost 12 years. I've explored over 90 countries and I know that region quite well.

About your trip:

1. Bishkek – Ala Archa – Suusamyr Valley – Toktogul Reservoir – Tashkent – Samarkand – Panjakent.  
Until there it seems great! I can share with you some foodie/drinking place in Tashkent/Bishkek.  


2. Fann Mountains/ 7 Lakes  
7 lakes will be the easiest to access from Penjakent, but the hike isn't that interesting, many people go there by car. If you are looking for a better hike I recommend going to Artuch and from there you can go to Kulikalon lake. I can share the contact of some guesthouses in Artuch and you can negotiate the transport from Penjakent too.  


3. Dushanbe  
Not much over there but at least one city in Tajikistan seems great, There a couple of okayish places I can also send them to you (to try traditional food, tea, or very local underground bar, depending on what you are looking for,...).  


4. Fly to Almaty (rent a car there) – Cholpon Ata – stopoff at Skazka canyon – Karakol for hike to Ala-kul – Saty for Charyn Canyon – Altyn Emel?  
  
This part, I am not so sure, cause you'll basically go to Kazakhstan then directly go to Kyrgyzstan, skip a lot of spots. Also Cholpon Ata is mainly a resort for Kazak/tourists, if you are looking for more authenticity it could be good to consider other places. And about Afghanistan, only the border Shir Khan Bandar border (Tajikistan/Afghanistan) is open with an entrance visa but mazar-i-sharif isn't that interesting you'll need to go further for that.

One solution, could be to still integrating the Pamir, stopping in Ishkashim (in the Pamir region) on a Saturday morning for the Afghan market, and going until Osh (Kyrgyzstan).  
From there you'll have bus/flight to Bishkek/Almaty.  
In terms of days, you'll most likely miss Karakol lake and Cholpon Ata but still have stunning views.

5. Almaty for flight back  
Almaty is great, surrounding and people too. You can take local bus from the city center to access the mountains (less than 40min by bus).  
  
**Note:** Make sure to apply to Tajik e-visa as soon as possible if you only hold a UK passport.

mosy7ma,1k6o2vk,reddit,"You mention you are having doubts due to potentially having to do a lot of traveling from place to place which is kind of confusing because (as far as I know) this is the way almost all safari tours work.  The drivers (guides) pick you up from your accommodation in the morning in their LandCruisers, you drive to the national park you are doing safari in for the day, you wait at the entrance while the guides go pay the entrance fees to the park, and then you go in and drive around all day on safari, and then they drive you onto your next accommodation for the evening. So there is no ""wasted time"" really because there is no way around the traveling time to and from the national parks every day, unless you decided that you were just going to stay super close to one place and go there multiple times, but I would highly suggest checking out most of these places separately because they have totally different vibes and different wildlife as well. Ngorongoro was my personal favorite - absolutely breathtaking, with Serengeti a close second.

If I had to make any suggestion, I can't tell from your itinerary if day 1 and day 7 are actually safari days in the safari truck, but I can say that even though the whole experience is unforgettable and amazing, I was definitely kind of happy not to be driving around in the safari truck all day after like day 4, so if it is in fact 7 days of safari that might actually be a bit overkill and tiring by the end. What we did, which turned out to be an excellent decision, was after the 4 or 5 days of safari we took a little bush plane from Arusha over to Zanzibar. The food was SOOOOO much better than food on the mainland. We stayed for a few days on the beach near Paje and then the last day in Stonetown. The beach and the town were gorgeous and much more relaxing than mainland as well. Stonetown's got a super interesting east meets west, old European/Middle Eastern/Indiana Jones vibe and the beach experience was comparable to or better than many southeast Asian beach destinations. Some gorgeous hotels there.

Please be careful of the heat. It's all still manageable, but just be aware.

> July 12-14 - Days 10-12: Seoul (K)
Instead of taking a shinkansen all the way up to Tokyo, we have decided to take a 1h50 flight to Seoul and get a small taste of South Korea. Our flight leaves at 10:30 AM. We will mainly see the traditional old town, some palaces, and grab some Korean souvenirs and food.

I assume you're aware that Hiroshima airport is really damn far from the city? It's about an hour by bus, so considering the check-in and security check and immigration, it's gonna take a while to even get in the air.

> On Day 14 we will visit the Akihabara area. As a child who grew up with lots of Pokemon, Mario, and Nintendo, I intend to find my inner child once again. Depending on how the day goes, we might also visit the Tokyo Tower this day.

Would you prefer to explore the Pokemon Center shops (e.g. Shibuya), Nintendo shops (e.g. also Shibuya), or the Mario theme park in Osaka? Akihabara is fun, but if you're expecting lots of Pokemon and Nintendo, it might be a bit of a let-down.

> I suppose it's maybe a sight for about an hour, finding some nice viewpoints, so afterwards we will explore the Shibuya area a bit more. As dog lovers, we also want to see the Hachiko statue, in honour of our loyal friends who sadly aren't with us anymore.

Frankly the crossing and statue are only going to take like... 15 minutes. Do explore shibuya proper.",2025-04-23 07:18:52,5,rirez,travel

Kanazawa is, to give you a quick and dirty dutch comparison, about the size of Utrecht (little bigger, apparently) and it feels like a quiet but interesting mid sized city. And just to set your expectations, the preserved historic districts, especially Higashi Chaya are going to be very touristy, and, to my mind, the thing I remember least about Kanazawa. The city has an excellent fish market with many food stalls, the castle has great grounds while the buildings within are, like most Japanese castles, modern reconstructions, and the cafes and bars nestled along the canals leading to the Yokocho nightlife area of Kanazawa is fantastic for a low key, walking heavy day.

mo1osh8,1k3e9mv,reddit,"I live in Spain, I use Iberia very frequently, and unfortunately can confirm your fears. The airline has improved significantly over the years. Inflight service is generally great now, their on-time record is excellent and Madrid is actually an efficient hub that works well, other than ongoing baggage problems. It is absolutely their Achilles heel. 

It doesn't seem to matter if your final destination is Madrid or you are connecting in Madrid. Bags to the belt in Madrid can easily take an hour even if the airport is quiet. I've had connecting flights with transit times of one hour and four hours, and they've failed to get my bags on the flight to my final destination. 

All of this said, my experience is that 8 out of 10 ten times they get it right. A 20% fail rate isn't particularly good but based on probability, your bags should make the connection. 

If they don't , here are some of my tips to ease the pain of the entire process:

1. While you're standing at the belt in Lisbon waiting for the bags start filling the claim online, effectively doing the Property Irregularity Report (PIR- airline speak for lost bags) before the belt stops.  This can be done via a QR that can be scanned at airport or find the link on their website before you travel. Do this immediately, it can always be cancelled. If you don't, you'll be forced to wait in what will likely be a long queue at the airport, with others who have lost their bags. 

2. When you need to answer the question of whether to deliver the bags to your destination or pick them up at the airport, choose pick them up at airport. Delivering the bags is obviously easier for you, but it's another complicated step in the process and it doesn't work well. Iberia contracts with third parties (like most airlines) to deliver the bags from them to you and my experience is this step works poorly too. By choosing to have them hold the bag at the airport you eliminate this risk and likely delay. I've had situations where they couldn't get my bag to me after four days, and it's very frustrating. In typical Iberia fashion they had little information, they will tell you it's out of their hands and then might even blame you. Lisbon airport is very close to city centre. It's easy to get to the airport. You should receive text messages that say what the status is and what flight your bag is on. When you receive this go to the airport to pick it up. 

3. If your bag doesn't make it, don't hesitate to start buying necessities immediately. They are legally responsible for payment for many things but not everything. Clothing and personal care items for sure, electronics less likely to be paid. Save all detailed receipts with explanation of what everything is, but don't file the claim until you receive your bag. If you file the claim early, they'll agree to it and tell you this is your agreement and they will use that to prevent further claims. Ultimately if they don't find your bag (they will) you'll want to do a lot of shopping to replace what you've lost. Start that process early. Buy as much as you can or have you immediately. 

4. The online portal to track your bags doesn't update in anything close to real time so don't depend on it. When they find your bag you will get a text message that is accurate. Then go to airport to collect. Calling them is a waste of time. One person will tell you one thing,  another something completely different, within a short period of time. This is particularly true if you choose to have the bag delivered to your hotel or residence which is another reason why you should pick it up at the airport. Once it's out of the hands of Iberia in the airport and in the hands of the delivery company they have no information and no control. 

The key to surviving this is to take a few steps to mitigate your risk. Obviously don't pack everything in the checked bag. Keep very very important stuff like medication with you on the plane. Always take one day's worth of clothing and some toiletries with you on the plane as well. File the claim online and early and choose to pick it up at the airport which gives you more control over the entire process. 

Please understand I'm not trying to scare you but I'm just trying to give you insight into the process and share the things you can do to make it better for you. 

I take about 10 Iberia flights per month so I have a lot of data points to draw from and these are my conclusions and this is what I've learned to do when it happens to me. Worth noting I've written to them several times to tell them how awful their baggage services and in particular that they have a serious problem in Madrid but they don't respond to that and nothing ever changes.

First off, the person that recommended all the Milwaukee stuff is spot on. It’s a great town that offers a ton of things to do and food to eat without being overrun by people. 

If you happen to be here July 21-27, one of the world’s largest air shows takes place in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. It’s an experience! Housing costs are ridiculous, but it’s drivable from Milwaukee if you’re going for the day. 

All of the places you’ve mentioned a good- the Dells is overwhelmingly touristy, but if you want a water park, it’s a good option.

Milwaukee also made National Geographic’s Best of the World list in 2023.

It is only a short train ride north from Chicago (or a quick drive if you rent a car).

If you come July 3-5, you can attend the last weekend of Summerfest, which is one of the largest music festivals in the world that takes place on the shore of Lake Michigan.
https://www.summerfest.com/

Additionally, the Milwaukee Air & Water Show is July 19-20 also on the shore of Lake Michigan. 

You can rent kayaks and kayak up and down the river and into Lake Michigan, stopping at bars and restaurants along the way. You can take a fishing charter on the lake as well. Like Chicago, there are lots of events and festivals in Milwaukee during the summer, though they are generally less crowded and more affordable than those in Chicago. There is a well regarded art museum near the lake, and for the kids there is a downtown science museum called Discovery World.

For sports, you could attend a Milwaukee Brewers baseball game and tailgate beforehand (grill out in the parking lot while the kids play catch). Tailgate parties before the baseball game are popular in Milwaukee and there is a distinct ‘murica vibe to it that you may enjoy.

There are excellent restaurants, a large beach, and many other things to do. This website is a good starting point.

\- depending on where you're coming from, Sept 19 may be a dead day, tired from the flight and/or jet lagged

\- Sep 22 and Sep 25 are travel days, 5-6 hours on the train, plus packing up, getting ready, checkinginto a hotel, trying to get your bearings, etc., so you're not likely to see/do much those days.

\- so that gives you 2 days Berlin (with one day at the marathon) and 2 in Prague. Both of those cities are worth more time.

\- Both Salzburg and Innsbruck are good for a day, and easy to access from Munich.

\- I did the MUC-FRA train in October, catching a flight out of FRA. Generally you'd leave first thing the the AM for an afternoon flight.",2025-04-15 01:05:52,3,Quesabirria,travel
mn6fy8p,1jzewyr,reddit,"It does seem a tad bit rushed. I get the urge to see as much as possible in a short period of time but if you’re rushing from one city to the next you may end up missing out on stuff. Make a list of the essential things you want to see/do/eat per city and then a list of maybes so you can focus on the stuff that’s important to you. 

I did 2 months through Europe last year and made a rule to do 3-4 nights minimum per big city and 1-2 per small city. I only did 1 night at a few cities where I was able to book an overnight train or bus to my next stop. That way I was able to enjoy the city for 2 full days. Left my baggage at my hotel for a small fee, there’s also company’s/apps that will store your baggage for a small fee.

I’ve been to Prague and Munich and they both fell in the 3-4 nights type of cities for me. I did 3 in Prague and 4 in Munich, I also did a half day tour to see the famous “Disney” castle for my partner and took a train ride to Salzburg for the day and enjoyed some night life in Munich after. 

If I were you I’d extend Munich and see more of that city, potentially do a half day trip to whatever interests you. I used viator to book tours, but logged in through rakuten to take advantage of 6-10% cash back. 

Or instead of extending Munich perhaps go stay in or around the Black Forest or even Strasbourg for 1-2 nights before heading to Lucerne/Frankfurt.",2025-04-15 03:42:22,2,Skittlepreet,travel

2. Yes, you'll have to show your ticket to actual people. In Barcelona: twice, once before going through security and one to get onto the actual train. Maybe later in Madrid before boarding your train. However, you will not miss these people because they will be in the middle of the your way as you proceed. 

3. Perfectly fine to print in B/W, or to show on your phone. Make sure it's high quality though, as sometimes the scans are unfriendly.

4. Not difficult. When you get off the train, find a staff member and they will tell you either the platform your second train departs from (in that case you can board the train directly, sometimes they even accompany you), or they'll ask you to go to the waiting lounge with big screens (it will depend on the time you have for the change, then you'll have to show your ticket again to board the train).",2025-04-14 18:10:59,4,hydr0dynamics,travel

The food is SIGNIFICANTLY better in Mexico, and Oaxaca in particular is a paradise for food. The flipside is that Oaxaca is also a lot more touristy and definitely more expensive. However, you can also head down to Puerto Escondido from Oaxaca proper, which has a lot more backpacker vibes; it's a big surfing spot so you'll meet a lot of people from all over the world. From PE you can also head down to Zipolite (big hippie refuge in the 60s with extremely crunchy vibes) and/or Mazunte (the setting of Boca Del Cielo in the movie Y Tu Mama Tambien. Mazunte in particular is just a HUGE beach with gentle tides and ramshackle hostels (Zipolite has a MEAN riptide, don't go in the water deeper than like your knees); I was there with some other backpackers and literally ALL we did there was swim during the day, smoke the cheapest & worst weed on earth at sundown, and eat cheap tourist food and drink margs at night. CDMX is really fun and varied and you'll be hard pressed to find better food for as cheap as it is; the Coyoacan market legitimately changed my life, and Chapultepec is nearly the platonic ideal of a public park.

Nicaragua though is going to have significantly better hiking and natural experiences. Guides are cheap, hostels are plentiful, and getting around is generally pretty easy.

mm68qti,1jur5gi,reddit,"Main reason it may not be cheap is if you are looking too short term (under 3 months) or it's very popular time to travel (school breaks, national holidays). Or both in worst case.



Best way to find flights is usually to check google flights for companies being able to fly the route you want and then going to their Web site to book it. 


Layover flights with low cost carriers is usually self transfer. And that means no protection from missing flights due to delay, and going over multiple bookings. I advise against it unless you have a lot of time to spare and can easily cover unexpected bigger expenses.



Low cost companies I know that fly from Belgrade are Wizzair (within Europe mainly) and FlyDubai (Asia). 


To find really cheap flights can take time and likely won't be simple go to one web site and book it. 


My advice is to look at google flights for routes and book one of those. That will be cheapest with most security and comfort. And since Belgrade does tend to be more expensive, always check Budapest, Vienna, Timisoara or Sofia, if you are willing to drive/take a bus to get there. 


And book with airlines directly, if you book with someone else, you may have trouble if any delay or cancellation happens. Or if you want to change something. Usually it's not worth a bit you may save with them.


Many super cheap flights are also just gone, it was much cheaper to fly pre pandemic, especially within Europe. No more under 20€ one way flights (within Europe, just hand luggage).",2025-04-09 07:01:46,6,Ivien,travel

If you travel outside of Europe, look up flights on momondo. Look where the stopover is. Sometimes it make sense to book directly to that stopover first, stay a bit and than travel to your final destinations.

mm7pmvn,1jur5gi,reddit,"google flights lets you compare flights from multiple origins to multiple destinations (so you can find flights from Skopje, Nis and Belgrade to London for example, finding the cheapest flight and which city it’s from in the results). 

I’ll be honest, Skyscanner is fairly garbage imo when it comes to comparing dates for travel i don’t know why people keep recommending it lol. I generally just end up using multiple tabs of google flights to try and build an itinerary. Find the cities you want and book it yourself. Other than layovers with a single carrier I advise against trying to get this all done in one booking, especially if it’s with LCC/ULCC in Europe. Also as it’s one of your first trips, maybe try to keep it simple for now with a single destination on a short period so you can start getting experience and used to things. 

Usually i book a round trip to a destination, or maybe an open jaw (fly into City A, fly home from City D) whilst making seperate one way bookings for flights from City A to City B, City B to City C (or sometimes I can get a nice long layover included for City A to City C via City B) and then a final booking for City C to City D. Often within Europe I can just book multiple one ways with LCC as the round trip isn’t actually cheaper unless you’re with a Full Service airline. 


I’ll include an upcoming example: 

I’ll be going to Latvia and Estonia this summer. 

I booked a one way from London to Tallinn for £45.

I made a seperate one way booking from Tallinn to Riga for £15

Then one more final booking from Riga to London for £24.

mloluzk,1js9539,reddit,"Many times when I visit a country I like to choose a historical character from the place and follow their footsteps. Usually I read a biography first to learn about them and their time period.

In Japan, I've visited many places from Matsuo Bashô's northern trip and read haikus at the place where he wrote them. In Berlin, I stayed at the spot where Humboldt lived and did Humboldt sightseeing around the city. In Venice I followed Vivaldi. Uzbekistan, Amir Timur and Ulug Bek. In Poland, Copernicus.

I try to be thorough and recreate their life where possible. For example, with Matsuo Basho, I visited Tohoku during June, which is the month he was there, so I could hear the cicadas in the rocks at Yamadera like he describes. With Copernicus, I visited the house where he grew up (it's a good historical museum now) and took an old boat up the Vistula river (he took a boat when going to university) and went star gazing. In Venice, I listened to a concert in the orphanage/church where Vivaldi composed most of his works and where they were performed for the first time.

I like to take my time and just stand in a place, try to imagine what it was like. What they heard, saw, thought. I focus on a specific character because it's easier for me to learn and focus on one person and their surroundings to recreate a point in time.

I've seen orchestral performances of movies scores there and it has been a wonderful experience. The Rodin, Barnes Foundation and Philadelphia Museum of Art are all lovely and while the Rodin is always pay-what-you-wish with free gardens, you can look into options to do so at the other museums on occasions like the first Sunday of every month or Friday night hours at the main art museum.

ml09k8g,1jpkua3,reddit,"Coming from Croatia and having lived in western Europe for a few years now, a note about the weather: in coastal Croatia it's common to have nice sunny days throughout the year but when it's raining it comes down pouring, whereas in the west I get a feeling there's weeks of gray skies and light drizzles. So maybe you'll have some days where you'll just have to spend time inside but it will pass quickly so the best plan is to be open for change of plans. On the coast a lot of restaurants close down so you'll have limited choice, and the winter ferry lines are more sparse. Buses between bigger cities are running frequently enough that it shouldn't be a problem. Most of the attractions are outdoors, it's more about the vibe of the cities really which is obviously nicer when it's sunny. I think the museums should still be open but they aren't huge so you can't just kill a whole day inside. Zagreb is definitely more lively during that time so you might want to spend some time there after Slovenia rather than going directly to the south. I would say that visiting in October would actually be more fitting for an authentic Balkan trip experience because you would be more likely to meet a local at a bar and start a conversation with them rather than just being surrounded by tourists (though I am still surprised when I come home for Christmas and I still hear tourists in my hometown).",2025-04-02 11:32:21,6,authenticallyaverage,travel

I’ve traveled solo, used tour operators, etc.  in Kenya and I’m returning this year, probably August. Want to go cheap, you can do cheap there. Get to Nairobi, and stay in a tent camp out in Karen suburbs. 
First the parks, they are remote, you have to get there. Public transport via matatu from Nairobi will get you close if you want the fabulous Mara region. Or by bus, all from the CBD area. But you will need transport to wherever you stay. Talek Gate area has some really cheap camping options. Then the parks, they are huge, the only way to see them is by booking a Safari and you can do that there in camp. You will be paying in cash. ATMs in town. 

Here is how you can do it. Take matatu from Nairobi to Narok. Ride ends in the big busy transport center. Tell your driver what you want he can advise you. anyway just check around the many travel offices there. Or walk across the street to the supermarket. See those guys all standing around, they are drivers. It is a long drive down to the reserve yet, but this will get you there cheap.

I also think you have way too much city/urban sightseeing and no nature or rural exploration. If that's all you want then that's fine, but I think you run the risk of doing the European equivalent of getting ""templed out"".

I think you have barely enough days for this trip.....but you going to have to redistribute days from Barcelona to some other cities.  Might get burnt out moving around so often, this is a long trip with a lot of stops.

How I would change it.....

* Substitute Ghent for Brussels.  Brussels is not that bad, I have been there a few times but Ghent and Bruges are so much better

* gotta add a day to Amsterdam, Prague, Florence(although you have been here before) and a few on your list between Budapest and Marseilles.  You are doing too much, you are moving at least every other day for over 2 weeks in section.  Slow down and enjoy Europe.  I would take a good 6 days from Barcelona for this(since you have been there).

* I would take 4 days from Barcelona and add a stop or two between AMS and Munich....tons of options, but that is a long train ride

* If you have a rail trip over 4-5 hours, I always consider adding in a stop for a day or two, or cut the city out and save it for another time.

I would honestly skip Monaco altogether, but if you really must visit, I absolutely wouldn't spend the night there. Similarly I would not spend the night in Nice. For this area, consider places like Menton, Villefranche-sur-Mer, Èze, or Saint-Paul-de-Vence. These towns are just so much nicer and more authentic, and then from these places you can go visit Nice/Monaco as long as you see fit - they're all well connected by train.

In the same vein, Toulon and Marseille are not worth staying in (personally). Especially Toulon. What a dump. Instead stay in Cassis or Aix-en-Provence and then visit Marseille. Lyon is absolutely fantastic and well worth a longer stay, but consider perhaps 1 night in Annecy or at least a day trip there. Also for your stay in Paris, I know you haven't much time otherwise I'd have recommended doing a day trip to either Provins, Rouen, or Strasbourg since it seems you don't have any medieval French cities in your itinerary.

Also, as a final note: please for the love of god just skip Brussels altogether. It's such a grungy whatever city and most Europeans would tell you the same.

They are absolutely magical at night and there are few prettier places that walking along the old Roman Bridge in Cordoba as the sun sets or seeing the Alhambra lit up at night.

Having said that, Spain has one of the best train systems around and it's very easy to get to the various cities in Andalusia out of Seville. Both Cordoba and Granada are under three hours away via train. And given that driving in the historical city centers is a nightmare, I would recommend sticking with trains and then getting around the city either by mass transit or taxis/Uber.",2025-04-01 14:55:12,5,Desperate_Truth_7029,travel
mkvi8mt,1jowrpz,reddit,"Did a similar trip two years ago and can share some insight. 

Seville is the best place to stay for your plan. It has the most direct train lines to all the cities you listed. I also argue it has the most to see and do outside of Granada. 

Granada itself should be at least 2-3 days to visit. It's an amazing city. Alhambra alone can take 8-10 hours to see everything (but you **must** book tickets in advance). Please don't make the mistake of making Granada a day trip. You won't regret it.

Cordoba, for me, is worth a day trip but not an overnight stay. The Cathedral-Mosque is the highlight of the visit. Also take an hour or two to walk through the nearby neighborhoods and see their famous patios. 

We rented a car but regretted it and returned it early. Spain's public transportation is well-developed and reliable. If you're an American, the narrow streets and mopeds may give you anxiety when driving. Unless you want to see some smaller towns like Setenil de las Bodegas, skip the car.

If you do end up staying in Malaga, I absolutely recommend taking a morning bus to Gibraltar. Takes about 90 minutes each way, so you can visit the Rock and see the town in a day. One of the coolest places I've ever visited.",2025-04-01 16:03:52,4,ScarsAndStripes,travel

ml2ykbv,1jonsbh,reddit,"So… getting to see the northern lights properly requires a bit of knowledge as to the prime conditions more than location. Think of it as akin to Tornado Hunting. If you’ve ever watched any show documenting storm chasers, you’ll understand how important conditions are…

Essentially you’re chasing three important conditions:

1.) Solar Activity
2.) Sky Cover (Clouds)
3. Bortle Scale (how dark the Sky is)

Alaska Fairbanks University has a website that forecasts Solar Activity. They describe the activity using a scale: KP. 

[Aurora Forecast](https://www.gi.alaska.edu/monitors/aurora-forecast)

KP 1 - 9. 1 being “very low activity”, 9 being “holy shit turn your electronics off solar storm.”

Anything KP 6+ is worth your time. 

As with any forecast, things change as we get closer to the event. So even a great forecast can turn out to be a dud.

The key is to align great forecasts with minimum sky cover (30% or less) at a dependable dark site.

[Light Pollution](https://www.lightpollutionmap.info/#zoom=10.78&lat=47.8964&lon=-90.0268&state=eyJiYXNlbWFwIjoiTGF5ZXJCaW5nUm9hZCIsIm92ZXJsYXkiOiJ3YV8yMDE1Iiwib3ZlcmxheWNvbG9yIjpmYWxzZSwib3ZlcmxheW9wYWNpdHkiOiI2MCIsImZlYXR1cmVzb3BhY2l0eSI6Ijg1In0=)

I live in Minnesota, and I have three dark sites that I monitor for cloud cover on nights that are forecasted to be high activity.

You can monitor cloud cover on your phone of course, or you can use NOAA. I’ve found the latter to be more reliable.

[NOAA](https://digital.weather.gov/)

I would recommend finding a handful of sites you can reasonably access within two or three hours drive.


I say all this because I, too, have been tempted to travel to places like Reykjavik to see the lights. But regardless of how much you pay out how far you go, if conditions aren’t optimal, you won’t be successful.

Some minor comments:

Shibuya is right next to Harajuku and Yoyogi. Like 5 minutes walk. So I'd change your evening sightseeing around: 

- day 2 - 9 may: Tokyo - Senso-Ji and Sumida River + Skytree, **visit Tokyo tower**

- day 4 - 11 may: Tokyo - Meiji Jingu shrine, Yoyogi park, Harajuku, **evening in Shibuya**

As for the day trips, I don't think you have too many. Day trips are great and help you get to know different sides of the country. Uji might be more of a half day, it's probably the least interesting of the ones on your list. But if you like tea, maybe start early and go out to Wazuka tea fields, then some of Uji on your way back up in the afternoon.

I would heavily recommend the yokochos in various neighborhoods, which are frenetic gatherings of bars that also can seem quite intimate, especially those in Ebisu and Shenganjaya. 


Also, I think you're giving Kanazawa short shrift. It's amazing. Medium city, phenomenal food, and a walkable core. Be forewarned though that the samurai district/geisha districts you could literally see in 15 minutes. Build a day around the river walk, canals and bakeries, and omicha market instead. 


You'll have an amazing time.
