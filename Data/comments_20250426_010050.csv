1) Building a factory takes years and a lot of money. Who knows what’s going to happen in 4 years. Maybe the tariff stays, maybe it goes away.

2) manufacturing products still require sourcing parts and materials from outside the country. So the tariff still gets passed on.

mlgwjgy,1jr93uh,reddit,"Sauce: I work for an American manufacturing company in Canada.  

""Spinning up"" a new manufacturing plant is a decidedly non-trivial endeavour that cost tens to hundreds of millions of dollars. It takes 5+ years to get producing.  And that's assuming you've got an available *trained* labour base.   Typically speaking workers are a net *disadvantage* to the company for upwards of a year while they build their skillsets, because mistakes and failures are *extremely* expensive in terms of broken equipment and failed manufacturing runs.  

Those workers don't exist.  The machines they'll operate likely don't exist and will themselves have to be manufactured themselves to order.  

While long term futures I won't guess at, for Trump's term there will be no appreciable increase in manufacturing.  It *can't* happen that fast, even putting side the myriad of reasons why it won't.  Not least of which: why invest that money in making an uncompetitive manufacturing company that will go bankrupt the moment a new administration axes tariffs.

mlcrj2m,1jr93uh,reddit,"From the article: If you were wondering how President Trump’s tariffs may impact gadgets like smartphones, laptops, and smartwatches, there’s some bad, and perhaps slightly less-bad news. Unless something changes, Trump’s sweeping tariffs will lead to increased prices for consumers. But it will likely take some time before that actually happens.

Modern gadgets generally aren’t made or assembled solely in the U.S. anymore. Device makers big and small source components from all over the world, and often have them assembled overseas before importing the final product into the country. Given that Trump has levied tariffs on every single country, it means that the cost to make all our devices will inevitably go up.

“The biggest thing right now is going to be the inflationary impact,” says Jason Miller, professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University. “If they stay in place for several months, we’ll start to see those effects by mid-summer and certainly back-to-school season.”

Miller notes goods shipped from China to the U.S. will face a whopping 54 percent tariffs, including most gadgets. Vietnam, where Apple has shifted some of its manufacturing, also has a high tariff rate at 46 percent.

“If [companies] absorb the extra cost and don’t pass it on, their profits are going to plunge and their capital investment will drop,” says Miller. “Or, they’ll pass a good share of it onto the downstream buyer, which in many instances is the consumer.”

Barring any new exemptions or changes, you can expect every single device category to be negatively impacted, says Ryan Reith, group vice president of worldwide device trackers at IDC. But devices will be impacted differently. Smartphones, says Reith, have more wiggle room than TVs or PCs as they have a “well-established monthly hardware payment dependence.”

Miller agrees, noting that it’s not likely that a smartphone will suddenly be 50 percent more expensive. A more reasonable expectation would be a roughly 20 percent bump.",2025-04-04 10:59:44,9,chrisdh79,gadgets

mlgcmae,1jr93uh,reddit,"Let's shut down almost all of our brains and pretend for just one moment that Trump WILL bring manufacturing back to the US.

Already, we're fighting reality, because he has [come out in opposition to the CHIPS Act,](https://www.reuters.com/technology/trump-wants-kill-527-billion-semiconductor-chips-subsidy-law-2025-03-05/) a bipartisan bill that is perhaps the most important piece of business legislation signed in the last 20+ years, designed to get more chip manufacturing back in the US. He did that almost certainly for no better reason than it was Biden who signed it.

But OK, we're pretending. So if American industry started **right this moment** to rebuild US manufacturing, it would take *at least* 2-3 years and an initial outlay of tens--maybe hundreds--of billions to get to the point where goods START to come off the line. You need to buy land, build or renovate factories, buy or design equipment, hire workers all across the spectrum from unskilled to expert, plus management. That takes time. Gee, it sure is a good thing that all these companies who will have to do that are in real good shape, with their stocks all robust and....oh. Wait...

His [feigned opposition to foreign goods](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/thousands-of-trump-bibles-were-printed-in-china-as-he-campaigned-against-trade-practices)

ml0qsay,1jpolgt,reddit,"From the article: Nintendo has finally shared many of the key specs about the Nintendo Switch 2 as part of its Switch 2-focused Direct. The system launches on June 5th.

The device has a 7.9-inch screen, but it’s still 13.99mm thick, like the first Switch. The LCD screen has a 1080p resolution, and supports HDR and up to a 120fps refresh rate.

The Joy-Con controllers are bigger, too, and as hinted at, they can be used similarly to a mouse. (Though a footnote says that mouse mode will only work with compatible games.) And they stay connected to the Switch 2 via magnets.

It has 256GB of internal storage, up from 32GB on the first Switch. As shown in the Switch 2’s initial reveal trailer, it also has two USB-C ports for connecting accessories and for charging.

When using the dock, you can play games at up to 4K resolution at 60fps. The dock also has a fan to keep the system cool.

The new C button can also be used to activate a chat menu that lets you access controls like muting your voice during the Discord-like “GameChat” calls.

To help users better understand the features of the Switch 2, Nintendo will also be releasing a Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour paid digital game that will be available on launch day.

The game cards for the Switch 2 will be red, a change from the black cards for the original Switch. The system also supports MicroSD Express cards, but original MicroSD cards for the Switch are not compatible.",2025-04-02 13:31:27,873,chrisdh79,gadgets

mo9go5v,1k4f004,reddit,"From the article: As I reported just last week, cheap-yet-awesome retro handhelds are being marched to the guillotine in the name of Trump tariffs. One of the first companies to have its head on the block is also one of the most prolific. Handheld maker Anbernic told customers Sunday that it would stop all direct shipments to U.S. customers, at least until President Donny finally offers any clarity on how much people will pay in import duties for products from China.

Anbernic is known for its enormous library of handheld video game emulation hardware. These handhelds are able to use console emulators—essentially full video game consoles translated into software—to play new homebrew titles as well as digital copies of older games, known as ROMS. In a page describing the new shipping policy, Anbernic said “due to changes in U.S. tariff policies, we will be suspending all shipping from China to the United States starting today. We strongly recommend prioritizing products shipped from our U.S. warehouse.”

Until today Anbernic let customers ship products either directly from China or from it’s U.S. warehouse, where supplies were more limited but products would ship out faster. It’s unclear how long the current supply of consoles in the U.S. will last. I reached out to Anbernic for comment, but did not immediately hear back. The handheld maker said it would update customers when it received “confirmed updates regarding import duties.”

Fortunately there’s more than one way to get a console from Anbernic. You might still be able to find its products on Amazon, or AliExpress. The dropshipping site typically sells these handhelds for much cheaper than you could get elsewhere, too. The classic Anbernic RG35XX Plus Game Boy-like device goes for $48 on AliExpress, $50 on the Anbernic site, and a whopping $80 on Amazon.

So I was watching a depression food recipe YouTube and they were talking about Hoover stew. This is my new hobby.. Watching depression era cooking on YouTube.
Anyway one of the featured recipes was called Hoover stew. It was called this because 
 Hoover was widely blamed for the 1930s economic depression. Further research lead me to something called the smoot Hawley tariff act. I didn't know anything about this so it was interesting to learn about and it is easy to see how it is applicable here. 
Except in Hoover's case I don't think he was trying to purposefully bankrupt the American people to hand over the country to the tech bros.. in trump's case he seems to be doing it to ""show"" he's protecting American interests but I'm reality it was already good and now it's garbage. Anyway.. Here is a brief summary of the act.

The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, officially the Tariff Act of 1930, was a U.S. law enacted on June 17, 1930, that significantly raised import duties on over 20,000 foreign goods. It was championed by Senator Reed Smoot and Representative Willis C. Hawley, with the primary goal of protecting American farmers and industries from foreign competition during the onset of the Great Depression.
Here are the key facts about the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act:
 * Protectionist Measure: Its main aim was to shield domestic producers by making imported goods more expensive.
 * High Tariff Rates: The act increased tariffs to some of the highest levels in U.S. history, averaging around a 20% increase on dutiable imports. Some tariffs were raised as high as 50%.
 * Wide Scope: It applied to a vast range of goods, both agricultural and manufactured.
 * Triggered Retaliation: A major consequence was that many foreign countries retaliated by imposing their own tariffs on American exports.
 * Contributed to Trade Decline: This trade war led to a dramatic decline in international trade. U.S. exports and imports both plummeted by significant amounts. Global trade decreased by an estimated 65% between 1929 and 1934.
 * Worsened the Great Depression: While the Act didn't cause the Great Depression, most economists agree that it significantly worsened its severity and prolonged the economic downturn both in the U.S. and globally. It reduced demand for goods, led to business closures, and exacerbated unemployment.
 * Nearly Unanimous Opposition from Economists: Over 1,000 economists signed a petition urging President Hoover to veto the bill, warning of its negative economic consequences.
 * Political Motivations: Despite the economic warnings, political pressure from various domestic industries seeking protection led to its passage.
 * A Symbol of Protectionism: The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act has become a lasting symbol of the dangers of protectionist trade policies and is often cited as an example of how tariffs can backfire.
 * Shift Towards Free Trade: In the years following the Great Depression, the U.S. shifted towards policies of trade liberalization, beginning with the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934.
In essence, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 was a protectionist measure intended to help American industries but ultimately contributed to a global trade war and deepened the economic crisis of the Great Depression.",2025-04-21 15:51:49,28,J-W-L,gadgets

So I was watching a depression food recipe YouTube and they were talking about Hoover stew. This is my new hobby.. Watching depression era cooking on YouTube.
Anyway one of the featured recipes was called Hoover stew. It was called this because 
 Hoover was widely blamed for the 1930s economic depression. Further research lead me to something called the smoot Hawley tariff act. I didn't know anything about this so it was interesting to learn about and it is easy to see how it is applicable here. 
Except in Hoover's case I don't think he was trying to purposefully bankrupt the American people to hand over the country to the tech bros.. in trump's case he seems to be doing it to ""show"" he's protecting American interests but I'm reality it was already good and now it's garbage. Anyway.. Here is a brief summary of the act.

The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, officially the Tariff Act of 1930, was a U.S. law enacted on June 17, 1930, that significantly raised import duties on over 20,000 foreign goods. It was championed by Senator Reed Smoot and Representative Willis C. Hawley, with the primary goal of protecting American farmers and industries from foreign competition during the onset of the Great Depression.
Here are the key facts about the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act:
 * Protectionist Measure: Its main aim was to shield domestic producers by making imported goods more expensive.
 * High Tariff Rates: The act increased tariffs to some of the highest levels in U.S. history, averaging around a 20% increase on dutiable imports. Some tariffs were raised as high as 50%.
 * Wide Scope: It applied to a vast range of goods, both agricultural and manufactured.
 * Triggered Retaliation: A major consequence was that many foreign countries retaliated by imposing their own tariffs on American exports.
 * Contributed to Trade Decline: This trade war led to a dramatic decline in international trade. U.S. exports and imports both plummeted by significant amounts. Global trade decreased by an estimated 65% between 1929 and 1934.
 * Worsened the Great Depression: While the Act didn't cause the Great Depression, most economists agree that it significantly worsened its severity and prolonged the economic downturn both in the U.S. and globally. It reduced demand for goods, led to business closures, and exacerbated unemployment.
 * Nearly Unanimous Opposition from Economists: Over 1,000 economists signed a petition urging President Hoover to veto the bill, warning of its negative economic consequences.
 * Political Motivations: Despite the economic warnings, political pressure from various domestic industries seeking protection led to its passage.
 * A Symbol of Protectionism: The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act has become a lasting symbol of the dangers of protectionist trade policies and is often cited as an example of how tariffs can backfire.
 * Shift Towards Free Trade: In the years following the Great Depression, the U.S. shifted towards policies of trade liberalization, beginning with the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934.
In essence, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 was a protectionist measure intended to help American industries but ultimately contributed to a global trade war and deepened the economic crisis of the Great Depression.",2025-04-21 15:52:22,-17,J-W-L,gadgets

Switch 1 sold about 330,000 in Japan the first weekend and about 500,000 the first month.

So 2.2 million pre-orders for the followup is quite a boost.

Now, on the other side though, people were a bit skeptical about the Switch when it was first announced. So initial orders may have been a little slow, but it really caught on once people started trying it out. Switch being a known quantity and very popular they *should* have been expecting a better out of the gate response with their estimates this time.

Also, Nintendo being Nintendo, was that 500,000 in the first month bavknin 2017 all they could move or was that all that was available? I don't know for sure which.

You've seen this with Strava, too, who has had a sub model for forever and dealt with the ""problem"" by restricting their API last year.  This effected everything from intervals.icu to Runalyze to Sauce for Strava to Elevate for Strava, and many more.

It's natural that Garmin -- as the *source* of the majority of this data -- would want to be in the game themselves.  I would have hoped, as long time Garmin customer (I believe my second watch was a Forerunner 620, and I no longer remember what it replaced), that they'd just invest in improvements to Connect, but although they *did* complete their wholesale Connect revamping last year, they didn't actually make *any* improvements on the data analysis front.  That was a huge miss.  Athletes care far less about UI/UX (see Golden Cheetah or WKO for example!) than about insights, and by locking future functionality behind a paywall, Garmin is going to miss out on more than they gain.

Remember the 240 watt limit on USB-C is only for 48v output. I believe if you're sending 12v, it's limited to 60 watts. To go above that, your device probably needs a DC-to-DC converter, which is adds costs and reduces efficiency.

mmrrv6o,1jxdm2z,reddit,"There is an argument that at smaller sizes 4K TV sets already don’t make sense for the average use case. Admittedly now that 65” has become the de facto standard TV size and larger 70-80” TVs aren’t as unattainable the argument is kind of outdated, but for a TV of like 50-55” at a viewing distance of 10 feet or more it’s not just overkill, the human retina isn’t capable of resolving that much detail.

Honestly I think the only reason 4K became as ubiquitous as it is was because of marketing and buzzwords, along with the fact that at the electronics store you tend to get much closer to the TVs than you would at home, so the difference between the two would have been much more impressive and impactful than it would in a mundane home setting. It’s not like the average person had a *need* for a 4KTV, and in many normal use cases it would be downright impossible for them to really see a difference.

8K therefore only makes sense for supersized TVs or home theater systems. At sizes of like 120” (depending of course on viewing distance) then yes, 8K would be a visible improvement, there is still room to push sharpness further. But how many of us have that setup, or even have room for that kind of setup if the TVs didn’t cost as much as a used car? It’s an extremely niche thing that will likely remain that way for a long time.

That’s not to say 8K will never see widespread use, for example when it comes to computer monitors since we sit so close to them 8K would be a noticeable improvement over 4K for very large monitors (larger than the average person uses but the size s enthusiasts and professionals often use). And for that reason I don’t really have a problem with 8K *content* existing, though there’s really no market for it yet and it doesn’t make sense to try and rush it. But for normal sized home setups, outside of some niche cases, 8K doesn’t really offer any advantage and the increase in resolution over 4K is largely wasted.",2025-04-12 18:14:22,1,obi1kenobi1,gadgets

mmvprca,1jxdm2z,reddit,"8K adoption is going to be so slow. Most people have just moved up to 4K + for a lot of them. They didn't notice a whole difference over their 1080P. A lot of people don't buy the high-end TVs. 8K is going to be for the enthusiasts for a long time. When everyone has a hundred to 150 in TV in their house and they sell them at $1,000 or less which might not be far off. Then you're going to maybe see some 8K come into the picture. The reason why. Well they'll have nothing else to upgrade. 

However 

True 8K probably is really far off because of the compression. Sending that data is not going to be easy and is not going to be cheap and everyone is going to need a really good fiber line.

""The 2024 Synology models and older are not affected by this change. Still, those upgrading to or purchasing the latest Plus Series device, set to be released this year, will have to buy their drives directly from Synology or its certified suppliers to maximize their system. Because of this, you won’t be able to pick from the best hard drives if you get Synology’s latest Plus Series NAS Systems.""

The company told ComputerBase [machine translated] that it made using Synology-branded and Synology-certified drives compulsory because of the success it saw with its high-performance NAS systems, and that users of the upcoming Plus Series models would “benefit from higher performance, increased reliability, and more efficient support.” Furthermore, Seagate, one of the bigger manufacturers in the storage industry, has recently been rocked by a fraudulent HDD scandal that affected its NAS drives.

In response I've had one person start slinging insults and tons of people questioning the exact data which does NOT exist yet. It's basic logic if magnets in that spot mess with my hall effect joycons then it'll mess with the switch 2 if it had hall effect.

Guess what I just tested. That's right. It drags my character to the right when I put a magnet on the side of the switch where the connectors on the switch 2 are.

mnuyee8,1k2k1eq,reddit,"RAID: Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks.

The whole point of RAID is that it is resilient to drive failure, allowing you to spend less on disks (if you so choose).

If I can simultaneously increase the reliability of a service while lowering the cost, I do it. That's the main benefit of aggregating less reliable systems. That kind of outcome where I work would land me a fat bonus.

Saying that the reliability of the disks is important is complete bullshit. You can solve the reliability problem entirely in software with RAID.

mkuiexa,1jounzt,reddit,"From the article: AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D remains an incredibly popular CPU, especially among gamers. But it seems not every buyer is having a good experience. There have been over 100 cases of owners whose chips have died after working for a short amount of time, and for no obvious reason.

Reddit user natty_overlord compiled a [list](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASRock/comments/1i5iy9a/update_and_summary_on_the_dead_9800x3ds/) of all 108 Reddit posts involving a Ryzen 7 9800X3D that died. The chips passed POST and worked for varying amounts of time before dying with no signs of failure.

What's interesting is the brand of motherboard these failures occurred on. 98 of the cases, or 82%, happened on Asrock boards, though that could be due to their popularity as a more budget-friendly board maker. Tom's Hardware notes that the company released a new firmware update for AM5 motherboards in February that improved boot problems in AMD 9000 series CPUs. Whether those issues are related to the dying chips is unclear.",2025-04-01 12:45:09,164,chrisdh79,gadgets

mkht77v,1jlzead,reddit,"One day, I hope, people will realize that even if the mobile chips were clocked as high as they could go, and even if they didn't throttle - that the performance you'd get out of it would at best match a desktop setup set to about 120W max.

And that as it is now, when you can get 3d and CPU performance above the level required for 1080p@60fps inside 30 Watt, the dgpu design is completely pointless.

Because: you could, right now, put an almost ten year old gpu in a usb4 dock, and objectively beat the performance of any of these ""gaming"" laptops, even if you plugged the dock into a 30W max sliver of a laptop. Which would, with some tweaking, put you on a 150W budget with an old 2070rtx, for example. 

And then basically beat the tdp budget of a razer, as well as get more performance out of it for games. It would be as mobile, and it would be a laptop that wouldn't weigh a ton when you're not gaming. Etc, etc.

We could have that right now. But the industry wants to sell underclocked Intel chips with new rtx chipsets for 4k dollars. So that's what we're all reviewing. And sadly, it's what people genuinely think is reasonable to expect will be where the best performance is.

The music industry was already being devastated by the time Steam came round. I can’t believe a marketing exec in the software and entertainment industry needed a “wow the piracy thing might impact sales” in 2003. Also Microsoft had moved to requiring online/phone activation for windows xp and office 2 years before Steam and she worked as an exec at Microsoft so she surely was aware of the somewhat universal acceptance by that organization that online activation was the solution and would be tolerated by users.

It inspired not the Steam DRM, but the cd-key used on the original release of Half-Life, years before Steam even launched. Obviously, the impact of CD burners and piracy were widespread by 2003, so the anecdote doesn't quite make sense in that context. But they were much more novel in the 90s:

>In the final weeks of Half-Life’s development, Mike was working furiously on some of the game’s final code. For Mike and Monica, it was stressful and tense because they knew exactly what was at stake. The rest of the team had mostly finished their work. Finally, in November, the game went to duplication and they had a ship party where Mike broke open a pinata filled with candy to everyone’s cheers. After that day, it was eerily quiet, almost like purgatory. In those days, it still took a while to get boxes out to retail and start getting feedback on how the game was actually selling.

>At the time, consumer-level piracy was just becoming a real issue. Monica’s nephew had just used a $500 check she had sent him for school expenses to buy a CD replicator, and being the nice guy he was, he sent a her a lovely thank you note saying how happy he was to be able to copy and share games with his friends.

>“I knew he wasn’t a bad kid – he just saw the world differently – a generational change, combined with new technology put our entire business model at risk,” Monica said.

>Because of gamers like Monica’s nephew, Valve implemented an authentication scheme where customers had to validate and register their copy with Valve directly. Soon, gamers were flooding the message boards saying that the game didn’t work. It was enormously stressful. For a few days, Mike called everyone he could find who complained about the authentication – and NONE of them had actually bought the game. Which meant the authentication system was working extremely well. It felt like a near-death experience.

>Then, in early December, as game industry reviews started coming in, the Wall St. Journal article appeared with the title “Valve’s Storytelling Game is a Hit.”",2025-03-27 01:29:31,5,TheOvy,gadgets

If that ends up being true then 256 GB isn’t going to last long even if the average file size only increases to 30 GB (space for about 8 games after space for OS is reserved).

EDIT: I know services like GOG exist that offer DRM-free local ownership. I'll concede that's different and a good way to preserve games. That's not what I'm talking about though considering the majority of PC gaming happens through store services like ORIGIN and Steam.

and yes i know if you modify your console you can just use it to rip/dump the games or even just copy the downloaded games to a USB drive, but right now there is no software or hardware mod or exploit for the switch2 (so far).

moxgi1b,1k73140,reddit,"When PC games started doing this BS I was immediately pissed. I am not buying an empty game case just to input a code into steam to have a digital game. If I wanted a digital game I would have bought it digitally instead of wasting money on an empty box that's basically just a waste of materials. 

Though this is kinda the worst of both worlds. You have to have this physical thing, but you still have to rely on the servers being available to download said game. So when Nintendo inevitably shuts down said servers this ""game-key"" is worthless ewaste. Thanks for contributing to more ewaste Nintendo you pieces of crap. 

I basically got forced into going only digital these days for games since it's very difficult to find cheaper physical games, and most of the time it requires you to use steam for most PC games. I prefer GOG these days since I don't have to deal with DRM or worrying about losing access to my game if I lose my steam account, it gets banned, or hacked etc. On GOG I can download the game and play it offline whenever.",2025-04-25 06:39:23,1,iamfuturetrunks,gadgets

_**You can fit multiple terabytes of data in a space the size of your pinky nail.**_ The ""cartridges"", or more realistically plastic holders of access keys, are to gatekeep game ownership and to remove private consumer ownership of IP. This has been an ongoing trend since the 360 era and the birth of digital downloads. Manufacturers, not the developer, want to cut COST, hence the complete dissolution of physical games. It also gets games to market faster (yay unfinished games!) which is a partial upside I suppose.



Nintendo is fairly dead to me now, but WE as consumers vote with our wallets.

mjtxr0s,1jka3pc,reddit,"As a P1S owner, I'm going to effectively re-post here  with some more comments what I posted in the OpenBambu sub:

Honestly, this thing really tells me how out of touch Bambu is and how much they are not listening to their user base, it feels like a cash scramble as they slowly lose their market positioning.

The x1c was great at the time but priced at nearly double the P1S it's really only there for legacy farm compatibility. It's no longer a value leader. They should put the board, touchscreen, and chamber sensor on the P1S with native 90w heater and sell it for $899 as a P1S turbo and retire the X1C. With the addition of the chamber heater in the H2D it's really displacing the X1E but those are pretty rare in the wild.

The H2D feels like they are SKU forcing a step up from the X1C to get that profit spread but it really does not bring enough to the table for the pricing. 

Now we have the Prusa one as the premium option and QIDI is really breathing down their door. You expect to pay more for a Bambu, sure, but everyone else is launching their own multimaterial options in the next year and they look pretty good. That means there is going to be a lot of competition.

It feels like an awkward SKU. The kind of people who are tinkerers who would swap in and out a laser head here are small scale etsy sellers and home users - the kind of people who are not paying nearly 2 grand for a machine like this BASE and $3500 with all the options.

If they wanted to be a market disruptor they needed to do this for $500 less than the base price, minimum, with the laser head. Bambu is stuck in their own past and it will be the boat anchor that sinks them from relevance.

I can't imagine giving them $3500 for anything as a consumer or any space with the developer mode and firmware stunts this year.

They also locked this printer down for the new options, laser does not work outside of their closed system, you're locked in.

While the machine is pretty cool it's WILDLY out of it's target audience pricing there. People are not spending $3500 for a hobbyist targeted cricut and... pen plotter. 

Granted it's a cool machine and has a lot of neat small features, but, why would I pay triple the price of a p1s for this for idex, more watts, and an optional laser head? 
If I wanted a 10w laser, Creality has one for $338. I could get a P1S, AMS, and a laser for 1/3rd the price. It's convenient and slick as an AIO, but, is it slick enough for an upcharge of thousands over the rapidly evolving competition?",2025-03-26 13:39:22,19,tastyratz,gadgets

Now that you can use a 40in TV as a monitor (due to 120+hz support) I can both game and work on that screen.  4k resolution at 40in is like having 4 1080p 20in monitors.  So much room for productivity during the day. 

The only problem with a 40in monitor are the edges, the corners are pretty far away, so this is a model where a curved screen would be great, because you're sitting right in front of it.

I bought the lg 40in 4k oled model a couple of years back, I love it. It was $1000 on Amazon and have zero problems. The only upgrade I'm looking for is for it to be curved  =/

Also I personally don’t feel this feature warrants a premium over without it since you do have it connected to a computer most likely, and usually the built in modules are as cheap as they can get away with.

moieta5,1k53wd7,reddit,"Smart TV's were a great idea until advertising absolutely everywhere became popular. I got a TCL Roku TV about 7 years ago and noticed a huge increase in ads during COVID. Enough of them that it prompted me to factory reset the TV and only use it as another monitor and connection to my stereo. Every update brought more ads that slowed it down more. Ads for the background, ads on the right side, ads at the bottom, briefly even pop-up ads when I turned it on. I have a theory that smart TV's prompted streaming services to seek ad revenue because they knew the only way around ads would be special ad-free memberships. 7 years later, there's ads everywhere and the ""correct"" way to bypass is membership for fewer ads. YouTube even has ads if you pay for the ""ad-free membership"" now.

If LG can promise NO ADS in the UI, seems like a good idea. But because I'm about 99.99% certain that's not gonna happen, seems like a bad idea.",2025-04-22 22:30:17,1,x10011010001x,gadgets

It's really hard to say how many cards need to be binned because they have failures & how many need to be binned just to meet market demand. I wouldn't assume that any 9070 you buy will be stable flashed as a 9070xt, but I suspect most every 9070 has some disabled cores that are functional.

Hopefully AMD doesn't disable the feature for consumers, it's bad for business if Dell & OEM can get more than they paid for (and make the cards appear less reliable in the process), but if a consumer with a bit of knowledge and skill can squeeze out a bit extra it may well be worth the good will.

You just have to gate the process behind some technical skill which leaves a record to prevent warranty abuse. An easily cuttable lead or resistor would do it.
