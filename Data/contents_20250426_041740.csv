1ju79lu,reddit,"WTF?!?!?!! BoywithUke actively insulted San Francisco, the Warfield, and the fans who showed up to see him tonight - Musicians who do this should lose bookings","Last minute I decided to go to the Warfield tonight to see a show. I didn't know much about BoywithUke, but some of his songs sounded like a bop and I love the Warfield, so I thought ""Why not?""

Gosh, do I wish I had stayed home and not given a dime to this tour. Not only did he take the stage say he previously came to San Francisco to find himself but discovered that the city is disgusting and crime filled, he continued his rant about the location of the Warfield and how 60% of the crime is committed in the blocks around the Warfield. He literally asked the crowd, ""did you know that?""

This is on top of shushing a fan in the front row who was excited as he came on stage, he outright told a fan who said he was 10 who was near the front that when BoywithUke was 10 he was reserved and that the fan should be more like him.

At one point in the set he asked for gifts to be thrown on stage and then gleefully picking up a sweatshirt someone bought from merch and taking it backstage as he said ""that's an $80 mistake"" with a smile. He had the audacity to later announce that his favorite person on the tour is the person selling merch and sang some bullshit song that everyone should go buy his merch before walking off stage to a projection that literally said ""The End."" On top of all this, the majority of his set used prerecorded vocals so he basically lip synced the whole thing. This would be bad, but coupled with his total disrespect, it was the worst show I've ever seen in 15 years in SF.

I see nearly 200 shows a year across the country and have NEVER seen an artist happily insult the people and the place who are paying to put him on stage and give him a mic. It was an insulting waste of time and money.

Venues and labels need to pay attention to artists that do this by canceling contracts and not bringing them back. Being on stage is a privilege. Fans and cities are their lifeblood.

I, for one, will NEVER buy a ticket or a lineup which supports this completely ungrateful human and suggest more fans and would-be fans do the same.",2025-04-08 06:43:00,music,music,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,4135,758,,0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1ju79lu/wtf_boywithuke_actively_insulted_san_francisco/,PasstheGuacPleaae

And it’s a song with not just a chorus, but a legit pre-chorus. All three parts of the song are distinctive and sound great. There’s a melancholy to the story. Chappell tells the story in an amazingly open and grounded way, embracing the complicated-ness of the themes. 

I think it’s the best pop song of the last decade. I think it’s a legit great, impressive, catchy-as-all-hell song.

1k2b0hz,reddit,Where’s all the protest music in the 2020s?,"In the 1960s, music was a major part of the cultural conversation. Anti-war and anti-Nixon songs topped the charts. In the 1980s, huge artists like Springsteen, Mellencamp, and Billy Joel were openly singing about the struggles of the working class and the effects of globalization.

Now, in the 2020s, we've lived through a global pandemic, mass protests for racial justice, extreme political polarization, economic shifts like tariffs and inflation, etc., but where’s the music reflecting all that?

It feels like there's way less mainstream music engaging with these themes, or at least it's not getting the same attention. Has protest music gone underground? Are artists more hesitant to speak out? Has music's role in culture shifted?

Curious what others think. Is it just me not aware of this music, or has something changed?",2025-04-18 17:47:44,music,music,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,1107,972,,0.85,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1k2b0hz/wheres_all_the_protest_music_in_the_2020s/,Realtrain

1jpvfjj,reddit,Stories of Meeting a Musician You Thought Would Be Cool (Who Wasnt) and Vice Versa?,"Wondering if anyone has had this experience.

Lead singer of my fav industrial band (KMFDM) was an absolute insufferable prick to bar staff and the folks in line. Dude seems so cool and his music is all about self ownership and being a decent person. But the guy got kicked out of his own show because the bartender didn't have a beer waiting for him (front of house bar, not backstage or VIP).

On the flipside, the dude from Nickelback is absolutely chill and has a great sense of humor. I was DJing a strip club and customers had asked to hear Slayer, but they hadn't tipped the dancers yet, so I made an announcement, ""If we see dollars on the stage, next song is Slayer, if not, it's gonna be Nickelback."" This dude at the bar turns around and gives me a huge thumbs up while laughing. I thought it was a Slayer fan. Turns out it was Chad from Nickelback and he tipped the bartender $300 for just one beer, signed a credit card slip with his name on it (not a stage name btw). Also smiled and waved on the way out.

I don't want to like anything about Nickelback but now I do.

Anyone else have any ""didn't think they would be like that"" stories?",2025-04-02 18:07:52,music,music,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,881,911,,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1jpvfjj/stories_of_meeting_a_musician_you_thought_would/,djhazmatt503
1jy6phm,reddit,John Mayer the guitarist,"I’m a guitarist. I practice guitar multiple hours every day, multiple times a day. I’m not the greatest guitarist in the world, but I’m a student of it. And as a student, I look for teachers. I look at what the others who came before me did and said

John Mayer in the mainstream, particularly the past 20 years, is viewed as a pop sensation. I have never heard of such a technically gifted guitarist viewed in such a different light. 

He’s handsome. He’s pretentious. He complains a lot. But he is so frickin talented. On acoustic. On electric. In theory. In blues. Everything guitarists strive to be. Yet, some would slap you if you mentioned his name along others like Hendrix, SRV, Prince. 

I’ve listened to them all my entire life. I can play most of their songs. John Mayer is right up there. I feel like he will not get respected until he dies.

Some give him his credit. It’s just not popularly accepted at this point. His songs also served a different demographic for most of his career. But I don’t think that diminishes his technical ability. He also ventures into different genres. He did the guitar for most of Mac Miller’s later albums. He fills in for the Dead. That right there is crazy — to be so closely connected to two vastly different, yet adored, music scenes.

He also tries to teach the art of guitar, in his own pretentious way. He makes videos for beginners explaining his songs, how theory is involved in it, and how they can use that theory to create their own music. Not just replicate his. 

Just something I’ve been thinking about recently ",2025-04-13 12:39:00,music,music,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,865,560,,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1jy6phm/john_mayer_the_guitarist/,ed_d3

1jq5iiw,reddit,Is the major label music industry just kind of a big scam?,"We often hear about artists signed to major labels going bankrupt or still being in massive debt despite years of success. Some examples are [Thirty Seconds to Mars](https://www.nme.com/news/music/jared-leto-recalls-how-thirty-seconds-to-mars-were-millions-of-dollars-in-debt-3785501), [Whitesnake](https://www.musicradar.com/artists/there-was-a-50-50-chance-that-id-be-able-to-sing-again-and-we-were-usd3m-in-debt-the-dramatic-story-of-an-80s-rock-blockbuster) and [TLC](https://beat.com.au/the-dark-tale-of-tlc-going-bankrupt-in-the-90s/). The reason for this is that, recording deals are essentially a loan. They fund and arrange everything you need as an artist, including the creation and marketing of your album, appearances, etc. In turn, they get a cut from your sales (music, merch, tour), though some have better deals than others. Most successful acts end up making the label back their investments and don't have to get a ""loan"" again. Others aren't so lucky.

1. While I understand the label getting a cut from the sales due to their investment, it is highly unfair that the whole transaction is structured as a loan. No other industry—whether that's television, film, video games or publishing—is doing this to their artists. Jennifer Aniston can have flop after flop after flop on her belt and she would still be alright. She's not going to get as big a cut from her ticket sales and she may not get as many roles as a result, but the film studio is not going to demand her the funds they used to make the film. They write it off as a loss and move on. Why are musicians expected to pay this back especially when...
2. ...they delivered their part of the deal: which is to make the album. The album exists. It's a real product. The record company sells it. They own the masters/rights to it and can do what they want with it. They can license it for use on TV, film, video games, and make money from it.
3. Labels often sign artists for multi-year or multi-album deals. Some even go as far as 7 albums. The artists can fulfill their full duties and be successful for years and years, but one massive flop, and it's enough for the label to simply drop the artist with no repercussions to them. They can just decide one day to not fulfill their part of the deal. Clive Davis (Sony) is notorious for randomly deciding he doesn't like an artist and deciding to not market their albums or limit their distribution, and then use ""lack of sales"" as justification to drop them, when it was his fault in the first place.
4. Oftentimes, artists signed to big labels have their publishing LLCs administered through the big three: Warner/Chappell, UMG Publishing/Universal Songs, or Sony/ATV. Which means the labels still get a cut from their songwriting and licensing of those songs regardless.

1jnwe9l,reddit,Amyl & The Sniffers,"Tonight I saw the best punk performance since RHCP @ TFC 1998. This band is electric, chaotic and fiercly indignant. Also, they can play. The tight and forgiving rhythm section doesn't falter to a singer whose prone to chaos and enthusiasm within her vocal and visual performance. She transcends the audiences energy while projecting back 10 fold. 

 When these folks get together they make great music with a middle finger to anyone who makes others feel small or marginalized. This is folk lyrics with angry vibes and it's better than Chicken after church. 

This is the most exciting take on music and frustration I personally have seen and heard since The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.

No idea what the future holds but if they keep doing what they did tonight....... so it goes. I for one will keep showing up.

1jt87pt,reddit,"Are there any artists you would describe as ""one-album wonders""?","There are some artists that, despite a successful debut, were never able to replicate that level of impact with future releases. Take Alanis Morissette’s *Jagged Little Pill*, for example—an album that defined a generation with its raw emotion and catchy alt-rock style. Or Boz Scaggs with *Silk Degrees*, which produced iconic tracks like “Lowdown” and “Lido Shuffle” but struggled to maintain that level of success in later work. Even Third Eye Blind's *Third Eye Blind*, with its infectious mix of rock and alternative hits like “Semi-Charmed Life,” remains the band's most memorable record.

So, why do these artists stand out with just one major hit? Is it a matter of timing, where the world was ready for their sound at the time, or is it a reflection of creative limitations?

Don't listen to the radio that often, usually stream, but there are 4 radio stations I listen to and my car always starts the radio before it connects to my phone. 


Two of the radio stations are ""classic rock"" one is ""oldies"" (The Temptations used to dominate that channel) and one is ""variety"". They all play Tom Petty regularly and it seems like his music is ~15% of what is played on the radio. Guns N Roses also gets played a lot on all the stations too, but not quite as often. 


Was out of town this weekend and heard half a dozen Petty songs in the car on the out of town channels. 



I guess it's because he fits a lot of genres, classic rock, oldies now but not super old, I consider it folk, also could be ""easy listening""? I don't know.

I have loved this album my entire life, just like Sabbath, and i've not always been a metal fan.  Still, love both.  Also I like everything Metallica before the Black Album, not saying its good or bad, just the sound changed.

So Kill 'em all, And Justice for All, Ride the lightening etc are on my short list, but Master is so so so good.

Edit: I LOVE all the comments. The only way i could intro this is to say it, now i get to hear all of your albums.

Edit 2: I should not have included the 90s, b/c i don't enjoy the Black Album anywhere near as much as the earlier ones.

1jx636u,reddit,What’s a song that always makes you cry?,"For me it would be the Pogues’ version of “The Band Played Waltzing Matilda.” 

The shear emotion in Shane MacGowan’s voice, the depressing epic story, the uplifting music behind it, everything about it makes me cry every single time. For those who don’t know, it’s about a young Australian man going to war in Gallipoli during WWI and the horrors he experiences to his comrades and himself. It also vaguely explores his life back home after the war, too, as he utters my favorite lines:

“And now every April I sit on my porch
And I watch the parade pass before me.
I see my old comrades, how proudly they march
Reliving their dreams of past glory.

I see the old men, all twisted and torn
The forgotten heroes of a forgotten war
And the young people ask me, ""what are they
Marching for?""
And I ask myself the same question.

And the band plays Waltzing Matilda
And the old men still answer to the call
But year after year their numbers get fewer
Some day no one will march there at all.”

Tom Morello performing with Kaiser Permanente Therapists on strike today in Los Angeles.  -My wife is a therapist at Kaiser, and they have been on strike for Six Months! All the therapists want are the same benefits offered to the Northern California Therapists! More info in comments

**Some background info on the strike**

Nearly 2,400 mental health workers at Kaiser Permanente in Southern California have been on strike for almost six months now, fighting for better patient care, fair working conditions, and benefits equal to their Northern California counterparts.

The strike has reached the six-month mark, with workers continuing to hold strong despite significant financial struggles. Some therapists have even resorted to donating plasma to make ends meet while remaining committed to their cause. [Sandiegouniontribune](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/03/25/strike-by-kaiser-mental-health-workers-nears-the-six-month-mark/)

**What are they fighting for?**

The striking therapists, social workers, psychiatric nurses and psychologists are demanding the same guaranteed seven hours per week that Northern California Kaiser therapists receive for critical patient care duties, pension benefits that Kaiser eliminated for Southern California mental health professionals hired after 2014, and fair wage increases. [Nuhw](https://home.nuhw.org/2025/01/17/press-release-kaiser-permanente-refuses-to-offer-new-proposals-during-bargaining-thursday-as-mental-health-strike-in-southern-california-approaches-third-month/)

Back in 2022, a 10-week strike by mental health workers in Northern California ended with Kaiser agreeing to provide more time for patient care duties and increased staffing. Now, Southern California workers want those same gains, with State Senator Maria Elena Durazo supporting their cause, saying ""These workers are saying, 'Hey, wait a minute. You do this in Northern California. How about the people in Southern California?'"" [KPBS Public Media](https://www.kpbs.org/news/health/2024/10/21/kaiser-mental-health-workers-strike-southern-california-over-staffing-workloads)

The human impact has been significant. Patients who depend on these services have been left without their regular therapists, with some being offered outsourced access to therapists through online services. This has created anxiety and uncertainty for vulnerable patients already struggling with mental health issues. [CalMatters](https://calmatters.org/health/2024/12/kaiser-strike-mental-health-southern-california/)

Some patients have reported being ""hot potato-ed"" between different therapists without any continuity of care, leaving them frustrated and without the consistent treatment they need. [Courthousenews](https://www.courthousenews.com/southern-california-mental-health-patients-speak-out-during-health-care-worker-strike/)

Recently, in a powerful escalation of their protest tactics, striking therapists began a five-day hunger strike in early April outside Kaiser's Los Angeles Medical Center to highlight Kaiser's failures to address patient needs. [Nuhw](https://home.nuhw.org/2025/04/04/kaiser-mental-health-professionals-launch-l-a-hunger-strike/)

Today, the picket line in Los Angeles got a major boost when Tom Morello from Rage Against the Machine joined the striking workers to show his support. I was there personally and saw how his presence energized the crowd and brought more attention to their fight.

Morello joining today's action follows his long history of supporting labor movements. He has previously shown up for striking workers, like when he played a surprise set on a Hollywood picket line for SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikers, saying ""I'm here to support them and express my solidarity."" [NME](https://www.nme.com/news/music/tom-morello-plays-surprise-show-on-hollywood-picket-line-im-here-to-support-them-and-express-my-solidarity-3483070)

The strike continues with no clear end in sight. Mediation talks were prepared to begin as early as February 17, but the strike has clearly continued well beyond that point. [KPBS Public Media](https://www.kpbs.org/news/health/2025/02/07/kaiser-mental-health-workers-prepare-for-mediation-after-four-month-strike)

If you're in Southern California, consider stopping by a picket line to show support. These workers are fighting not just for themselves but for better mental health care for everyone.

If you youre inclinded to help the therapists continue their strike you can do so here - [https://nuhw.org/kaiserhardshipfund/](https://nuhw.org/kaiserhardshipfund/)

We all know a ton of music is released daily on Spotify, but some places like Bandcamp still seem to cater to the real artist and working musicians out there. 

This is sort of a psa to say that seeking out and listening to independent music is very time consuming, yet rewarding too, but I want to caution lazy and/or AI cover art. 

I do judge the search results by their cover art, it’s really all we have to go by when sifting through dozens of independent albums each day. AI artwork is almost a guaranteed pass on a curator listening to your art.  Lazy cover art is another big issue I’m finding on bandcamp. If you don’t care, why should a potential new fan care?

1k6bvew,reddit,"How a 1960s cult led by a former call girl gave us punk, goth aesthetics, and a Utah dog sanctuary","Mary Ann MacLean has a wild biography. Here's just a start:

1. Sugar Ray Robinson’s live-in mistress
2. Became a call girl—got busted
3. Joined Scientology
3. Got kicked out (with Robert de Grimston, who she’d later marry)
4. Co-founded a new cult: The Process Church of the Final Judgment — basically her remix of Scientology with apocalypse, dogs, and Jesus-Satan dualism

And then? She accidentally planted the seeds of punk.

Many of her followers started bands. One was The Voice, who dropped “Train to Disaster”—arguably the most punk-sounding song of the ‘60s.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7udR0EyUtFY

Guess who played in The Voice? Mick Ronson—yes, that Mick Ronson, the guy who later shredded guitar for Bowie on Hunky Dory, Ziggy Stardust, and Aladdin Sane.

But wait—this ride isn’t over.

She relocates her cult to Barbados. Then the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. Finally, they base their HQ in the USA—where police start investigating a possible link with the Manson cult.

In 1974, she ousted her husband and took control. Moved the group to Arizona. Rebranded it: The Foundation.

Then came the wildest pivot:
""We’re not about apocalypse anymore. We’re about animals.""

They moved to Utah and eventually became the Best Friends Animal Society—today, a squeaky-clean and respected animal welfare nonprofit.

But Mary Ann MacLean's influence doesn't end there.

Industrial, goth, and metal bands have been heavily influenced by The Process' aesthetic—to the point that their magazines have become collector's items. Genesis P-Orridge, for example, was a vocal admirer of The Process. Boyd Rice of Death in June openly collects Process memorabilia and references them in his art.

And what's the end effect of The Process? Well, Mary Ann MacLean pivoted the cult from an apocalyptic doom cult to one about kindness to animals.

She started with sex, spiraled through Satan, and landed on saving stray dogs—honestly, not the arc I expected, but kind of a banger.",2025-04-23 22:07:18,music,music,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,135,30,,0.69,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1k6bvew/how_a_1960s_cult_led_by_a_former_call_girl_gave/,tiggerclaw

1k4v86l,reddit,Do a lot of people stop listening to new music after high school?,"My inquiring mind wants to know, is this like a thing that a serious number of people do? If so, what are your thoughts on why this happens? 

I didn’t even know who I really was at 18, and had yet to experience most of the “real world” heartbreak and struggles that would shape a lot of the music I was drawn to and embraced throughout my life. 

Don’t get me wrong, I will stand by NIN’s Downward Spiral/Oasis’s What’s the Story Morning Glory/Radiohead’s Ok Computer til I die. But if that had been the peak of my new music discovery and appreciation, I would have lived a much less fulfilling life creatively, for sure. And I would have been exposed to so many less women and non-white and queer artists. This literally pains me to think about as a musician. 

I would have never had learned about Beach House or Janelle Monae or St Vincent or The Knife 🤯

How can music move forward and progress and evolve faster than a crawl if people stop consuming new artists’ music at 18? Where would we be right now if a large percentage of today’s adults’ new music-listening peaked at Blink-182? 

Oh shit. That would actually explain a lot.

Spotify feeds me samey music when I'd like it to branch out a little further. I use TikTok sometimes and love some of the stuff I come across, but it's very sporadic and doesn't really affect my Spotify algo when I ""like"" it.

I'm from the generation that'd find music by watching MTV or going to The Wall and listening to samples on a scanned CD with those greasy headphones. 

If it matters, I'm a big fan of alternative, midwest emo (I think that's what it's called, think Hawthorne Heights), rap (I'm pretty selective here), and some rap-adjacent techno-ish stuff like Freddie Dredd? Idk. Kinda lost.

I’ve got tinnitus and my doc has recommended I wear earplugs whenever I go to concerts to avoid further damage.

I was looking into the Etymotic ER20s since they seem to be pretty popular, but I’ve read a lot of mixed reviews about them. Some people say they don’t let in enough sound, while others complain that they make the music sound flat and lifeless.

I’m also considering the Alpine MusicSafe Pro and Decibullz Custom Molded Earplugs.

Alpine seems to balance sound quality and protection pretty well, but I’m worried about how comfortable they are for longer shows.

The Decibullz ones are custom molded, which sounds great, but I’m not sure if they’ll affect the sound experience

1jugue4,reddit,What are the best rock songs of the past 10 years?,"I have always been an alt-rock fan, and it is understandable but still depressing to me that tastes have changed and rock music hardly ever tops the charts anymore. 

That said, there are still plenty of rock bands around, and a lot of them are doing great work. So what are some of the good ones that have been coming out the past few years? Bonus points if they're catchy with great melodies.

Here are a few I've found, just to get the party going:

Now when I hear it, it just makes me nostalgic for a past age. Its really crazy to me that, even as recently as 2012, many basic 3 or 4 piece rock bands found massive success.

1jmprdt,reddit,Greatest Second Half of any Album?,"There are a number of records which I adore that somehow have a questionably weaker first half compared to its latter finale of songs. Examples of this for me would be Random Access Memories by Daft Punk, OK Computer/Kid A by Radiohead, In the Mountain in the Cloud by Portgual. The Man, Laterlaus by Tool, Spiderland by Slint, To Be Kind by Swans and Sound of Silver by LCD Soundsystem. 

HOWEVER, in my very honest opinion, there are TWO albums which I feel enter into the realms of perfection past the first half.

1. Siamese Dream by The Smashing Pumpkins (1993) - from Soma onwards it becomes a flawless record. Such propulsive energy, the emotional dissonance of guitars and vocals in Mayonaise - this is cinematic rock music made with the largest ambitions and intentions. 

2. Remain in Light by Talking Heads (1980) - after an instrumentally very worldly opening to the record, the entire song slows down more dramatically after the hit single Once in a Lifetime. Eno’s influence is all over this (I could have put Bowie’s Low in this too) and the minimalistic, often mumbling Ulysses’s style train of thought thinking is peppered over Seen and Not Seen and then a complete full collapse of existential wonderment in the terrifying The Overload. Genuinely an album of stark contrasting halves, it’s the second half that impacts me more personally.

Anyways this is my first ever post, please help me if I’ve done anything wrong with the setting up of this discussion!

1jr8abw,reddit,Is anyone a fan of the band Poco?,"Poco was co-founded in 1968 by Jim Messina (the same Jim Messina from Loggins and Messina), Rusty Young (for a short time a member of Buffalo Springfield and a virtuoso on the steel guitar), Richie Furay (co-founder of Buffalo Springfield and later a member of The Souther-Hillman-Furay Band and a founding father of Christian Rock), Randy Meisner (founding member of Eagles), and George Grantham. Their 1969 debut album, Pickin' Up the Pieces, is a very influential country/southern rock album (the only debut album EVER to earn a 5 star rating from Rolling Stone) which unfortunately came out around the same time as the Flying Burrito Bros. album. Meisner left after the first album and was replaced by Timothy B. Schmitt (who ironically replaced Meisner in Eagles about 8 years later), and along with the addition of singer-songwriter Paul Cotton (who wrote many of Poco's more well-known songs, including Heart of the Night), formed the classic era of the band.

Poco never had the commercial nor critical success of Eagles, but had a very similar sound. Their 1978 album *Legend* (which marked a stylistic change in the band to a more radio-friendly sound) contained two Top 20 hits, Crazy Love and Heart of the Night, both of which get decent play on 70's and oldies stations. But the band had so many other great songs. Rose of Cimarron is a beautiful Western ballad, Bad Weather is a really underrated ballad, and their comeback Top 20 song, Call It Love, is a cool modernized take on their 70's output. 

Poco has lost most of their members and officially disbanded in 2021 after the death of Rusty Young, who had been with the band throughout it's entire history (including after a couple of breakups/hiatuses) and semi-retired from the band in 2014. The only surviving original member is Richie Furay, who had appeared occasionally with the band after leaving in 1974.

Poco is a severely underrated, underappreciated band that helped pioneer country/southern rock. Their primary members during their prime are (except for Grantham and Cotton) in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for their contributions with other classic bands of the time, and they all were phenomenal musicians. I think they deserve more recognition!

Please share stories if you have any about this band and let the Poco fans take over the comment section!

One of the most underrated music videos of all time from arguably the most politically controversial band ever.

I will admit, for all his intensity, Zach de la Rocha's lyrics are often drowned out by his band's awesome guitar riffs and the general chaos of Rage's music.

Rage had four songs pulled from stations after 9/11, more than any other band or artist.
But read the lyrics to ""Testify"" or ""Killing in the Name"" or ""War within a Breath"" and you'll see why the band genuinely scares those in power — and why they are so relevant, and so incredible.

These guys know the media is our enemy, almost all politicians are corrupted by money and power... and that we, the people, need to fight for our freedoms before the powers that be strip us of them.

1jswee3,reddit,Song with the most covers,"I've always loved Bob Dylan's ""Don't Think Twice, It's Alright."" The lyrics are lyrical yet the ultimate middle finger break-up song -- I mean, ""you just kinda wasted my precious time?"" I love the original, but was first introduced to the Peter Paul and Mary version. The Indigo Girls interpretation was my favorite for the longest time, but barely over Susan Tedeschi's.  And, for giggles more than anything else, I tracked down a French language version by Hughes d'Aufray that I enjoy.

Anyway, for further giggles, I'm putting together a collection of covers, and am up to 152 version (caveat: many artists are represented with multiple versions as I decided to not worry about studio versus various live versions). The running time is up to 9 hours, 46 minutes, for whatever that information is worth.

I'm not at the end of the list (which has yet to be in sight), just taking a breather and listening what I've got so far (on random play--it seems the only fair way). This, though, has got me wondering:

What song has the most recorded covers?

1k5n8x7,reddit,"So, what's the backstory on the great online prewar music massacre anyway? Does anyone know?","Caveat: Not here to start any arguments about opinions on this or that. I'm only asking for actual facts, if anyone knows them, because I haven't found a thing.

Fans of older music were probably aware that up until a few years ago there were a few Youtubers (and some others with dedicated websites, like the Swazoo Kulak Jukebox - IYKYK) who made it their business to upload every old 78 etc. they could get their hands on. Some uploaders had done lot of careful restoration work too.

Some of these collections were ludicrously enormous and were essentially archival, with detailed artist information, recording/pressing information, band members (often uncredited on those old recordings), and so on. It was a great way to introduce new people to prewar Ragtime, Jazz, Blues, Swing, etc. by pointing them to, e.g. RagtimeDorianHenry on Youtube or a one of the half-dozen similar accounts.

It seems like, at some point a few years ago, all these accounts and sites (as I said, mainly Youtube accounts) were nuked from orbit. While the majority of content on these accounts were public-domain music, not all of it was, and it's not unreasonable to assume there was maybe a copyright strike or something. But... at the same time, past mass copyright strikes usually were followed by the rights-holders monetizing their archives, and I've not yet seen any company putting up large archives of prewar music on Youtube or any of the main streaming platforms for *any* amount of money.

So... what happened anyway? Is anyone familiar with the details?

And has any archive appeared to at least partially replace what was missing, or are all the magnificent collections of prewar music once again scattered and lost? Just seems like an enormous loss to music historians and fans of early music to have had such an accessible collection for maybe the first time in 80 years only to lose it all again. Certainly not what Alan Lomax had in mind anyway.

Don’t know if anyone else has jumped into this one yet but what I love is how it’s still got that classic Bon Iver ache, but it’s not stuck in the dark. Justin’s voice is front and center, confident as hell, and the collabs add just enough spice without stealing the show. It’s like he’s saying, “I’ve been through it, but I’m good now, or at least I’m trying.” Feels personal, like he’s singing to you.

Honestly, SABLE, fABLE feels like catching up with an old friend who’s been through hell but found some light. It’s hopeful, human, and so freaking beautiful. I’ve had it on repeat, and it’s got me feeling all the feels. If you’re into Bon Iver or just want something real, give it a spin. It’s worth it.

After a long, stressful day at work, I love nothing more than sitting on my couch, drinking a beer and letting the whole album play from start to finish. It’s the perfect soundtrack for just contemplating life. 

The way it flows, the layers, the emotion – it still holds up as one of the greatest albums of all time.

1k68nz1,reddit,My Grandpa,"My Grandpa was Kenny Crawford. He was a guitar player and musician who used to play at all of the old bars and nightclubs on the Gulf Coast. He owned and operated a recording studio. The studio was called Lincoln Recording in Pascagoula, Mississippi. He traveled and played with and befriended many famous singers and bands. My Grandpa lost his house and recording studio in Katrina and died of a heart attack a little over a month later. 3 Doors Down recorded their demo at my Grandpa's studio back in 2000. I actually remember seeing them practice at my Grandpa's studio. His guitar solos were amazing and his favorite thing to do. My Grandpa wanted me to learn how to play guitar young like he did. I really adored him and was proud of him and wanted to learn and be just like him. He had two sons and neither one of them ever wanted to learn how to play. He started teaching me when I was 8 but Katrina struck and he died shortly after so I never got to finish learning. He wanted me to be his protege but unfortunately fate didn't.
