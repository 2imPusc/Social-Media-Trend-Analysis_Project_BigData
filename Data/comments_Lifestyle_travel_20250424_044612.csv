travel,1juovvv,mm3vsji,"This would be a lot easier to answer if we knew your itinerary. Most tourists visit 3 or 4 general areas in Lisboa proper: Baixa/Chiado, Alfama, Parque das Nacoes and Belem. The other big stop is the Gulbenkian which is out of the way regardless of where you stay. 

Principe Real’s biggest issue is that a lot of it is not convenient to the metro so you have to walk to the metro or take the bus, both of which add a lot of time and Lisboa is somewhat hilly so walking isn’t always a ton of fun. If you’re staying along the northern or eastern edge of the neighborhood near a metro stop it’s workable. 

Chiado would be much more convenient to tourist sites and the metro. 

On the other hand Principe Real is a very nice area with lots of fine dining if that’s your thing.",4,2025-04-08 21:38:04,User5281

I know there are no Alps, but given your interests, I genuinely think you would have a more worthwhile time in the first option. Your money will also go further here - Bavaria, and Munich especially, can get very expensive.

Heidelberg, Strasbourg, Colmar, and the Route des Vins villages are some of the best preserved German architecture in the world. Honestly much more so than places like Munich, Nürnberg, or Würzburg (not that their architecture is anything bad). It will also be a nice cultural contrast to see Germany (BaWü) and then Alsace for a bit of French flair thrown in to spice up the trip. 

For places to visit outside of the aforementioned here are my recommendations:

• Around Heidelberg: Ladenburg, Heppenheim, Ettlingen, Speyer

• Alsace: Riquewihr, Kaysersberg-Vignoble, Ribeauvillé, Eguisheim, Barr, Turckheim, Bergheim

To go with your Day 6, you could check off Puerta del Sol and Gran Via nearby, or you could relax and explore one of the neighborhoods near Centro. La Latina, Malasaña, Lavapies and Chueca are all good choices. I assume Plaza Mayor was on your radar for Day 6 already.

If it were me I'd start in Bangkok, overnight train to Chiang Mai, a day or so in Chiang Rai. Maybe even up to Pai. Then fly down to explore some islands. Or Khao Sok National Park first? Spend a few weeks exploring by scooter, snorkeling, island hopping... Then maybe finish with a couple more days in Bangkok

In CT, Go to boulder beach to see penguins, take the cable car up table mountain and then fly into skukuza and get a rental car. Stay within the park for 5 days, book accomodation via sanparks.com and stay on 4 different lodges. You can also book some drives, like night drives, via lodges. If you self drive you can have air conditioning or heat (note safari vehicles can be freezing or sweltering, self drive is so so easy in Kruger unlike other safari destinations). We saw the big 5.

Mexico City 3 nights  
Tepoztlan 2 nights (Mountain town outside of CDMX, I'd do it for 1 night and honestly had the best meal of the entire trip there)  
Puebla 1 night  
Oaxaca City 5 nights  
Towns outside Oaxaca 2 nights (Tlacolula for the incredible Sunday market, Teotitlan)   
San Jose del Pacifico 3 nights  
Coast around Puerto Angel 8 nights. Wasn't much safe surfing in that area, so Puerto Escondido would be a better surf fit - but for us, that area is way too touristy. Even Mazunte (a nearby hippie town) is too overrun with tourists for our taste. It was nicer to stay out of town and pop over to these spots on a motorbike. We found a pretty secluded beach with lovely snorkeling and no more than 6 other tourists there at any given time. It was magic.  
Back to CDMX for 2 nights. 

Honestly, I would not have changed a single thing about the itinerary except maybe 2 nights in  Puebla and only 1 in Tepoztlan. 

Based on your desire for culture, Oaxaca is such a slam dunk I think you'd be smart to spend at least a week in that area. DM me if you want any more specifics. :)",1,2025-04-14 20:41:16,floataboveit
travel,1jtndbo,mlvodja,"I visited Iguazu in February and it's truly incredible. It's going to be a lot of travel with kids, so I would really think through whether you think that stress is worthwhile. I can't speak to the weather at that time of year.

There are only two truly higher end hotels in the area: the Belmond on the Brazil side (worth every penny) and the Gran Mela on the Argentine side. If you're in BA, you'll fly into the Argentine side of the falls. 

To make things more complicated, I would say the only higher end hotel in the area that is truly worth the splurge is the Belmond. The hotel is within the park and allows you to access the falls outside of park hours, so you can see it without anyone else around you. It really was worth the price and the trouble of getting there. The hotel itself is a stunning historic building and has a nice pool. The rooms are a little smaller since it's an older building, but they are well maintained and comfortable. But again, the real selling point is the off hours access to the park. 

On the Argentine side, the Gran Melia looked nice, but it doesn't have park access, and was really expensive. We opted for the LOI, which was significantly cheaper than the Gran Melia but was still very nice. Your kids would love the pools. We were able to hire a private driver who picked us up at the hotel, took us to the Argentine side of the park in the morning, and drove us to the Belmond after the park. The Argentine side of the falls was really beautiful too, and if you get there right as the park is opening, you can see parts of it without many other people around. 

Happy to answer any questions you have! Enjoy BA!",4,2025-04-07 15:44:13,americanatletour
travel,1jtndbo,mlvyo8n,"Yes, it was one of the most impressive things I've ever seen. Stay for two days and do both the Brazilian and Argentinian side. There's a lot of hotels in either Puerto Iguazu and Foz do Iguazu, and cabs from the cities to the falls aren't too expensive. Though if you don't get the Brazilian Visa it's still worth it to do just the Argentinian side. 

  
The Argentinian side is large and there's a lot of lookouts for different levels of waterfalls, and you get to go right up to the devils throat and see how hard and fast the water falls. There's a lot of coatis that are really cute and will try to steal your food, and a little train that takes you up and down the lookouts. The Brazilian side is smaller and requires a bus ride from the parking lot, but it has a more all encompassing view, and I saw a wild capybara and her babies near the falls. and there's a bird sanctuary near the entrance that's worth it to check out too.",2,2025-04-07 16:37:13,Jino_bino_3057
travel,1jtndbo,mlvz1oy,"I’m glad you responded! Those are the two hotels I was looking at, although I only did a quick search to start and didn’t realize the Belmond was on the Brazil side! So you switched hotels on the other side? Is that needed? If we went, I think we were thinking of just doing 2 nights and sticking to one. Could we fly into the Argentina side and still stay at belmond? I will check out LOI",1,2025-04-07 16:39:09,technoguy06
travel,1jtndbo,mlw00rz,"We stayed at the Belmond and it was fantastic. With little kids, I think it would be perfect. You can walk from your room to the falls/park trails and as a hotel guest, you can access the area after the park closes and before it officially opens. Experiencing it without crowds is amazing and unforgettable! 

The Belmond has great food, too. Service was impeccable from start to finish (it also helped that we got a room upgrade as we were there midweek in the off-peak season).

I don't think the Gran Melia is worth the price because it doesn't come with park access.",1,2025-04-07 16:44:14,wannabejetsetter
travel,1jtndbo,mlw9h08,"Hotel and which side is certainly still up for consideration. But it sounds like it is totally worth dealing with the pain of packing up and traveling there, even with 2 kids because it is an amazing view.",1,2025-04-07 17:31:50,technoguy06
travel,1jtndbo,mlx57ej,"We were in BA this past December and spend 2 nights 3 days in Iguazu Falls, and stayed the 2 nights at the Gran Melia.  That hotel is fabulous,  I am sure the Belmond is also nice,  but I would not hesitate to stay at the Gran Melia again.  Not sure where the other posters are getting that the Gran Melia does not have direct access to the park,  literally walk out from the swimming pool area, and the park is right there.  You do have to pay a park fee, but that fee covers your entrance to the Argentina side, and one fee is good for all days of your hotel stay.

I think I posted a brief trip review of our stay in this sub months ago, so you can search on it.  But 2 nights is a perfect amount of time.  Also, if you can time your visit to during a full moon,  on the Argentina side,  you can do the Full Moon walk out to the Devil's Throat trail on the 5 nights around the full moon.  This was an incredible experience.

Our schedule at the Gran Melia was as follows:

Day 1:  Flew from BA to IGR early morning,  got into the hotel around 1pm,  we walked one of the trails (lower level).   In the evening,  we did the Full Moon walk out to the Devil's Throat

DAy 2:  Hired a private driver to take us to the Brazil side of the falls.  Left our hotel around 9am.  The Brazil trail took about 2 hours to finish, then we did the powerboat ride and the bird park.  Got back to the hotel around 5pm

Day 3:  We checked out of the hotel, and left our luggage with the frontdesk.  At around 10am we started the rest of the trails on the Argentina side (Upper and Devil's throat).  We finished around 2pm.   Went back to the Gran Melia, and spent time at the pool and ordered lunch at the pool.  Relaxed around the pool till around 5ish, then went to the spa/gym to shower and freshen up before heading to the airport for our return flight at 7:30pm to BA.

I really like Gran Melia allowing the guests to spent the day at the pool, and using the shower facilities with lockers at the spa.  Good to freshen up after a long day of hiking the park and extra pool time.  The infinity pool is just amazing, and the view from the pool of the Falls is worth every penny.

  
Would totally recommend to stay at a hotel that is inside the park, if your budget can support it.  The convenience is just so much better and the time savings is worth it.

Oh another thing to look into is the hotel/airBNB in BA, if  it may be same or not much more to book it for then he week, versus the 4 nights.  A lot of times the weekly rental  is not much more,  then you can just leave most of your stuff in BA and pack some small things for IGR.
We did that with the BA Marriott, I was using reward points to book, and a 5 night stay was 90k points, for a 3 night stay that we were actually in BA would’ve been 65k Marriott points,  made sense for us to do the 5 nights for 25k more.",1,2025-04-07 20:13:54,YYZ_Flyer

travel,1jtndbo,mlxmmov,"I will go against the consensus here and say that I would not recommend it. We took our 4 year old son to Argentina from the US last fall and basically did exactly what you’re proposing. We spent 5 full days in Buenos Aires before flying to Mendoza for 4 nights, then back to BA for a couple more. Even with the lack of jet lag, it just wasn’t quite worth it to us to add the extra traveling…mainly because travel is tougher with kids, as you know. So while the falls sound amazing, you’re proposing even less nights there and with an additional child than we dealt with, so it would give me hesitation. But hey, we absolutely loved Buenos Aires so much that we are planning on returning and when we do I will open-jaw it into BA and out of Iguaza or Patagonia or somewhere else that we missed out the first time :)",1,2025-04-07 21:46:04,Rittiman

If you are in Munich prior to Christmas, you will be able to hit the Christmas markets, and there is a good chance for snow. Same for Salzburg, as it is more in the mountians. 

But one thing to know, Munich and most of Germany close down midday on Christmas eve, and I mean close down. The markets end, and will not open again, as the Christmas season is over.  But come midday Christmas day the resturants ect start to reopen. 

Same for Salzburg. Salzburg is really really nice around Christmas, and we liked it better than Munich. We wish we had spent more time there. We did a day trip on Christmas Eve from Munich, given that Munich would be shut down. 

We then took the train from Munich to Paris on Christmas day, which was a delight. And then got to experience Paris all lit up for Christmas. 

  
You will be hit or miss with snow no matter where you go. Munich had half a foot the week before we went, and it did snow when we were there. In Salzburg, it snowed on Christmas Eve, and the mountains got feet of snow.

Its hostel-scene is also forlorn...just share a decent hotel by Jalan Sabang (Sabang Street), if you end up going.

travel,1jren9d,mlf0mh8,"My two cents.. 


Are you planning to many places? Maybe. Personally, I would skip a few. Ibiza is the first one to come to mind - yes it's good for partying, but that's also easy to find in cities like Paris or Barcelona! Best tip is to just ask the locals where the best night life is. And if you want to go a place just for partying I would honestly choose Berlin over Ibiza any day. Both with regards to quality and price.


Another thing to consider would be adding some smaller/less known cities. A lot of your destinations are extremely crowded during the summer months, and you might get tired of always being in a queue. One example could be going to Bologna/Padua instead of Florence. Valencia instead of Barcelona. Etc.


For food: The Michelin Guide app is great, it also includes restaurants that don't have stars, but are good bargains. It has found us many great restaurants at a reasonable price.


Another tip: Don't book everything before you go. You will always find hotels to stay at, and the price difference is not that bad. You could even find some amazing offers. For romance: personally, nothing beats staying an extra night at a place you enjoy. Or going some place you get recommended.


Enjoy your trip, and congratulations in advance on your engagement!",4,2025-04-04 18:29:44,Swebroh

Don't worry too much about it being too sleepy, you can always base yourself in a bigger town like Aix, Avignon, or even Arles. I would personally stay in a nice historic village but with enough restaurant options as a home base like Fontaine de Vaucluse or L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue, but that's just me.

One last mention. Given your interests, don't rule out other regions of France. Especially the Dordogne, Alsace, or Burgundy. They can be equally if not more charming than Provence and a whole lot less touristy.

Admittedly a lot of other canadian NPs are not so noteworthy. The ones that come to mind as nice are Fundy Bay and Gros Morne.

What I quickly learned going outside of the US is that the ""brand value"" of being a NP is much more dubious in many countries. Almost all the NPs in the US are amazing and distinct nature destinations, but this is a much less reliable signal in many countries. My advice would be not to focus on them. Definitely still look at UNESCO sites, but beyond that many of the most beautiful areas you can visit will not actually be NPs.

Nope, that won't work. You can't apply for a fresh E-Visa while the original E-Visa is still valid and in force. The initial E-Visa has to be stamped out of the country before the second application can be submitted.

travel,1jpnscg,ml0sgpu,"The most authentic feel of the Polynesian culture you'll have in French Polynesia. The infrastructure is good everywhere, the best internet you'll have again in FP. In FP, the most fancy tourists accommodations are on motus with their great over water bungalows. The disadvantage is that your experience of the Polynesian culture is very limited, because the locals live on the island, not the motus. That's why we stay on the islands. The difference between FP and the Cooks is that the Cooks have loads of visitors from NZ and the vibe is influenced by them. It's still great and we go there when we're in FP but the natives, even though they're related, are not as ""native"". We like Rarotonga for its bars, restaurants, markets, live music and sports (Rugby, Soccer).

The rest depends on what you want to see/experience. Naturewise, the islands that have mountains such as Tahiti, Moorea, Bora Bora, but also Rarotonga etc have spectacular views with the lagoon on one side and the mountains (up to 1800 m high) on the other. The Marquesas are offering even more spectacular views, but they don't have a lagoon and less infrastructure. Then, there are the flat islands such as the Tuamotus with great diving options.

Boat tours are amazing. Fishing trips take you out for miles and looking back to the island is just wow. Snorkeling, whale and manta ray watching is closer to the islands but also great fun. Take boats that take few passengers (e.g. 5-7). You can also hire private trips. Also, local guides will take you on walking trips. Here, I can thoroughly recommend Kura Happ (Rarotonga, find and contact her via her Facebook site).

There are plenty lagoons to choose from. We love the ones at Bora Bora and Aitutaki. Bora Bora has a great beach (Matira) with white sand and good snorkeling right off the beach. Tahiti and Tahiti Iti have great black sand beaches. Aitutaki's lagoon is larger and its colors of blue are just spectacular. Only go on a boat trip when the sun is out.

One other thing that is amazing, and is rarely mentioned, is that in FP, the eldest son is sometimes raised as a female and they are then called Mahu. You see Mahus often in e.g. Papeete working in service (restaurants and shops) and they are the sweetest people I've ever came across and I've traveled a lot.

Both Greece and Italy have lots of rocky shores and lots of sandy beaches; it depends on where you go. Tuscany has plenty of nice sandy beaches, for instance.

Your best bet for warm and sunny weather in April in the EU is probably Cyprus or the Canaries. Crete and Sicily, perhaps, it could be very pleasant or rainy and cool.

Any actual town will have places opened in April. It’s only the tiny tourist-only towns on small islands and the like that essentially close down outside of summer. If you want nightlife and meeting people, though, you’ll want a proper city, which contrasts a bit with wanting to just chill by the sea. Also, most cities don’t have nice beaches next to the city centre, because either the core is a port or the seaside was marshland/sand dunes in historical times.

travel,1johy1z,mks2uvr,"Depends on where you're going. The rental car companies will very often have the ability to pay the tolls for you, through the receiver in the car or through license plate verification. The issue is that they often charge what I believe are absolutely ridiculous, near-scam level administrative fees for this. Some charge high daily fees the moment you incur your first toll.

A few months ago I had a car in and around the NYC area and went through tolls on two days, and Thrifty charged me $167.94. They said I had agreed to a specific tolling plan. I told them that they were nuts and I defiantly did not (which is true, since I knew it was not worth it to me), and I got a refund of $123.42.

$123.42 in garbage fees for going through 4 tolls over three days. Of that remaining $44 dollars some of that is fee too.

travel,1johy1z,mks3wml,"In the US, it seems toll authorities often have a way to do a one-time payment based on the plate. But, if you're renting a car, some rental companies will opt you in to their toll-payment scheme (which usually involves ""convenience fees"" above and beyond the actual toll) or a daily pass (e.g. PlatePass which has a daily cost whether you travel on a toll road or not). You can sometimes opt out of those services (just make sure that if there is a transponder in the car you keep it shielded so it's not picked up) and then after incurring a toll go to the website of the local toll authority, put in the license plate, and the range of dates/times you want to pay, and pay them.

Driving through Europe (France and Italy) about a decade ago, most toll booths had at least one lane to pay in cash (often by tossing coins in the bucket). In some countries, you need to buy a ""vignette"" to use the motorways legally (Switzerland comes to mind); sometimes that can be a sticker you put on the windshield (that you buy in a neighboring country before crossing the border) or sign up online with a credit card and the license plate info. From what I've read, a lot of European tollways are putting in credit card readers with ""tap to pay"" (so you might be able to use ApplePay or GooglePay or a credit card with the tap-to-pay symbol).

(On a slightly different topic) One caveat with using US credit cards in Europe (at least several years ago) was that often European card readers were set up with chip-and-PIN authorization but US credit card companies hadn't enabled that on their cards (they had enabled chip-and-signature which wasn't used in Europe).

travel,1jofeja,mkrqh8z,"Regardless of what you decide to carry outside and regardless of what country you visit, always keep the smaller bags and pouches in front of you, whenever possible; i.e. all hip packs and fanny pack should be worn in the front, especially while walking in crowded streets and markets or while standing inside a tightly packed bus or train.  Sling bags are more versatile than backpacks, but with both, use twist ties to keep pull cords tied together while walking through crowds - it actually deters creeping hands from trying to quickly reach into your backpack in a crowded area.

Google ""RFID Blocking money belt"" and have both you and your gf wear that UNDERNEATH your shirt/blouse/t-shirt (many product photos show money belts worn on the outside around the waist).  That is where I ALWAYS keep my most valuable small/flat items such as US passport, US drivers license (my backup ID), my 1 or 2 credit cards, all my money that may sometimes be more than $3K USD cash because I do not trust hotel room safes, etc.  My phone and wallet (with one credit card and less cash) go inside my front-facing hip/fanny pack or a front-facing zippered pocket; i.e. never trust any rear hip pockets, even if they have zipper or velcro closures.   A flat RFID-blocking money belt worn underneath your shirt and slightly tucked into the top of your pants with the shirt covering it is more secure than any pouch or bag that is worn externally.  The only drawback is that you may look slightly overweight in photos, but unless you only wear tight-fitting tops, no one knows about your hidden money belt, and any attempt to access it will be noticed because you have it slightly wedged into your pants in the front.

Italy is not dangerous, but the larger cities, especially the crowded touristy areas, of both Italy and Spain do have statistically higher concentrations of pickpockets compared to the rest of Europe, the U.S., and Asia.   When I was prepping for trips to Spain during the late 1980s and early 1990s, I had lengthy discussions on the rec.travel Usenet newsgroup (this was before websites were invented) about a common tactic in Spain where a crowd of children would enthusiastically run up to greet you and hug you, but 1 or 2 of those children would be stealing items from your pockets while the other children would provide distractions by pretending to enthusiastically hug you.

If you can leave ALL your jewelry and fancy clothing at home, and do not look or act like a rich or ignorant tourist, that also greatly reduces your risk of being a crime victim in ANY country (my wife and I also leave our wedding bands at home).   I previously lived and worked in Brazil and Africa and my wife and traveled by car through numerous countries (love South Africa, Namibia, Kenya, Ethiopia, etc) where we were often the only light-skinned people in at least a 20-30 mile radius, and we never got robbed because we never displayed jewelry or looked like fancy people in poor areas (we both wore solid tan or brown baggy clothing).  In the poor areas, I took thousands of photos using a small Canon point-and-shoot camera.  In larger African cities, I often carried a Canon 5D in a Think Tank Digital Holster 30.    In some areas of the world, some locals mistaken a camera holster for a large firearm holster and leave you alone (true!)   And during 3+ years of living and working in Africa and visiting numerous African countries, I always wore one of 5 or 6 money belts under my clothing; sometimes the belt gets a bit sweaty after a full day in the sun so I would switch to another belt on the next day.",1,2025-03-31 23:16:23,KrunchyPhrog

travel,1job5i4,mkqhuy4,"Very generally, San Francisco to Yellowstone over 3 weeks is reasonable. It’s a 14.5 hour drive if you go direct. 

Neither Las Vegas or Zion are on that direct route and so would add significant drive time. For the most part, those will be interesting drives through mountains, forests, and deserts. Up to you on whether that’s worth it. If it was me, I would probably limit the trip to the things that are roughly on the way there… something like San Francisco, maybe Yosemite, Tahoe (+Reno if you want a taste of Nevada Casino culture), the salt flats & SLC, Grand Tetons, and then Yellowstone. 

As you’re finding out Yellowstone is remote and not super convenient to get to. Denver is going to be your closest main hub airport but it’s a 10-11 hour drive away. Your best bet is probably going to be to take a regional flight from Bozeman Montana to another hub, whatever is cheapest and makes the most sense for your ultimate destination. 

I think the western United States and the national parks are a fine trip for foreign tourists. Yellowstone will probably be crowded. I would maybe add some driving down highway 1 along the pacific coast towards Big Sur if possible.

Going from SanFran to Yellowstone is doable in 15 hours so theoretically you could ease your way into things with three weeks and spread out your trip.

Paris feels very safe to walk around generally, and I say that as someone who loves staying out by Clignacourt and Barbes, which a lot of folks malign. 


What does your daughter like? What interests her about Paris? If it's just about the two of you getting time, prioritize bakeries and cafes and your river cruise, where you can talk and be together. If she's got specific interests (art, fashion, food, history) build around that.


Staying up around Montmartre (southwestish of Sacre Couer) puts you a little away from the sights you want, but is a lovely neighborhood for a 13 year olds first time abroad, and especially Paris. Alternatively, staying in the latin quarter is a classic, classic spot, and while it's busier now than sometimes one might like, that might be a plus for feelings of safety. Plus, if your daughter's a reader, you have Shakespeare and Co. right there which is a very famous English language bookstore.

travel,1jnuvku,mkykbyh,"Don't stay in Laureles. I have no idea why people like it so much (I lived in Laureles for a month btw). Laureles has bad air pollution (since it sits low in the valley), and you won't get a place with a nice view (at least compared to one of the neighborhoods in the hills).

One of the best parts of staying in Medellin is being able to rent a high-rise apartment with a great view. It's truly an amazing experience. If you don't mind having to take Uber/etc. to get to the metro station, I recommend Alto Poblado, or perhaps the other neighborhoods you mentioned.

Unless you're dead set on Cartagena, you might consider a more rural town like Salento or Jardin, especially for the hiking. Only thing is that these towns take a while to get to. Cartagena is totally overrated in my opinion.

Another place nearby there to chill and watch people surf is Zurriola beach. We stayed near the main city center area which we liked because it was very walkable. One of the places that we ate was a really good little brunch spot called Enxalao, right near Zurriola. Edited to add, the pinxtos are everywhere and we really never had anything bad.

travel,1jnlzoc,mkl8v6k,"You're off to a good start. To answer your question, you don't ""need"" a car but having one is helpful. Deciding what to do and where to go may depend on whether you have a car or use the excellent bus system.

The train from Bologna to Bolzano takes about 2.5 hours. You can spend one night in Bolzano or add a second, depending on what you want to do and how well you're set up. There are busses and car rental offices near the train station in Bolzano.

When I made this trip in 2023 we had a car and stayed just outside of Ortisei. I can highly recommend this location for a couple of reasons: Good accommodations (but can be expensive), good access to bus routes (our hotel was on the SP64 and had a bus stop out front), there's good access to the Alpe di Siusi and Seceda by cable car (two days of hiking right there), and fairly good restaurants. Castelrotto and Selva are easy to get to by bus (one per hour or per half hour during the day). We had our car but used the bus just as much.

If you elect to rent a car you can get to Cortina and Tre Cime more easily, plus other hiking areas around Bolzano. But with three or four nights in the mountains this isn't necessary.

I assume you'll do a lot of hiking. I can't tell you anything about the night life, I'm old. Often there's not a lot of it in these ski towns in the summer. But lots of young hikers. We had a wonderful time and are going back this fall for our third trip to the Dolomites.

But then again I am someone who hates driving and never will if it's avoidable. I appreciate others disagree and may prefer one. But it's unequivocally wrong in my mind to say that got need one.

I would say the two easiest areas to stay without a car are Cortina d'Ampezzo and Selva Val Gardena. Certainly other options as well. Both have very dense regional public transport networks. I would say the network around Selva Val Gardena is slightly better as services tend to be more frequent and the season lasts longer. Going to Cortina d'Ampezzo outside of peak season is harder as many of the lines are seasonal. You'll be fine at that time of year.

Of course they can, if you don't have permission to enter the country then you won't be able to leave the airside part of the terminal.


If you do leave, just remember to give yourself time to get back through security - the airline probably won't be too helpful *if* you ended up missing the second flight. And on the way out of the airport you'll need to pass through immigration.

I would suggest driving from Bucharest to Curtea de Arges and spending your first night there. The next day take the Transfagarasan road to poenari citadel (the Transfagarasan is a spectacular road - please don't feed any wild bears you may see). 

Once you have seen Poenari citadel continue on the Transfagarasan to Sibiu and spend the night there. 
From Sibiu drive up to Corvin Castle and spend the night in Hunedoara. 


Leave Hunedoara and take the long drive (maybe 4.5 hours) to Peles Castle and spend the night either in Brasov or Sinaia.  For your final night you can choose to return to Bucharest or go wherever you fancy. 


Be aware that the motorway network is quite limited and you will be spending a lot of time on single lane highways, but the scenery is usually spectacular.

Then head to Sinaia, to visit the Peles castle, but on the way there go and see Cantacuzino castle, where Wendesday was filmed, they are both jn the area called prahova valley. Head back to Bucharest and enjoy the last night there. 
Sincerely this is the best way to see your points of interest as the distances are pretty far and the traffic in Romania can really suck (source-I live here).
Romanians use Waze instead of google maps for driving, but google maps should do the trick at aproximating the distances and at choosing acomodation or where to eat. I recomend to stay at hotels with good reviews 8+ score on Booking. 
Also at the last part of your trip, when going from sighisoara to sinaia you can also stop by Bran castle, it’s a bit of a detour but it is doable, but save some time in the next day to fully enjoy peles and the area. 
You can also do this loop in oposite direction. It’s not necesarry to spend the first night bucharest, if you arrive early enough and head to Sinaia first, but make SURE to spend the last night in bucharest, do NOT attempt to drive from the mountains to the airport on the same day, it might get really crazy.

travel,1jkizva,mjvy6u2,"Hi, taking the car into another EU country is now accepted by some rental companies in Romania (for an extra fee) but yeah, dropping it off abroad will be complicated or expensive.

You can drop off the car in Arad or Oradea, both are large towns near the border, along major routes into Hungary and with plenty of connections to Budapest by bus or rail. 

The main Romanian bus planning site is [autogari.ro](https://www.autogari.ro/?lang=en) , you'll find timetables for the Arad-Budapest or Oradea-Budapest routes.
Train timetables can be found on the international section of the Romanian railways site [CFR](https://bileteinternationale.cfrcalatori.ro/en/booking/search) 

Almost all rental companies allow dropping off in a different domestic location, altough there's usually also a surcharge for doing that.

BTW if you plan on renting from a small rental company with strangely low prices, expect to get ripped off.

Public transport will work fine, and Uber is there too.

I’d suggest taking the train on a Saturday to the market in Ventimiglia, which is just across the Italian border. From there, catch a bus to Dolce Aqua which is a small town in the hills east of town. Lovely way to spend the day.

Wherever the train does not go, take a bus.",3,2025-03-24 03:17:27,Bigfred12
travel,1jihajg,mjfr9ij,"Most of the major sights are along the main coastal railway line. That line gets frequent and good quality service. The busses outside of Nice aren't quite as reliable, but the google maps schedules are generally accurate. Eze is lovely, and I've stayed there a few times, if it's just a day trip I'd encourage you to walk up the paths from the coastal village to the cliff village. The walk is well-signed, nowhere near as arduous as it looks and really quite lovely.

There's a lot to do in Nice before you start factoring in day trips to Eze, Monaco, the Cap-Ferrat... So it might be an idea to weight your trip less equally, maybe 6/4 or 7/3. I don't know Saint-Tropez, but there's interesting things around the Cannes area, (strong recommendation on a daytrip to the Iles de Lérin). Nice centre is not fun to stay in with a car, but a vehicle can become more useful the further inland you go.

If I were you I would consider two ways of doing things. One - after landing go inland to one of the pretty hill villages for a few days proper holidays R&R, you don't want to have a holiday without a bit of a break. After that, do a full week in Nice using it as a base to swing out to other places on the best railway hub. It might be worth renting a car for this, but honestly I took the train to Entrevaux and it was lovely. Two - Do 6 days based in Nice or one of the towns like Beaulieu to the East and do everything you want to do in Nice and out towards Monaco, then move to somewhere like Grasse or Cannes to cover more of the west. There are things to do further west but you'll have seen a lot of beaches and pretty Riviera towns by this point. Both Cannes and Grasse are lovely, but not as well-situated bases as Nice and generally less to do.

In terms of tourist season unfortunately I think you'll still catch the wave. The French Riviera isn't as affected by Northern European school terms as many of the other big summer sites, it pretty much feels busy any time April-October, but once you're away from the beaches it's not so bad.

travel,1k5deve,mokleap,"My wife i travelled through botswana chobe , maun and the delta then around namibia many years ago.  We didn’t go to the kalahari though.  

For Namibia We just had a 2wd vw polo hired in windhoek and camped in our two man tent and also stayed in local accommodation in the towns. In namibia you can buy fresh food and meat in both supermarkets but also in etosha itself.  I wouldn’t destroy my holiday eating freeze dry!  Go for the hearty bobotie, kudu steaks and boerwors!

Same with botswana where we were at least able to get basic staples - pasta vegetables etc.  But the lodge food was better than our cooking.

We just had a basic trangia stove, but only used it where there werent restaurant options.

Namibian food is very hearty and tasty - german and sth african influenced.

Its pretty cold at night but you usually get firewood if you stay in the  campsites.

Not sure if your trip allows it but we really liked the hike up to bushmans paradise in spitzkopje (with chains - its steep).
We also did the waterkloof trail near soousuvlei/Tsauchab.  We stayed at Tsauchaub river camp which was good.
We stayed in the camps just outside etosha because they are much cheaper and easier to book…and they were really nice - even if you are just camping.   E.g Onguma camp (etosha east) - had a really nice bar/restaurant and pool that you can use

Alot of the namibian camping lodge options include outdoor fires and woodfired showers which was a nice change after 3 months of cold showers for us.

Please forgive any spelling mistakes.  I haven’t had dinner yet and my keyboard sucks.

Not sure if your will have room in your camper,but we learned that its customary to pick up local hitchhikers.  There is hardly any public transport, so its great to give locals a ride to the town.  They often to walk long distances to do daily  life.  We met lots of interesting people that way.",2,2025-04-23 07:28:14,marktthemailman

Absolute Africa 
G adventures 
Intrepid 
Oasis 
Nomad.  

I think Africa overland is a broker, not a tour operator.   But I'm not particularly familiar with them.  

Oasis and nomad tend to be higher end.  

Intrepid and g adventures are mid-budget,  and depending on the trip you go on at least some of the time. People are more interested in drinking than anything else.  

Absolute is the cheapest, and it's the one I went on.  

One thing that may not be clear from their marketing material, if you look at their longer trips you can get on and off that trip at really any point.   So you might be able to do a more customized trip depending on what you want.  

With any of the overland tours, and the guide will make or break your trip.   You don't have a lot of control on the group you're on, but if you're looking at the under 30 trip, expect that there Will be a lot of partying.   

If you choose to go on the absolute trip, I would see if you can figure out which driver/bus you'll be on, and if you can manage to get the gray truck it's good . .   I would avoid the trucks with the roll-up windows.

That gives you some sense of the distances, but also I wanted to point out the Mackinac Bridge and Mackinac Island are really great places to visit.  If you started up there and worked south you, you would probably use 2-3 days total. Even 1 night on Mackinac Island would be nice -- rent bikes and ride the 6.3 miles around it, or do it as an easy hike. Ferry service is fast and plentiful. You can't walk across Mackinac Bridge (except around Labor Day), but I think you would find even a round-trip drive to be pretty cool.

Working south, catch M-119 -- the tunnel of trees -- at Cross Village and take it south to Harbor Springs. Harbor Springs is a lovely town and you can easily find good places to eat, summer concerts, and various festivals.  Keep going south-ish and you'll hit Petoskey which is another very cute town with nice highlands that give a good view of Lake Michigan in spots. Pick up M-31 there and head to Charlevoix, which sits on a small channel between Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix.  It's a great town and would be my pick for where to spend the night on day 3 or 4.

From there, you could head to Traverse City on M-31 (it's maybe 50 miles from Charlevoix), which is the biggest city in the NW part of the state (about 20,000 people). Plenty of parks, concerts, festivals, etc. It's also the gateway to NW Michigan recreation.   If you don't want to spend any time there, you can continue west to Sleeping Bear Dunes. A little to the south there is good kayaking and canoeing on the Crystal River, and there are several outfitters in the area. Once you finish your day you could make good progress south along M-31 or M-22 (slower, but more on the coast).

I would pull up Google Maps and plot this out a little different, go to Phoenix before Flagstaff/Sedona then on to Grand Canyon on your way to Vegas and Zion and Salt Lake.

travel,1k2fdba,mnv5mlv,"Travelled to both regions in June over past couple years. I’d expect Puglia might be slightly less busy than algarve in August, but only marginally, these will be very busy places in August regardless. Beaches/hiking wise I think the algarve is better, specifically Lagos is wonderful for beaches and a coastal walk along the cliffs, and the town is lovely. A bit of a touristy town but the food is still good.

However id say Italy wins for food in general between the two options. Food is incredible and some of the best I’ve had in Puglia and you’re more likely to find authentic experiences in some of the smaller towns like martina Franca, locorotondo and ostuni if you venture out of Bari for day trips - some of these towns are inland and not coastal but still wonderful to wander about for a day. lovely beaches in polignano a mare which is not far from monopoli but is quite a popular beach spot. One slight downside though is that driving in Italy is a bit of a nightmare imo.

Overall for a relaxing beach/coastal break I’d say Algarve fits more of your criteria. For Puglia I’d say to enjoy what the region offers would take a bit more effort as there’s so many places beyond Bari and monopoli that are amazing but not necessarily by the beach, and so might not be what you’re looking for.
