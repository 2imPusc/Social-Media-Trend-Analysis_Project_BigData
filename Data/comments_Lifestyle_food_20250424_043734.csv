Meatballs
Ground beef
Eggs

1/2 tsp baking soda for elasticity 
Stale panko bread crumbs soaked in milk
Broiled on high for colour 

Sauce
Romas, grape tomatoes
Tomato paste
Onions
Garlic
Lots of oil
Sugar

Sauce I always start with half inch of oil, and I essentially lightly fry the tomatoes and onions, I don’t mix it as to prevent any contact of sauce and the heavy bottom pan.

food,1jmk70d,mkcgb2e,"Recipe:

Poke a lot of holes in the skin, this is what adds to the crispiness.

Slice the meat side into cubes, making sure not to get into the upper skin/fat layer.

Season the meat side. I used 5-spice, sugar, salt, pepper, and garlic powder.

Brush the skin with vinegar (I used rice vinegar but any white vinegar will work) and add some salt (some use a salt cap but I just add salt to taste).

In an air fryer, cook for 30 minutes at 95 C to dry out the skin

Brush some oil on the skin (not necessary if you poked the holes) and cook for another 30 minutes at 200 C.

Let it rest, cut up, and enjoy.",10,2025-03-29 12:26:23,sniff_the_oj

food,1k095lt,mncffp7,"**Strawberry Puree:**
- 1 pound (454g) fresh strawberries, rinsed and hulled
**Cake:**
- 2 and 1/2 cups (285g) cake flour (spooned & leveled)
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 3/4 cup (12 Tbsp; 170g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
- 1 and 3/4 cups (350g) granulated sugar
- 5 large egg whites, at room temperature
- 1/3 cup (75g) sour cream or plain yogurt, at room temperature
- 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup (120ml) whole milk, at room temperature*
- 1/2 cup reduced strawberry puree (see step 1)
- optional: 1–2 drops red or pink food coloring

**Instructions:**
Make the reduced strawberry puree first, and let cool: Puree 1 pound of rinsed and hulled strawberries. You should have a little over 1 cup. Stirring occasionally, simmer the puree over medium-low heat until you’re left with 1/2 cup (about 135g) or slightly more (you need 1/2 cup for the cake). This takes at least 25–35 minutes, but could take longer depending on your pan or how juicy your strawberries were. Allow to cool completely before using in cake batter. I always make the reduced puree the day before so it has plenty of time to cool down. I cover and place in the refrigerator overnight. Allow it to come back to room temperature before adding to the cake batter. (See Notes for further make-ahead instructions.)
Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease two 9-inch round cake pans, line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans. (If it’s helpful, see this parchment paper rounds for cakes video & post.)
Make the cake: Whisk the cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together. Set aside.
Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed until smooth and creamed, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a silicone spatula as needed. Beat in the egg whites on high speed until combined, about 2 minutes. Then beat in the sour cream and vanilla extract. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed. With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients until just incorporated. With the mixer still running on low, slowly pour in the milk *just* until combined. Do not overmix. Whisk in 1/2 cup of room-temperature reduced strawberry puree, making sure there are no lumps at the bottom of the bowl. The batter will be slightly thick. Stir in food coloring, if desired. (I use 1 small drop of pink gel food coloring.)
Pour batter evenly into cake pans. Bake for around 24–25 minutes or until the cakes are baked through. To test for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, it is done. Allow cakes to cool completely in the pans set on a wire rack. The cakes must be completely cool before frosting and assembling.

**Frosting:**
- 1 cup (about 25g) freeze-dried strawberries
- 1 cup (16 Tbsp; 226g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
- 4 cups (480g) confectioners’ sugar
- 1/4 cup (60ml) heavy cream or whole milk, at room temperature
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- salt, to taste

**Instructions:**
Using a food processor or blender, process the freeze-dried strawberries into a powdery crumb. You should have around 1/2 cup. If it’s not grinding down fine enough, you can sift it with a fine mesh sieve to rid larger seeds/pieces. Set aside.
In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter on medium-high speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add confectioners’ sugar, strawberry powder, heavy cream/milk, and vanilla. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then switch to high speed and beat for 2 minutes. Taste. Add 1–2 more Tablespoons of heavy cream/milk if needed to thin out, if desired. (I usually add at least 1 more.) Add a pinch of salt if frosting is too sweet.",5,2025-04-16 02:36:09,ObsdianDrknssHelena

**Ingredients:**

  - 2 Tbsp vegetable oil, divided
  - 0.5kg sirloin steak, cut into strips
  - salt, to taste
  - black pepper, to taste
  - ½ red onion, sliced
  - 1 medium tomato, sliced
  -  1 red bell pepper, sliced 
  -  2 Jalapeños, seeds removed and sliced into long strips 
  - 2 cloves garlic, minced
  - 1 Tbsp aji amarillo paste
  - 2 Tbsp soy sauce
  - 1 Tbsp white vinegar
  - 1 Tbsp fresh cilantro, chopped
  - 0.5kg french fries, cooked, hot
  - white rice, cooked, for serving, optional

  
**Steps:**

1.  Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large pan over high heat. Add the steak, season with salt and pepper, and cook until browned, 5-6 minutes. Remove from the pan.

2.  Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in the same pan, then add the red onion and cook for about 5 minutes, until softened and browned. Add the red bell pepper and jalapeno and cook another 3-4 minutes. Add the tomato, garlic, and aji amarillo paste, and cook for another 5-7 minutes, until the tomatoes have released some of their juices, but are still intact.

3.  Add the soy sauce and vinegar and stir to combine, let cook for 1 minute.

4.  Add the steak, fries, and cilantro. Toss gently to coat the fries in the sauce.

5.  Serve with rice, if desired.

\* I use frozen fries, toss them in vegetable oil and cook in air fryer for convenience. Cook them longer than normal so they hold up longer in the sauce.

I always reserve some to serve on the side as well, for extra textural variation.",9,2025-04-10 10:42:11,Dangerous_Ad_7042

Combine peppercorns, sugar and salt. Place 2 or 3 sprigs of dill in the bottom of a nonreactive baking dish. Sprinkle about ¼ cup of salt mixture over the bottom of the dish. 

Place the salmon, skin side down, on top of the salt and dill, and place a few more sprigs of dill on top of the salmon. Sprinkle all over with another ¼ cup of the salt mixture.

- added salt, pepper, a bit of thyme, a touch of ground clove, and garlic powder to the ground pork, mixed thoroughly, made 6 big balls. 
- fried up a large diced onion (in olive oil), added a can of diced tomatoes and a bit of water from washing out the can, salt, pepper, a good pinch of marjoram, tiny bit of basil, tiny bit oregano, tiny bit of rosemary, 3 bay leaves (live a little).
- seared the pork balls, put them into the sauce, cooked about an hour or so, cooked off the sauce a little more on its own after the balls were done to drive off some liquid.

Result was amazing. Simple. Uncomplicated. I think adding much else would just complicate things. Like, maybe some wine for the sauce?",4,2025-04-02 17:04:05,crimsontape

food,1k1m3q6,mnn65qy,"Hi:-) So l've made some potato pancakes (direct translation from my language), not sure
how else to call these. :-)


If you want to try it, here you go


The dough: 
●6 Potatos (not small ones, middle size )
●1 1/2 -2 - cups flour (1 mean a tea cup for example)
●2 garlic gloves 
●1 egg 
●dill to your taste
● 1 tsp baking power 
●salt, pepper, paprika to your taste

Cold butter or ghee (to spread it on the hot pancake)


The yoghurt-garlic dip: 
■ 5 garlic gloves
■ yoghurt 200 gr
■ dill to your taste 
■salt to your taste


1. Boil the potatos, mash them once their done. Let it
cool off a bit.

2. Add salt, pepper, paprika, garlic (1 used a garlic
press), the egg and dill, then mix it.

3. Add the flour and baking powder, then knead the
dough

4.  Form dough balls and dust them with a little flour
just SO the dough won't stick to your rolling pin (you
can make them bigger or smaller, resulting in bigger
or smaller pancakes)

5. Roll them out with a rolling pin and bake them one
by one one in a pan ( the stove shouldn't be too hot,
I used 6 for the first one, then put the heat down to 4
once the pan was hot enough already), without any
oil.

6. Once the pancake is done, spread some cold
butter or ghee all over it, put a bowl on top of it
so they stay hot while you continue repeating the
process.


The dip:

Use a garlic press or just mince it very finely. Add
the garlic into a bowl, add your yoghurt, some salt
and dill (lf you want)

We had some black tea with it. That may be a little
weird for you guys, but where I come from, we usually have a cup of tea with food like that.

If someone tries it, let me know :-) would be
interesting to know if you liked it.",8,2025-04-17 20:02:26,Rayhana95_

food,1jyav7m,mmww8ef,"# Ingredients

* 3 lbs russet potatoes peeled and thinly sliced
* 2 tsp olive oil
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp pepper
* 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese
* 1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
* 1 cup diced ham
* 2 cups heavy cream
* 2 tsp Dijon mustard
* 3 cloves grated or minced garlic

# Instructions

* **Preheat the oven** to 450°F. In a large bowl, toss the thinly sliced potatoes with olive oil, salt, and pepper until evenly coated.
* In a medium saucepan, combine the heavy cream, garlic, and Dijon mustard. Whisk until smooth, then heat over medium until the mixture is warm and just beginning to bubble. Remove from heat.
* Line a 9×13 sheet pan with parchment paper. Arrange half of the sliced potatoes in an even layer on the pan. Sprinkle half of the diced ham and half of the shredded cheddar cheese evenly over the potatoes.
* Layer the remaining potato slices on top, then carefully pour the warm cream mixture over the entire dish, making sure it seeps into the layers.
* **Bake** for 20 minutes covered. Then, remove the foil and sprinkle the remaining cheddar cheese and the Parmesan cheese on top. **Return to the oven** and bake uncovered for an additional 30 minutes, or until the potatoes are fork-tender and the top is golden and crispy.
* **Let the dish rest** for 10 minutes before serving. Finish with a sprinkle of sliced scallions or chopped chives for a fresh, flavorful finish.",7,2025-04-13 15:58:18,lonelyisland789

food,1jxg7js,mmq2e27,"Ingredients:

3 overripe banana medium size (7/8"" long)

1 cup brown rice syrup or 3/4 cup maple 
syrup

1 1/2 cup gluten free rolled oats

1 cup wholewheat flour

2 tbsp. ground flax seeds

1 1/2 tsp baking soda

1/4 cup melted coconut oil

1 tbsp. vanilla extract

1 tsp. ground cinnamon

Optional toppings:
1 small banana sliced
2 tablespoons jumbo oat
2 tablespoons brown rice syrup or maple syrup

Method:

Preheat oven to 180 C (375F).

Prepare a rectangle loaf tin 23 cm x 13 cm (9"" x 5"") covered with baking paper. Set aside.

Add all the banana bread ingredients into the bowl of a food processor with the S blade attachment. 

Start with the dry ingredients first flour, oat, baking soda, cinnamon, ground flax seed then coconut oil, brown rice syrup, vanilla extract and whole ripe banana.

Blend on low speed 30 seconds. Stop scrap down the sides with a spatula and repeat this process until you obtain a thick batter with no more lumps of banana.

Pour the batter into the prepared loaf tin.

Decorate the top with slices of fresh banana, brush the top of the banana bread with maple syrup and sprinkle some extra jumbo oat if you like.

Bake 45-55 minutes or until a chopstick inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean.

You may need to protect the top of the bread with a piece of foil during the last 15 minutes of baking to avoid the banana slices to burn.

Fully cool down in the loaf tin before transferring into a cooling rack.

Store wrap into a towel to keep all the moisture of this banana bread or pres-slice the bread and store in the pantry wrap individually into plastic wrap.

Store well up to 5 days in the pantry at room temperature.",6,2025-04-12 12:37:43,doorshock

https://youtu.be/SDpCzJw2xm4?si=nsAd8z3VYzT2mQbB

Prior to putting the toppings on, I usually chuck the base in the oven for a few mins to start the cooking process. That way the toppings don't soak into the base as much and make it soggy

food,1joek8d,mkrsfw9,"First of all, you're starting a wonderful and rewarding journey, congrats! My recommendation besides the dough is to get a pizza steel, stone, or cast iron pizza pan. The stone is cheaper but will eventually break. The steel (1/4 or 3/8 inch) or cast iron will last a lifetime.
Getting those preheating (usually 50-60 minutes) at 500-550 degrees (typical max of home ovens) before cooking will *significantly* improve the performance of a domestic oven and your resulting crust. Cheers and happy baking!!!",2,2025-03-31 23:27:38,Choice_Process7880

food,1joek8d,mksyk5t,"If you want chewier dough, you’ll need to develop the gluten more. I do several series of stretch and folds over a few hours while letting the yeast ferment the dough. 

Based on your pizza slice picture, the crumb looks a bit dense there. How much water to dough do you put in? Some more water and hotter baking temperatures may help you here. You may also need to stretch out the pizza more  to speed up the cooking process. 

Others have mentioned Brian Lagerstrom videos. His 1 dough 3 pizzas video gives clear instructions on how to make a Neapolitan like pizza, but there are other good videos out there. ",1,2025-04-01 03:56:09,HowitzerIII
