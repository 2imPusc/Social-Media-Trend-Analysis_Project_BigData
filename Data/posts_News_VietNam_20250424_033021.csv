VietNam,1k0eia9,Group Dining Recommendations in HCMC,"Hi everyone! I’ll be in HCMC in a few weeks for an event and at one point we want to hold a dinner with 10-12 friends.

This group aside from 1-2 people are all foreigners, and love Vietnamese cuisine. I’ve been trying to find recommendations online for restaurants suitable for group dining (bonus points if it has a view) but can only find mostly fine dining or international cuisines. Given that it’s all visiting travelers I think the group would best appreciate a restaurant focusing on local foods, but maybe we should stick to that while we explore the city and this dinner could focus on something else that comes highly recommended. This group is also fairly casual, so we’d be fine with a wide variety of environments from casual vibes up to high end and dressy.

Maybe I’m being too picky, so if you have any suggestions that you would take a group of foreign friends for dinner please drop them in this post regardless of any of the requirements I’ve set! I trust local opinions more than anything from a bunch of travel blogs. Especially interested in any quirks, like specialties in their menu, a view, etc. If there’s something unique maybe we’ll try to go there anyways even if it doesn’t fit this dinner!

VietNam,1jzmf4c,2 weeks in Vietnam,"Me and my partner are heading to Vietnam this May for a 2-week trip. We're flying into Ho Chi Minh City and looking to keep the trip relaxing, with some light cultural bits, great food, and ideally being able to scooter around somewhere chill, not super urban.

We’re not backpacking — looking for mid-range Airbnbs or villas, somewhere peaceful where we can explore beaches, small towns, and eat well without the intensity of moving constantly.

I've already done Sapa, Hanoi, Lào Cai, and Ha Long Bay on a previous trip, so we’re trying to stick to the middle and south of the country this time.

Here's the catch: I’ve searched around this sub and everywhere people seem to be saying things like this.

* Hoi An – “too touristy” ""beaches are gross""
* Phú Quốc – “feels fake/commercial”
* Con Dao – “not the real Vietnam”
* Da Nang – “just a big city with a beach” ...so I’m a bit stuck.

What I *am* looking for is something with the same vibe as Ko Lanta in Thailand — laid-back, scenic, scooterable, not too built up but still with some options. Could be coast or countryside, or even a combo.

Where would you actually recommend, based on what we’re after?

In the ensemble theres multiple singers that take turns singing and then maybe towards the later parts they all sign together.

It starts with a really catch whistle that kinda sounds like the chorus, and then the chorus is something along they lines of (from my non viet memory): tiet ai tiet ah something something

Initially I planned to spend 2 days exploring the area and 1 day trip to Ha Long Bay and back for my solo trip. 

But seeing the recent posts about HLB is making me rethink my plans. 

It's one of the more iconic landmarks in Hanoi so it feels like a wasted trip if I don't go. But then again I'm afraid I might not enjoy myself there

Should I still go ahead and at least experience it once? If so what would the best way to go about doing it. I was thinking booking online (any recommendations?) or going there to book by asking my hotel if there are any recommendations. 

I read that the roads are really dangerous? I feel like I will be fine jaywalking and crossing so long I keep a steady pace and wave my hand or something but I'm still afraid that if anything does happen I'll be at a loss on what to do. 

Grab is the way to go right? From the airport to my accommodation? Or should I check with my hotel if there is a pick up service? 

And how much cash should I prepare? I have Youtrip & Revolut which I can both use but I'm guessing some places will not accept cash.

VietNam,1jybkmp,Ha Long Bay worth the visit?,"Hi all,

Im going to Vietnam from the 30th April to 16th May. Staying in HCMC for a couple nights before flying to Hanoi where I’ll be staying from the 2nd-10th May. 

My plan was to stay in Hanoi for the first 2 nights, 4-6 in Ninh Binh which leaves me 6-9th unbooked. I originally wanted to do 2N 3D in HLB but have heard mixed reviews, I.e trash in the water, polluted waters, overcrowding, etc and the cruise I was going to book is Elite of the Seas. I assume most cruises have the same itinerary, but idm paying the extra £££ for a luxury one.

I have heard Cuc Phuong is a great place to visit too and that Ninh Binh is pretty much the in-land version of HLB, so don’t want to “waste” time if HLB is not worth the visit.

Any suggestions based on your experiences?

VietNam,1jx5y9m,What would you like to see represented in fictional Vietnamese characters/stories?,"Hello! I am an artist from Canada, and I really like having a large, diverse cast of characters.

I have Hoàng Bảo (left) and Võ Xuân (right). While Vo is a decently common last name, I named him after Võ Quý since Xuân has a bird sanctuary and studies zoology and ornithology!

He has a pet crow called Tien (meaning immortal), would this be an odd name to give to a bird?

Bao is very basic lol. He's a classic salaryman.

Firstly, do these characters ""look"" Vietnamese? Would you be happy seeing them in a series or comic? If not, what should I change?

Secondly, (this brings me back to the title of the post) what would you want to see represented through Viet characters? They're still in the very early stages of development so I'm open to everything! Favourite foods, passtimes, family life, etc etc etc  
  
I know how important representation is, and I really enjoy learning about cultural differences + including them in my artwork.

* How is property usually divided in Vietnam after a divorce? (if property in her name?)

I’ll have 3 full days free in Hanoi this April, and I’d like to explore somewhere outside the city. I was thinking of visiting Mai Chau, Pu Luong, and Ninh Binh. Do you think this itinerary is doable?

Do you think I can optimize this plan in any way? Should I skip something?

VietNam,1juofy6,Cost of seeing a dr or hospital in Hue,"Hi everyone, I hope someone can help me know what to do or where to go. I’m currently in Hue and managed to hurt my ankle. I don’t know what I did other than get sunburn on my lower legs and feet, but my right ankle (which I’ve injured in the past) is really hurting when I put any weight on it. It was swollen before bed last night so I elevated it, but this morning I’m struggling to put any weight on it despite the swelling being gone. How much would it cost for me to go to a hospital, clinic, or see a dr just to make sure I’m ok? I’m American so medical bills are a scary thing. 

Thank you in advance to anyone who helps! 

P.S. I am traveling with someone who can translate so English speaking isn’t a firm requirement. 
They found one Dr (Phòng khám Đa khoa VNMED). Does anyone have experience with them? 

UPDATE: Went to a clinic I mentioned above which is near the hospital. They got me in pretty quick and the dr said I have inflammation in my ankle and a possible infection. They prescribed me 4 medications to help with the inflammation, infection, and pain. He did speak some English, but I was very happy to have my partner to help translate everything and help fill out paperwork. The Dr visit cost $5 USD and all of the prescriptions cost $26 USD.

Its their first time traveling in South East Asia. They'd like to see the rural countryside. Small towns/villages. Just get a real feel of the culture. I've been to Vietnam a few times myself and my concern is that because they won't be riding a motorbike around and they will predominantly be using buses to get to places that everywhere they go will be the typical tourist destination that is now overcrowded with tourists. I know a lot of places in Vietnam have lost their charm from over tourism (Halong Bay, Hoi An by the river at night, etc) so I'm just a bit unsure where would be best for them to spend a week and have a nice time.   
I was thinking of basing them in Hoi An and doing a couple little trips from there but that time of year looks to be the worst time to travel due to the rain. Also wasn't sure if there would be any nice small towns to visit from Hoi An.   
The other option I was thinking about is North. The weather looks better that time of year and they could spend a couple night in Hanoi and do a trip to Ninh Binh or if anyone had any recommendations of nice small towns to visit that aren't too far from Hanoi.
