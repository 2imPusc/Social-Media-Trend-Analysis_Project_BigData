This was my orange cat. We got kittens and he was estatic. Would cuddle them and bathe them and love them.

Even when they got big and would literally pin him down to give him love baths.

I always knew he wanted kittens because he would carry socks in his mouth at nightand cry and only other cat I had do that was a girl cat who babied a kitten we took in.

mm4wvyk,1jus9m2,reddit,"I've found male kitties are much more accommodating to a new kitten than females for whatever reason. Whenever I've introduced a kitten to an adult male cat, they are bonding in a day. On the other hand, my 6-year old female cat STILL gives a wide-berth to the now 3-year old kitten, and they will get into a tiff at least once a day. She often still hisses at the baby for no reason as well, just for being within 2 feet of her. And this is after 3 years of co-habitation in a two-floor duplex apartment! XD

I'm glad yours seem to be much more friendly. They even look like they could be related! <3",2025-04-09 01:08:37,6,Ceejai,aww

Once she grows and her neck gets longer, she will be able to reach around most of her shell so you wont be able to carry her. Lets not start that habit and then have a major catastrophe. All turtles can be docile creatures **at times** but you can cannot trust them to be sweet and innocent all the time. Just like boop noodles. 

I say all this, bc i had a alligator snapping turtle on my property for years. It was probably every bit of 25”-30” in size, and was the heaviest thing i have ever carried with a 2x4. 🤣 Every time that stupid thing would get in the road and scare all the neighbors and their kids and stop traffic, i would retrieve it with the 2x4 or a broom handle to get it out of the road back towards its pond.",2025-04-05 12:26:03,11,eeyorespiglet,aww

mll3ydg,1js0glh,reddit,"This is how it starts. Four years ago, for us. She wandered up onto the patio. We fed her a strawberry. Then it became a daily thing. Every early morning. We have to keep a stock of romaine lettuce, various veggies, and her favorite- strawberries. She also hunts snails and insects as she circumferences the house after her breakfast. And she’ll get impatient. If you’re just sitting there and not getting her snacks, she’ll climb up onto your feet and nip at you. We named her Shelly.

Then two years ago, another female started coming by for a feeding. I guess word got out. She became Becky. Because she’s moody. If they’re too close together she’ll pick a fight. So we have to feed them at opposite ends of the patio. 

And starting last year, occasionally we’ll see a big bruiser of a male hanging out around the edges and under the bushes. He’s not interested in snacks. He’s here for the ladies. We’ve dubbed him Pete. Because why not? 

I think we’re officially tortoise ranchers now. I think when you get to three that’s the law.",2025-04-05 19:27:27,6,arminghammerbacon_,aww

• The lamb/goat/sheep comments had me and my husband dying laughing! I really needed it they were too funny and we actually looked up a baby goat and well....you guys were right!

• This little lamb pup is a girl! She was super brave at the vet, although she did test positive for hookworms. She's on medication and they said it should clear up as long as she gets those meds in her system. Other than that she's doing just fine!

mjyiqq4,1jknati,reddit,"I want to clarify some things for people who are concerned that I took someone's cat

1. Cat didn't stay here, I let her go after feeding her, I am not going to adopt her. She came back the next day for some more. We're managing a hotel and live in one of the rooms at the time. There's no space for a cat to permanently live here, and I can't stand pet fur in my living space.
2. I live in a small village that had a population of 140 by 2014 census. Fewer than that now. I made an effort to find out if the cat belonged to anybody and nobody is claiming her. There are seriously a ton of stray dogs and cats here. Dogs usually get kicked out by owners because they do not have ""desirable genetics"" (people breed Caucasian/Georgian shepherds here and just kick the puppies out on the street when deemed as low value), so they're just roaming around trying to survive. There's also a ton of stray cats, though they're less noticeable.",2025-03-27 04:03:19,10,suavecoyote,aww

Until after about 2 weeks of having him, I was sitting on the floor talking on the phone. He would run up to me and nibble my my muffin top. ( my little fat roll over the top of my jeans ) lol! Then he'd run away. Do it again, run away. 
I put a really small, whole apple down for him, and he figured out how to get a bite out of it by rolling it over to the wall and holding it steady while he took a few bites to get him started. Then he carried over to the couch and ate it. It was kind of amazing to me. Smart and a sense of humor! 
We bought electrical tape and that tubing to prevent him from chewing wires. It wasn't too much of a problem. I think the cats actually kept him out of danger by adopting him.

If in fact the witness is recalling correctly, and many times they do not, 

If there was actually teeth marks left on an ankle, and IF there might be evidence of an actual culprit 

who is to say that said ankle was not an instigator by making any kind of movement? And the cute kitty, if they were to have been concerned about this,  merely could have worried for the safety of both their human and themselves- could have reacted in the moment. 

Without pictures of an ankle being nipped, how can we fairly adjudicate this matter?

mmtvyb5,1jxr0u8,reddit,"Lol, my fiance's elderly parents have a very shy German shepherd. So shy she is commonly under tables and under the bed. Doesn't play at all.

We bought the house recently and are remodeling it into a 2 family for us. So I've been there often working for hours. She was so shy and coy that she'd let me get a pet in then literally slink away. 

I'm weird and bring a ridiculously unnecessary amount of snacks wherever I'm going. Was eating some goldfish from my stash and saw her slink from one area to the next. I called her on her way under another table and gave her some goldfish. Since then, I've deemed a good one/ good to approach. 

She's an old dog, and with my fishies, I've gotten her to sit and do paw. She'll come now when I call her instead of radio silence. Such a sweetie. Shy dogs are so strange, and you have to let them be like that. Respect those boundaries. 

Like, if she hid, I wouldn't follow. If she took a pet and walked away, I'd assume that's all I'm getting, lol. It's a weird dance before a shy dog will feel comfortable in your presence. 

Good on you!",2025-04-13 01:50:15,1,Defiant-Dust-8737,aww

At first we noticed the ones on the lower levels going missing, they'd later be found in the dog's bed where she had neatly unwrapped them and eaten the chocolate.

We started only putting them on the higher levels, since she was about 40cm high and mayber a metre fully extended we figured 2m off the ground was sufficient.

Later on we heard rustling coming from the living room. I expected to find hunting the lower branches sniffing for them but I was not prepared to find her clining to the tree having shimmied up to where we had moved the chocolates. We were immensley surprised by this since she was completely blind as well and had been for years.

A wet cold chick that cannot find its way to the hen's protective warmth will die. Or the chick can lose humidity and stick inside the shell. 

Folks, don't try to do this, if you are tempted. Let the hen handle things. 

If OP did indeed find the egg hatching outside of the hen's protection, the responsible thing to do is *gently* push the egg back under her. She will tuck it back where it belongs.",2025-04-14 19:49:13,1,OlympiaShannon,aww

When we took him in, he was sick with a virus, he also had problems with his eye, fortunately we cured him.

He was also sick when he got infected with another virus from the neighbor's cat. He could have died that day, but fortunately everything turned out well.

On the other hand, I was the favorite of a cat and then she gradually changed her mind.

HATED WOMEN. instant scratching/freakout upon proximity to human females no matter what. apparently, the cat was owned by a family with 3 daughters who didnt know your not supposed to carry a cat by the tail. she wasnt people friendly at all either, pretty obvious how poorly treated she was. other cats took advantage of her size and she was bullied constantly, i had to keep her in a tiny, tiny room with me for a few years because of it. she was better with men, i even got her to the point i could do the tss tss tss thing and she would stop whatever she was doing and come over to me, ""on command"".

like 10 years later after first getting her, after moving around and having to leave the cat with my grandparents, this 20+ year old cat slowly walks over to my grandmothers leg....slowly headbutts her leg, just once, and accepts 2 or 3 headpats before leaving. literal ground breaking progress. felt pretty good that she slowly warmed up.",2025-04-22 20:38:30,1,smuttfiller,aww

I already had 4 cats and didn't want another, but I ended up keeping him. We named him Sprout. We only had him for 6 years before he passed due to a heart defect. He was a wonderful little orange doofus. I miss him.",2025-04-16 05:15:51,3,FreyjasCat21,aww

mlkwlvc,1js5zgs,reddit,"Edit:
I am not gonna keeping the cat full time. If he wants to come in, I let him in. If he wants to leave, I keep the door to my garden open so he can leave whenever he wants. As for taking and getting neutered and vaccinated: I don’t know his medical history so I don’t want to take risks and overstepping when I don’t even know the owners. It might stress him too much to catch him and bring him to the vets (and maybe I can get into legal trouble?) I’ll keep an eye on him and I’ll bring him to the vets if he’s bleeding or looking extremely sick

Edit 2: forgot to mention but he clearly isn’t a feral cat, just a cat that his owners let go outdoor. I don’t support outdoor cats, but I know some cats are used to this lifestyle and locking them inside can stress them. I’m also not his owner so I can’t make that decision.",2025-04-05 18:45:38,4,AeraScreamer5,aww

They were hell on the piano and any other wood that had a sharp edge, but now I view the gnaw marks with love and nostalgia.

Quiet, low maintenance, cheap to feed, don't need walking like a dog, naturally use a litter box for pee. The pellets get dropped randomly here and there, but dry.",2025-04-18 13:19:12,2,solarguy2003,aww

I also do this with my 20-year-old kitty. She is my childhood cat, and she grew up as an indoor/outdoor cat. But 5 years ago, I took her as my own due to a lot of reasons, and she has been indoor only since. But I do take her out every now and then to experience the outside for a bit! Where we live now, there are too many strays, and my kitty would get into tussles with neighborhood cats that were also indoor/outdoor if they came in her yard. So, I am not risking it! Especially since she gets upset when she sees another cat near the window when she is looking outside.

When we lived in an apartment, I had cat proofed the balcony and let her lay out on the balcony. She really enjoyed it! I would love to get her a Catio or something so she can still experience the outdoors without me having to hold her every second. I tried a harness, but she absolutely despises those no matter how often I'd use it to help her get used to it. I also took her out in a pet stroller, but she would just meow the entire time and would stop the minute we got home. So, for now, she gets to go out while being carried.

She didn’t know how to snuggle. She didn’t know that I was going to love her and treat her like the princess she is! A couple days after I got her I was sitting by my van and scooped her up and she collapsed right into me like above. The camping neighbors saw and I head legit awwwwwssss She was tied up without food and water when she was found by a rescue and she had a shock collar on her to prevent her from barking. She had been a mama (side note, found out she LOVES kittens and is still a good mama to babies) I got sidetracked talking about my best friend. I will add some cute tax for your troubles.

He eventually stopped after we got her on continuous monitors and a pump; she still gets lows but not as severe and not as often.  He even kept “checking” on her every night for a good six months after I stopped my normal routine of going up and checking her blood at midnight.  He’s a good boy.

Any dog can be a service animal. Medical alert dogs are service animals and protected by the ADA. 
A service dog does not have to wear anything denoting that it is a service animal.

There is no recognized registry in the US. Any website offering papers are a scam. 

The ADA does not cover housing protections for ESA. That's under the Fair Housing Act. 

Service Animals do have extensive training often taking up to 2 years to be ready for public access work. ESA require no training at all and provide comfort just by existing..this is the main reason they are not granted public access rights.",2025-04-11 05:02:39,54,AuntieFox,aww

mmi7p82,1jwcc14,reddit,"Playing devils advocate, there is a highly likely chance this COULD be a legit service dog. The fact the dog is in a sling close to the persons chest, this could be a diabetic or seizure alert dog. The average person with a fake is going to place the dog in their arms or within something like a cart/stroller.

People tend to think service animals are the typical golden/lab, but any breed can be a service dog with proper training. It all depends on a dogs temperament!

People have made assumptions about my personal service dog (a doberman) only to be surprised to see him in action! It's all in the training and actions of the handler. :)",2025-04-11 03:27:43,143,DoodaSquad,aww

It's very common for people to have service animals specifically trained for medical alerts; they learn to alert their owner when they detect an oncoming seizure, changes in blood pressure and blood glucose levels, migraine alerts an more. 

Actually Chihuahuas have such a great sense of smell it actually makes them one of the best dog breeds for this task. Not all service dog owners have the same disability which means not all of them need a big dog.

mlgxrzw,1jrajk3,reddit,Your hamster is unhappy. I see you were previously using a standard wire crate that can be bought at pet stores. These are NOT ideal as hamsters need around 1-2 ft deep worth of bedding so they can burrow and hide! They should be kept in large glass tanks as well so they can’t squeeze out or injure themselves on the bars. Please look into a better solution as your hamster looks very stressed.,2025-04-05 00:59:27,2,uuusagi,aww

She knew EXACTLY what to do!  She stood stone still and let the mom cat check her out.  Took a while.  Finally Mom cat stepped aside and let my dog see the babies.  She kissed them all.  

From then on, she helped with those babies every single day.  It was relief to the mom.  Those kittens would line right up to the dog and wait their turn to be held down and licked all over.

Nicer than my boy! He is the alarm! From 5:30 onwards, sleep is not permitted (as daylight savings has done the thing and I was feeding him at 6, so he is being kind of generous). 

He will shove his face into mine and sniff my eyelids if I try to pretend to be in  deep sleep. He's too smart.  The whiskers and airpuffs are just too much!

He'll use every possible vocalisation, and is experimenting on what works best. 

He's only 8 months old! He's incredible!

He also likes to bring me treasures in my bed.

He brings his favourite balls and hides them in my sheets, and he's started picking up lost hair ties and putting them near my pillow! He's such a strange boy!",2025-04-25 00:19:19,1,Averander,aww

mjxrx27,1jkkii6,reddit,"I understand what everyone is saying on here about spaying your cats, but I would also like to bring up that some of us are first time cat owners, who picked up a kitten and didn't realize how young they start to reproduce. My first family cat(still alive) was six months old when she had her first litter, the family that we got her from said that they shouldn't be spayed until 8 months to a year; should we have done our own research rather than trusting blindly? Absolutely yes, but she was a tiny cat until her third year so it seemed right. Her first litter was 8 kittens, five of which stayed with us as we had a farm and they are all indoor/outdoor cats. The others we thoroughly vetted homes for, and kept tabs with them for a few weeks after rehoming to make sure they were being taken care of and not fed to snakes or being bullied by other cats in the households. The ones we kept were obviously spayed pretty young, to not end up with the same situation. But that first litter was mind-blowing to us that she had them so young. (She was also fixed a couple months after giving birth, as whatever research we did after that point indicated that she shouldn't be spayed too soon after giving birth.)

OP those are adorable bundles of fur there! I hope you are careful about the homes you send them to, and I AM BEGGING YOU NOT TO POST THEM ON CRAIGSLIST THEY WILL BE FED TO SNAKES IF YOU GO THAT ROUTE. (We tried craigslist at one point and everyone who contacted us turned out to be buying mice, rabbits, and kittens to feed to their snakes.) Have a photo we received from one of the new kitten families. Caught mid yawn with his new brother.

My momma and her kids also make heart. Poor momma is top left, a drawf and also somehow gave us 6 kittens while severely underweight. We had to bottle them since they were taking all her calcium. 6 kittens are hard to deal with, give momma some kitten milk to replenish her milk, also give her kitten food. Weigh the babies, and get them snipped or you will have another batch soon. Momma Kiwi went into heat 4 weeks after having kids, made our other cat very uncomfortable",2025-03-26 23:15:21,4,Flat-Limit5595,aww

It came up in a recent therapy session and I bawled my eyes out and dealt with it. Went outside to take a walk after and this hummingbird flew right up to me, flew in front of the path I was walking (like I had to stop walking cuz it was right there) and turned to face me, hovering in front of me. Then flew to my side, faced me and hovering. Then flew away.

The first is you are welcomed home and showered with affection. It will be as if you never were away. 

The second will be your cat will act mad at you, but ultimately revert to the first option. 

The third. Your cat has seen things. Known things. Experienced horrors your feeble human mind cannot fathom. The fuzzy ball was under the stove and you, human, abandoned your cat. You weren’t there to get it. You have returned here, acting like you didn’t abandon your cat to these horrors, but oh no, your cat remembers. It may simply treat you like a stranger. Or perhaps it will get revenge. But you will pay for what you have done. At least for a day or a few. Then we go back to option one.",2025-03-29 16:34:23,1,aznvjj,aww

mk6oag4,1jlviwt,reddit,"Cleo was truly one of a kind. She came into our lives later in hers, but she still managed to become our everything. She had lived a tough life before, but we’re so grateful we could give her the pampered, cozy, love-filled life she so deeply deserved in her final years. She discovered peanut butter and so many other foods and snacks with us. She was truly loved and pampered.

But don’t let her softness and grace fool you. Cleo had a fire in her. She had a passion for life like no other I’ve ever known. She ran two 250km races, trained with 40km runs daily for a month, gave birth to 6 pups (3 boys, 3 girls), and outlived them all. At 12, she tore her ACL and still bounced back without surgery. She was running, playing, jumping around like she was a pup again. She battled cancer, nearly lost that fight… and still won.

Even in her final moments, Cleo was full of energy and joy. She played, talked, and made us smile right till the very end, when she left us suddenly. We are grieving, of course. But more than anything, we are celebrating Cleo. Her strength, her boundless spirit, and the deep love and light she brought into our lives. We were the lucky ones to have known her, to have been loved by her, to call her family. Here’s to Cleo!

Join me in sending her lots of love in the great beyond, to Cleo von Ruschdahl - Princess of Bow Wow. May she have lots of peanut butter, get all the walks she wants and love to flood her heart forever.",2025-03-28 13:58:06,48,sehgalanuj,aww

Easy to take apart and reconfigure if the kitties get bored.

My kitties love it, and they also use it to get on top of curtain rods and built-in high shelves to extend the adventure 🙂 We have climbing facilities in every room now, including the bathroom. 

Recommended for amateurs lacking in carpentry skills, or wanting flexibility and versatility! You can even place these in front of windows for birdwatching.",2025-04-02 22:52:34,0,Srikandi715,aww

I got a garden cart from one of the big hardware stores.  I put an old blanket in the bottom for his comfort.  Each side could be flipped down so I could help him step up into it.  I would pull him to the trail near our house. Once there, I'd help him out so he could sniff around and walk at his slow pace. When I saw he was getting tired, I'd help him back in the cart.  Then I'd pull him for the rest of the 2 miles.  He and I both loved walks with our cart. He passed 15 years ago. I still have the cart and use it for gardening. My dogs since then haven't needed it.

Maybe it's just my lack of sleep last night fueling this though. 


Objectively the craftsmanship is legitimately good too so it's not even that it's a technically bad piece, lol. I love the detail you put in with the coloring and everything.
