At a former job I taught a PhD course for PhD students in AI on how stuff like memory hierarchies and GPU's work. I also wrote all the material in the form of a website. I have recently gone through it again for errors. It uses Rust, WGPU and WGSL, so there is no fiddling around with build systems or any need for Nvidia GPU's.

I hope someone can get some use out of it!",3,0.6,0,2025-04-01 17:54:12,http://numbersgobrrrr.com,TheNoiseBox

I'm just obfuscating the \`eor\` instruction by using matrix multiplication to make it harder to reverse engineer software that uses it.

I plan on doing this for more instructions to learn even more about ASM and probably end up writing gpu code lmfao *kill me*. I also wanted to learn how to do inline assembly in Rust so I implemented it in Rust too: [https://github.com/graves/thechinesegovernment](https://github.com/graves/thechinesegovernment)

The Rust program uses \[quickcheck\](https://github.com/BurntSushi/quickcheck) to to generative testing so I can be really sure that it actually works. I benchmarked it and it's like a couple of orders of magnitude slower than just an \`eor\` instruction but I was honestly surprised it wasn't worse.

All the code for both projects are available on my Github. I'd love inputs, ideas, other weird bit tricks. Thank you <3",3,0.8,0,2025-04-16 09:57:58,https://awfulsec.com/dinoxor.html,sqli

programming,1jy2kin,[DEVLOG] Razen Language – Now with VS Code Extension + Major Updates,"Hey folks,  
I’ve been building a small programming language called **Razen**, and I’m excited to share a big update. I’m 16, and this project started as a fun experiment — but it’s been growing steadily, and now it has its own **VS Code extension** to make working with it a lot more comfortable.

# What is Razen?

Razen is a lightweight, beginner-friendly language designed with flexibility and simplicity in mind. I wanted something that felt different from most traditional languages — more expressive, less rigid. It’s still in active development, but the idea is to make it both fun and functional.

# What’s New?

* **VS Code Extension** Now available with syntax highlighting and basic support. Makes writing Razen code way smoother.
* **New Features & Keywords** Added things like `razen:freestyle` for more open, dynamic logic. Also improved how variables work and cleaned up a lot of syntax.
* **Core Improvements** Performance is better, codebase is more organized, and things are just more stable overall.

# Try It Out

If you’re interested in language design, like playing with new ideas, or just want to see something built from scratch — give Razen a shot.

**GitHub:** [https://github.com/BasaiCorp/Razen-Lang](https://github.com/BasaiCorp/Razen-Lang)

Open to feedback, thoughts, or contributions. Still early days, but I’m proud of how far it’s come. Thanks for reading!",3,0.6,0,2025-04-13 07:54:53,https://github.com/BasaiCorp/Razen-Lang,GladJellyfish9752

So I built this tool and we've been using it successfully to solve those problems for a while, and I just got around to open-sourcing it.

Basically it handles creating and showing people messages whenever they install dependencies (or anytime you want), and tracks if they've seen a notice or not.

programming,1jrdz46,Live Asteroid Event Tracking with NASA API Integration,"Take command of your own virtual spy satellite with the Sentinel Spy Satellite Simulator - NASA API Edition! This interactive Python-based simulation puts you in the pilot’s seat of a high-tech orbital observatory, blending real-time NASA data with an immersive ASCII art experience. Powered by NASA’s open APIs (EPIC and NeoWs), this tool fetches live Earth imagery coordinates and asteroid proximity alerts, merging them seamlessly into a dynamic satellite control interface.

What It Does: • Real-Time NASA Data: Pulls live telemetry from NASA’s EPIC API (Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera) for authentic latitude,

longitude, and timestamps, plus NeoWs API for near-Earth object events. • Interactive Simulation: Control your satellite with real-time commands—scan sectors, transmit data, or repair systems—via intuitive keypress controls (S, D, C, T, R, Q). • Dynamic Events: Encounter randomized space hazards like debris fields or asteroid alerts (with real NEO data), requiring quick decisions to evade or intercept. • ASCII Art Display: Watch your satellite animate in retro-style ASCII art, with visual states reflecting health, scanning, transmitting, or repairs. • Persistent State: Tracks your satellite’s health, solar power, data collected, and missions completed, saved between sessions.

Features:

• NASA API Integration: Uses your NASA API key (or the included demo key) to fetch real data, with robust fallback to simulated telemetry if NASA’s servers are offline (e.g., during rare 503 errors).

• Sound Effects: Optional Pygame audio for boot-up, events, scans, and transmissions (requires sound files: boot.wav, event.wav, scan.wav, transmit.wav).

• Cross-Platform: Runs on Windows, macOS, or Linux with Python 3.x, requests, pygame, and colorama libraries.

• Customizable: Adjust frame speed, log missions to satellite\_log.txt, and tweak solar power regeneration rates.

• Educational & Fun: Perfect for space enthusiasts, coders, or educators wanting to explore NASA data interactively.

How to Use:

1.  Install Python and required libraries (pip install requests pygame colorama). 
2. Add your NASA API key (get one free at api.nasa.gov) or use the fallback mode.
3. Run the script, by putting satellite\_animation.py on desktop then run in terminal cd \~/Desktop hit enter then run python3 satellite\_animation.py

Whether you’re a developer curious about APIs, a space geek dreaming of orbit, or a creator looking for a unique project, this simulator delivers an out-of-this-world experience. Download now and launch your satellite into the cosmos!

Note: Includes full source code (Python) and setup instructions. Sound files sold separately or create your own. Support included via Gumroad messaging—reach out if NASA’s servers play hard to get!",2,0.57,0,2025-04-04 14:59:57,https://github.com/007tofreedom/Live-Asteroid-Event-Tracking-with-NASA-API-Integration.git,Holy_era

programming,1jrbdqn,Programming my e-commerce app to send custom metrics [OpenTelemetry],"I've been a user of default/ infra metrics for a while. Recently, for work, I  started playing with custom metrics when I was trying to wrap my head around OpenTelemetry. Used a simple e-commerce app to experiment and play around. 

Couple of insights,  
  
\- Ability to get tailored data. For example, number of users who leave mid-checkout, average cart-size at a point in time.  
  
\- I worked with Flask, and instrumenting it was a smooth process. Used the `opentelemetry-sdk` and `opentelemetry-api` to manually instrument the Flask app. While OpenTelemetry does provide auto-instrumentation for Flask, I needed custom metric generation inside business logic so opted for manual setup.  
  
\- I used SigNoz for visualisation, which doesn't charge extra for custom metrics, which was different from some other platforms. 

I've noted my findings in a blog and some examples \[with code\], give it a read, if you guys also use custom metrics or have plans to try it out!  
  
\[Disclaimer - I work at SigNoz\]  
  
It'd also be cool, if you can tell me how you have implemented custom metrics for any project/ work?

We talked about:

* Why his team replaced 70+ Java microservices with a single Rails monolith at a previous company—and what changed
* The performance and team culture gains that followed
* How he’s prototyping new fintech products in Ruby on Rails while maintaining a 20-year-old Java monolith managing $1.6T in assets
* Practical ways they’re using AI to navigate and document legacy systems
* Lessons in technical debt, psychological safety, and decision-making velocity

It contains:

1. 5-page Brief sent to candidates
2. Feedback from the offered candidate.

It provides guidance on how to make a good session, diving into detailed mindsets and behaviours.

I'm interested to hear unique experiences you've had in interviews:

1. Any activities or specific discussions you found were particularly engaging or beneficial to the process?
2. What feedback did you receive, after putting in what effort to get it?
3. How did your interviewers misinterpret you, or how you could have told a story better?
4. Anything else you wish was done to make both sides more prepared?",0,0.5,0,2025-04-22 13:40:06,https://towardsdatascience.com/beyond-the-code-unconventional-lessons-from-empathetic-interviewing/,promle
