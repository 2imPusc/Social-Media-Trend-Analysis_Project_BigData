I asked her what was wrong and she said the show was too scary. I asked her what was scary and she said the soup the character was eating was too hot and it burned his mouth.

movies,1jzb9wd,"April 11-13 Box Office Recap: On its second weekend, 'A Minecraft Movie' became the second biggest video game movie worldwide with $552 million. 'The King of Kings' over-performs projections, 'Warfare' opens decently, while 'The Amateur' and 'Drop' underwhelm.","https://preview.redd.it/5wk8mzvkhvue1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ba860803c8b374c941afb76643bcd1250c8556d

Despite four wide releases this weekend, none of them could fight ***A Minecraft Movie*** for the top spot. ***The King of Kings*** delivered Angel Studios' second biggest debut, while stuff like ***The Amateur*** and ***Drop*** failed to light things up, although ***Warfare*** had a solid start.

The Top 10 earned a combined $145.1 million this weekend. That's up a colossal 112.4% from last year, when ***Civil War*** debuted with A24's biggest opener.

***A Minecraft Movie*** was still at #1, adding $78.5 million. That's a 52% drop; not as bad as some other video game films, but it's also quite rough for a family flick. For contrast, ***The Super Mario Bros. Movie*** dropped 36.9% on its second weekend. Through 10 days, the film has earned $278.8 million, and it's still on track to finish with over $450 million domestically.

In second place, Angel Studios' ***The King of Kings*** earned $19.2 million in 3,200 theaters. That's the studio's second biggest debut, behind ***Sound of Freedom*** ($19.6 million). It's also the biggest debut for an animated bible film, surpassing ***The Prince of Egypt*** ($14.5 million), although ***Prince*** sold more tickets adjusted for inflation.

This is promising, and Angel Studios did a fantastic job with marketing. Not to mention having the film open with Easter around the corner, which should help it leg out. Like their prior films, they used the ""Pay It Forward"" feature, wherein someone can pay for a ticket for anyone else. The numbers reported are only those that were redeemed this weekend.

According to Angel Studios, 59% of the audience was female. Despite middling critic reviews, the audience loved it more: they gave it a rare ""A+"" on CinemaScore, indicating strong word of mouth. The film should leg out all the way to $60 million at the very least, especially with no animated competition till June.

In third place, 20th Century Studios' ***The Amateur*** debuted with $14.8 million this weekend. This debut is lower than the recent action film ***A Working Man*** ($15.5 million), although that had a more bankable name in the lead role.

While it's tough to get better numbers, one still thinks that the film could've opened higher than this. After all, Disney and 20th Century mounted an extensive campaign for the film, hoping to replicate other action film successes. But the thing with ***The Amateur*** is that it simply didn't offer anything new in the genre: a man loses his wife and sets out to get revenge. That's a genre that has been copied so many times, and it's tough to get excited for the 37th time it's played out. Even reviews (62% on RT) aren't really glowing.

According to 20th Century Studios, 57% of the audience was male, and 47% was 25 and over. They gave it a so-so ""B+"" on CinemaScore, which doesn't exactly inspire confidence. With options like ***Sinners*** and ***The Accountant 2*** coming up, it'd be a surprise if ***The Amateur*** got close to $40 million lifetime.

In fourth place, A24's ***Warfare*** debuted with $8.3 million in 2,670 theaters. That's A24's sixth biggest debut, and while far off from Alex Garland's ***Civil War*** ($25.5 million), it wasn't ever going to come close to those numbers.

All in all, it's a solid start for the film. War films have been finding success in theaters, although films revolving around Iraq War have been quite inconsistent; some have succeeded (***American Sniper*** and ***The Hurt Locker***), others not so much (***Green Zone*** and ***Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk***). A24 did a great job in emphasizing the film's plot points: a real-time story of soldiers in Iraq. Some fantastic reviews (94% on RT) certainly helped as well.

According to A24, 72% of the audience was male, and 53% was 25 and over. They gave it a great ""A–"" on CinemaScore, which is A24's best grade (their only other film to get this grade was ***The Iron Claw***). This is very encouraging, and suggests the film could leg out. For now, a $25 million domestic total is likely for ***Warfare***.

In fifth place, Universal/Blumhouse's ***Drop*** earned just $7.3 million in 3,085 theaters. That's below other Blumhouse titles like ***The Woman in the Yard*** ($9.3 million) and ***Wolf Man*** ($10 million). These numbers are also below director Christopher Landon's ***Happy Death Day 2U*** ($9.8 million), which was considered a disappointment back in 2019.

Even though the film cost just $11 million, it feels like Universal simply didn't know what to do with the film. Even though they premiered it at SXSW, where it earned great reviews (83% on RT), it feels like they didn't push it hard enough. Or maybe the concept: a woman asked to kill her date to save her family didn't entice audiences. It's not unreasonable to believe that had the film come out during Blumhouse's golden years, it could've opened with $20 million or more. Are audiences giving up on Blumhouse? 

According to Universal, 53% of the audience was female and 35% was in the 25-34 demographic. They gave it a middling ""B"" on CinemaScore; this is not bad, but it's not great either. With some competition on the way, it's unlikely it save some face. It'd be a surprise if the film came anywhere close to $25 million lifetime.

***The Chosen: Last Supper — Part 3*** earned $6 million this weekend. That's a 14% drop from ***Part 2*** ($6.9 million) last week. Across these 3 films, they have amassed $36.3 million domestically.

***A Working Man*** was hit hard by the newcomers. It dropped a steep 59%, adding $3 million this weekend. The film has earned $33.4 million so far, and it looks like it will struggle to hit $40 million domestically.

Disney's ***Snow White*** continues its freefall. The film now dropped 51%, adding just $2.8 million this weekend. Clearly, this film simply has no legs. The film has earned just $82 million so far, and it's guaranteed to finish below $90 million domestically. Terrible all around.

Ninth place belonged to Blumhouse's ***The Woman in the Yard***, which fell 54% and added $2 million this weekend. The film has earned $20.3 million so far, and it's finishing with something close to $25 million.

Rounding up the Top 10 was ***The Chosen: Last Supper — Part 2***. The film collapsed 86% this weekend, earning $961,861 this weekend. Through 10 days, it has earned $10.9 million so far.

#**OVERSEAS**

***A Minecraft Movie*** was still the #1 movie overseas. It added $79.6 million, taking its worldwide total to a colossal $552 million after just 2 weekends. The best markets are the UK ($39.8M), China ($20.3M), Germany ($18.9M), Mexico ($18.7M) and Australia ($18.5M). With this, it has already passed the ***Sonic*** movies to become the second biggest video game movie ever. The billion milestone is becoming more and more likely.

***The Amateur*** slightly over-performed projections overseas, earning $17.2 million for a $32.2 million worldwide debut. The best debuts were in France ($1.6M), the UK ($1.4M), Mexico ($1.4M), Germany ($1.1M) and Japan ($1.1M). Based on the pattern of other action films, the film should hit the $100 million milestone, although some rough competition will put a challenge to that.

***Snow White*** is nearing the end of its run worldwide. The film added just $4.7 million overseas, for a terrible $182.3 million worldwide total. Based on its drops, it looks like the film might go under $200 million worldwide. On a $270 million budget. Ouch.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Moana 2* | Nov/27 | Disney | $139,787,385 | $460,405,297 | $1,059,197,729 | $150M
*Novocaine* | Mar/14 | Paramount | $8,809,436 | $19,861,854 | $33,545,800 | $18M

- ***Moana 2*** has closed with $1.059 billion worldwide. Considering it was heading straight to streaming, that's a huge win for Disney Animation. Even if the quality of the film suffered as a result. The film debuted with a gigantic $389 million worldwide, which was the biggest debut for an animated title. But the film proved to be a bit front-loaded, especially for an animated film. A third film is inevitable, but Disney should really begin development as a film, not a half-assed TV show changed to a film.

- No pain, no gain. Paramount's ***Novocaine*** closed with just $33 million worldwide, failing to recoup its $18 million budget. That's eerily close the numbers earned by Jack Quaid's previous film, ***Companion***. Despite hitting #1 on its opening weekend, the film simply couldn't find an audience in the weeks afterwards. Quaid may be popular online, but that doesn't mean people are paying to watch him lead a movie.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

One film will try to challenge ***Minecraft*** for the top spot.

That film is Ryan Coogler's ***Sinners***, which stars Michael B. Jordan in a dual role in this horror title. Warner Bros. has backed up the film with an extensive marketing campaign, granting Coogler with his terms: the film's rights will revert back to him in 25 years. Coogler has had massive success with the ***Creed*** and ***Black Panther*** films, but this is his first major original film. And early reviews suggest he really cooked: it's sitting at a fantastic 100% on RT with 45 reviews so far. The big question is: will audiences support this?

Every time the usual ""what trope do you hate"" thread shows up, someone mentions the protagonist letting the villain live - bonus points if they mention that the protagonist killed henchmen on the way to the final fight. This sort of comment has become cliched in its own right.

To me, this has never bothered me; usually henchmen are killed in self-defense while the antagonist is typically disarmed and vulnerable.

Additionally: maybe killing the villain in cold blood is the ""right"" move to protect others, but I can't really fault the protagonist for not wanting to do that. I know I wouldn't want to have to deal with the psychological ramifications of that.

A $270 million movie couldn't win against Jason Statham.

***A Working Man*** over-performed projections and managed to steal the #1 spot, marking another win for Jason Statham. That was at the cost of ***Snow White***'s second weekend, which had a horrible drop amidst negative buzz and word of mouth. The rest of the newcomers was a mixed bag; ***The Chosen*** had a fantastic debut, ***The Woman in the Yard*** did okay, while ***Death of a Unicorn*** flopped.

The Top 10 earned a combined $68.4 million this weekend. That's off a poor 47.3% from last year, when ***Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire*** opened with $80 million.

Debuting #1, Amazon MGM's ***A Working Man*** earned $15.5 million in 3,262 theaters. This debut is almost on par with Statham and Ayer's previous film, ***The Beekeeper*** ($16.5 million).

All in all, this is a great start, and it's a sign that Statham can still attract audiences to theaters after more than 20 years in the business. The premise and the trailers were basically what you come to expect from Statham: an ""ordinary man"" with a job, who is actually a badass guy who kills bad guys. That's not different from other Statham titles but remember: if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Which might be why Statham is still having a lucrative career, and is also one of the very few actors who only make theatrical films and zero TV shows. No amount of mixed reviews (52% on RT) will change the audience's mind here; with Statham, you know what you're getting.

According to Amazon MGM, 60% of the audience was male and 37% of the audience was in the 18-34 demographic. It was a ""dad movie""; 42% of the audience was 45 and over. They gave it a middling ""B"" on CinemaScore, below ***Beekeeper*** (B+). It's unlikely it can hold as well as ***Beekeeper*** due to the amount fo competition, but it should still finish with over $45 million domestically. Statham already has another film, ***Mutiny***, ready for January 2026 and it should also perform well.

Oh, ***Snow White***.

You know, we're not gonna act like there was hope here. The opening weekend fell way below expectations and the film posted some mediocre weekdays, indicating that the film would not have legs. Yet we weren't prepared for the second weekend drop.

***Snow White*** earned $14.3 million this weekend. That's a brutal 66% drop, which is worse than any of the Disney live-action remakes. It's similar to the second weekend drop of ***Dumbo*** (60.4%), but that film had ***Shazam!*** ($53.5 million) and ***Pet Sematary*** ($24.5 million) as competition, while ***Snow White*** has almost nothing. This drop is a testament of negative buzz and word of mouth that has plagued the film.

Through 10 days, ***Snow White*** has earned a terrible $66.9 million so far. With ***Minecraft*** coming to take away its PLF screens, it will continue falling. One thing is clear from this: the film is gonna miss $100 million domestically, which is simply unbelievable. 

In third place, ***The Chosen: Last Supper — Part 1*** surpassed expectations. Playing in 2,478 theaters, the film earned a pretty great $11.7 million this weekend. By far the best debut in the ***Chosen*** franchise. The second and third parts will be released on April 4 and April 11, respectively.

Universal/Blumhouse's ***The Woman in the Yard*** debuted with $9.3 million in 2,842 theaters. That debut is not far off from Blumhouse's ***Wolf Man***, which disappointed with just $10.8 million back in January.

Considering the very low buzz and anemic pre-sales, this is a very solid numbers. And it's a testament to Blumhouse's strength that they can get a nothing film like this to debut to almost $10 million. Especially considering the weak reviews (43% on RT). Perhaps with very few horror choices, ***The Woman in the Yard*** managed to attract an audience that really wanted to go to the movies.

According to Universal, 55% of the audience was female, with its biggest demo women over 25 (31%). While it surpassed expectations, don't expect this to have a long life in theaters. It got a terrible ""C–"" on CinemaScore, which is the exact same grade as ***Wolf Man***. With competition on the way, it's unlikely ***The Woman in the Yard*** can make more than $25 million domestically.

In fifth place, A24's ***Death of a Unicorn*** flopped with just $5.7 million in 3,050 theaters. That's one of the worst debuts for a film playing in over 3,000 theaters, and it's another A24 misfire after the performance of ***Opus*** two weeks ago.

Comedy horrors can be a tough sell; A24's ***Y2K*** was another one of those which flopped back in December. Even with big names like Paul Rudd and Jenna Ortega attached, they have not found much success outside franchises. And despite the A24 name usually signaling quality, the reviews for the film were very middling following its SXSW debut (55% on RT).

According to A24, 51% of the audience was male and its biggest demo was women over 25 (29%). They gave it a poor ""B–"", which is quite bad for a comedy. With so many options on the way, ***Death of a Unicorn*** will probably finish below $15 million domestically. That'd be disappointing.

GKids re-released ***Princess Mononoke*** in 330 IMAX theaters this weekend, where it earned a pretty great $3.8 million. That took its lifetime total to $14.7 million.

***Captain America: Brave New World*** eased 27%, adding $2.9 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $196.6 million.

***Black Bag*** went from second place to eighth place, dropping 48% and adding $2.1 million this weekend. The film has earned $18.7 million, and it's gonna finish with around $22 million domestically.

***Mickey 17*** is nearing the end of its run. It dropped 47%, grossing $1.9 million. The film's domestic total stands at $43.6 million, and it's going to finish with around $47 million.

Rounding up the Top 10 was Paramount's ***Novocaine***, which continues its collapse. This time, it had a steep 60%, earning just $1.4 million this weekend. The film has amassed just $18.8 million, and it will make just $21 million at most. Practically the same amount as ***Companion***.

***The Alto Knights*** didn't save face on its second weekend. It collapsed 65%, earning just $1.1 million this weekend. Through 10 days, the film has earned an anemic $5.5 million, and it's gonna gonna close with less than $7 million domestically. Pathetic.

The documentary ***The Encampments*** (which follows the 2024 Palestine solidarity campus encampments at Columbia University and other pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses during the Gaza war) broke records despite playing in just one theater (the Angelika Film Center in New York). It earned $76,419 this weekend, which is the biggest per-theater average for a documentary. It will continue expanding in a few weeks.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Snow White*** was still the biggest Hollywood entry, but it added just $22.1 million overseas. And that took its worldwide total to just $142.7 million after two weeks. The best markets are the UK ($8.7M), Mexico ($6.9M), Italy ($6.6M), France ($5.5M) and Brazil ($4.5M). Very brutal all around. With the way it's dropping, the film won't much further than $200 million worldwide. Hell, if ***Minecraft*** surprises, it could go sub $200 million. At a $270 million budget, that's a flop for the ages.

***A Working Man*** debuted with $16.6 million overseas, for a pretty good $32.1 million worldwide debut. The best debuts were in China ($2.9M), Germany ($1.4M), Australia ($1.1M), Mexico ($1.1M), and the UK ($867K). With so many markets still left, this should get to $100 million worldwide easily.

***Mickey 17*** added $5.2 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $120.9 million.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Sonic the Hedgehog 3* | Dec/20 | Paramount | $60,102,146 | $236,115,100 | $491,115,100 | $122M

- ***Sonic the Hedehog 3*** has closed with a fantastic $491 million worldwide. While it was later surpassed by ***Mufasa*** in daillies, the film is not a loser in the slightest. It's hard to be disappointed at a franchise where each film makes more than the one prior. Paramount already found their next big franchise, to the point that they already scheduled a fourth film for March 2027. That one should definitely hit $500 million.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

After years stuck in development hell, ***A Minecraft Movie*** is finally hitting theaters. The film stars Jason Momoa, Jack Black, Danielle Brooks, Emma Myers, and Sebastian Hansen, and follows four misfits who are pulled through a portal into a cubic world that thrives on imagination, having no choice but to master the world while embarking on a quest with an expert crafter named Steve. The trailers have been... quite terrible, to say the least. But despite that, the popularity of ***Minecraft*** is just too big that families will probably still watch it. Let's just hope the final film is less painful than its trailers.

movies,1k5dqo6,"Don Bluth's All Dogs Go To Heaven (1989) never ceases to be a emotional experience, especially when you realize the tragic backstory for some of the scenes","Judith Barsi, the child actress who voiced Anne-Marie, was killed by her dad right after she did the voice-work for the movie. 

The last scene of Charlie (Burt Reynolds) saying goodbye to Anne-Marie, Reynolds' teary voice can be heard because it was real, the actor kept breaking down whenever he voiced his lines as he had to hear the voice of a dead child telling him how much she loved him. 

Judith Barsi struggled to sing the song, [Soon You'll Come Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSMJTSKXtLs), because of the abuse at home and how she related to the song. She broke down crying and they ended up using another girl to dub Barsi's singing. 

The movie itself is a moving and solid picture. I don't think Burt Reynolds getsw enough credit on how good he was in this voice acting role. He even showed he could sing. I like his duet with Melba Moore. 


I just adore Don Bluth and I wish he had made more movies.",624,0.91,36,2025-04-22 18:31:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1k5dqo6/don_bluths_all_dogs_go_to_heaven_1989_never/,CinephileCrystal

movies,1jsqdg8,The Secret Of NIMH is probably the single greatest American work of animation,"It's America's answer to Hayao Miyazaki, and I personally prefer it to Miyazaki. I grew up as an anime kid with a strong bias against anything Disney, and it was partially because of movies like this that surpass anything they've ever made tenfold. It blows my mind that Don, (in my opinion) would never again create a work of cinema anywhere near as compelling as The  Secret Of NIMH. I can't think of an other animated movie like it. I consider it to be the greatest children's movie ever made.

The sheer depth of the characters and their relationships, colors, situations, the densely layered and imagined environments the characters live in. The theme music. Back plot and narrative of events we never see that unfolded just before the start of the movie, and connect with the events during the course of the movie. The dark and violent scenes meant to show children the ugliness of blind greed. The mystery element of the necklace, and especially the animation. There's no doubt these are the most expressive and human feeling animal characters ever in a film. I have no idea how they were able to animate them that way. Amazing to see these mice and rats move, speak and behave exactly like human beings. All of the characters are deeply thought out, and balance perfectly against one another. The movie, among many other things, is an allegory of how corrupted, powerhungry people hold down the struggling and the poor. Sure, familiar tale, especially in animation, but it's done so flawlessly in this movie. I feel terrible for any fan of animation who has never seen this. You MUST watch it. It's one of the greatest films I've ever seen, and I feel so lucky that I got to experience it as a child. I remember it moved me to tears even then. I can't believe this is the same guy who made stinkers like Titan AE and A Troll In Central Park.

movies,1jl66oi,Lethal Weapon 4 is a good example on how to handle a forced unnecessary sequel and make it enjoyable,"We all know that feeling, right? When Hollywood milk too much a franchise and you rolls your eyes because there too much sequels and they are kind of useless. Nevertheless, Lethal Weapon 4 is an exception. That movie is kind of underrated but ""full"" of quality. It's a perfect example on how to make a good forced-sequel-that-nobody-asked-for.

Firstly and important point, it acknowledge the aging of the actors (and therefore, their characters) and even allows them to live an evolution. The best thing I suppose is the moment when Riggs use the famous ""I'm too old"" line from Murtaugh, which is a very logical move. But it also keep every running gags and codes of the previous movies to not stray too far from this franchise's nature (this is good too, to not lost the hardcore fans imo) while in the same time, showing new things to still give its own identity to this fourth sequel.

The Triad is an interesting new antagonist and we are even seeing the international debut of a young rising star (Jet Li). I am also kind of surprise by the final fight scene because of various aspect : it's a little more violent than what we are used to and throught this it also cemented the bromance/alchemy of Riggs and Murtaugh. It's also not a duel but a... truel? definitely not what we are used to in an action movie or a buddy cop movie. Last note, I love so much how Murtaugh and Riggs move in different direction (like a cross) when the fight is about to happen, it's very martial movie-like.

Thanks to all this, LW 4 made you feel like you are watching friends or a family that you have been seeing for years. The last scene is the best and almost pretty meta since it totally made you feels like you are a part of the Lethal Weapon family. So, kudos to the late Richard Donner and the whole crew.",211,0.87,101,2025-03-27 15:10:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jl66oi/lethal_weapon_4_is_a_good_example_on_how_to/,CitizenTony

movies,1jxdz8a,Perspective change on the truman show,"
Just finished rewatching The Truman Show for the first time since I was a teenager, and I'm genuinely stunned by how prophetic this film was.

Back in 1998, the idea of someone's entire life being broadcast 24/7 seemed like pure science fiction. Now we literally have people voluntarily documenting every aspect of their lives for strangers online.

The scene where Truman realizes patterns in his world (same people walking past at the same time) reminds me of how recommendation algorithms keep showing us the same content. And when he tries to leave town but encounters obstacles? That's basically what happens when we try to disconnect from social media - there's always something pulling us back in.

The most haunting part was when Truman asks ""Was nothing real?"" That question hits harder now when we're all curating these perfect online versions of ourselves.

Anyone else revisit older films that seem to predict our modern reality in ways that weren't obvious when they were released?

movies,1jjapgs,The Deer Hunter is devastating and I haven't seen another film quite like it,"This has been one of my favorite films since I was 18 years old, it hit me at just the right age I think. I love this movie. I don't find it slow at all. I love the pace of the opening and the wedding sequence. It feels like a documentary. It gives us time to get comfortable with the characters as real human beings, not just movie characters. The acting is so naturalistic. Every scene in Clariton feels very much like an Altman ensemble film with its wandering camera, overlapping dialogue and the very naturally realistic acting style. The characters aren't given big monolgues to express themselves, they do it all in a look. Character interaction and quick expressive moments build the characters and their stories without pandering to the audience. It's an exceptionally subtle piece of filmmaking. The fact that Michael and Nick are in love with the same woman is pretty clearly set up in the wedding sequence. Nick is very often framed with a stuffed deers head on the wall, foreshadowing his death by ""one shot"" later in the 


The film deals with so many themes that are crystallized in the famous POW sequence. The gambling over death defying acts of masculinity is set up earlier in the film with Michael and Nick gambling over the car race. Their focus on guns and the 'one shot' philosophy is set up during the deer hunting sequence. The idea of never leaving a friend behind is set up when they jokingly leave John the bartender on the side of the road when driving to hunt the deer. Michael's use of a flamethrower is set up in the opening scene when he's making steel in the hellish factory. The death of SPOILERS Nicky is foreshadowed by his repeated framing with a stuffed deers head and a photo of JFK.

There is quite a bit more subtle foreshadowing and callbacks throughout the film but I'll stop here. It's a very subtle, emotional, beautifully atmospheric small town epic. It feels like a novel that gets better on repeat viewings.

It's ballsy for a film to do this to this extent and I wish more films would go this far.

I have been thinking about it recently, and have been wanting to rewatch it. Things i remember about it:

\- This was on the TV like 7 or 6 years ago.

\- Think Toy Story but live action (with actors on set yk) and the bad toys were real bad and had a grudge against the main character.

\- There was an army of toys marching up a river bank.

\- They had killed someone....? I think fire was involved (im not 100% sure tho)

\- The toys were going to atack the main characters.

\- It was either an action, or a horror.

\- May have been a series as it may have ended on a cliff-hanger (for the next episode) or there was an ad break idk.

  
I would really want to rewatch this.

The script (by Zemeckis and Gale) is still taught at film schools today as an absolutely brilliant example of Three Act structure and how to set-up/payoff. 

So tell me - were you around in ‘85 to see it theatrically? Did a parent show it to you? How do you think the film plays today? For me it works just as well and I even occasionally find things I’d never noticed before.

movies,1jzv8sj,"For as much as Tom Cruise loves to push his limits of doing stunts, I would love to see him do a modern Buster Keaton style stunt comedy.","Buster Keaton being famous for his courage and willignness to pull of some crazy stunts, giving us some of the best slapstick and stunt comedy films ever made. To this date there hasn't been anybody nearly at his level (and courage) to pull off some of the things he did. 

The closest to him currently is Tom Cruise who has become well known (among other things) for his own willingness to pull of some crazy stunts. As the Mission Impossible series has shown us, as well as Top Gun and other films, Tom Cruise is always pushing his own limits and challenging his own capabilities in his stunt work, all for the sake of cinema. 

For that reason, I would LOVE to see a modern Buster Keaton style slapstick film, feeling like Tom Cruise is the only one with the capability to pull it off. What made Buster Keaton films so great was both the stunts and also the dry deadpan humor. Keaton's stoicism to the chaos around him is something we've seen with Leslie Nielsen in Airplane/Naked Gun. 

Leslie Nielsen experienced a career renaissance that made him a household name in comedy, despite having no comedic chops himself. Simply because he used deadpan humor and being the every man who pretends like everything is normal as the chaos unfolds around him.

This is where I think Tom Cruise would be perfect to do a Buster Keaton style film. As an action star Tom Cruise isn't well known for his comedic chops, but he doesn't need to be. He can maintain the deadpan seriousness and stoicism of Buster Keaton and Leslie Nielson reacting to the craziness happening around him and showing off his stunting capabilities in increasingly absurd situations.

A) The term is immediately followed up by the definition:

“Yeah, must’ve been an earthquake.”

OPPENHEIMER

“It’s a kangaroo court with a predetermined outcome!”

B) Just saying the same thing twice:

MORBIUS

“It’s lethal to bats … but deadly to humans.”

C) Saying out loud what is clearly already happening:

PEARL HARBOR

“I think World War 2 just started…” 

Generic example:

*gunshots are heard and car windows shatter*

“They’re shooting at us!”

Gimme your best.

Edit: Great examples, everyone. Getting a kick out of reading these.

Clearly, I should’ve added a fourth category:

D) Comically redundant *on purpose*

Just to defend my Morbius quote: yeah I stretched it as far as the category goes, but this is still repetitive as hell in spirit. Of course something can be lethal to one animal and not lethal to another, but the wording makes two clauses where there should have been only one.

What I love about this movie is how Marge (Frances McDormand) and her husband never bring work home.

Carl (Steve Buscemi) calls Jerry (William Macy), says there’s a problem. Jerry asks, “How’s Jean?” Carl pauses and goes, “Who’s Jean?”
Killed me. 
He didn’t even know the name of the woman he kidnapped.

All the ‘yeaaaah’’s always stuck. The accents also did play a huge part in making the movie so loveable. 
They should do a serious sequel with Scotty (the son) and how he grows up all messed up.

movies,1k4bbq0,"What's one movie scene that just sticks in your head, even years later? What makes it so memorable?","Hey folks,

You know those movie scenes that just get stuck in your brain and you can't shake them? Not necessarily the best scene ever, or from your favorite movie, but just a single, specific moment that pops up in your head out of nowhere, even years after you've seen it.

What's that one scene for you? What movie is it from, and what's so unforgettable about it? Was it something shocking, something beautiful, something weird, or just a really powerful moment?

For me, it's definitely a few moments from Annihilation. But one that really messed with me was when they get deeper into the Shimmer and you start seeing how the mutations are blending everything together. Like those flowers that had human-like features, or even the way the crew members started to get mixed up with the environment and each other. That whole visual of nature and people merging in this bizarre, unnatural way was so creepy and unsettling. It really made you think about what was happening in that zone. That whole idea of things losing their boundaries and becoming something else… yeah, that sticks with you. Coming from a person with plant biology background may be a reason. 

What's that one scene for you? Share the movie and what made that specific moment so unforgettable. Let's hear those scenes that are just stuck to your memory!",160,0.87,467,2025-04-21 11:35:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1k4bbq0/whats_one_movie_scene_that_just_sticks_in_your/,Polyglotpen
movies,1juirmg,Kelly LeBrock: The Woman in Red whose career never reached the promising start she got,"I like Kelly LeBrock. She had a unique look and when you saw The Woman in Red, you couldn't take your eyes away from her. She emulated Marilyn Monroe but made it her own. Sure, it stretched credibility that she'd ever be interested in grumpy, aging Gene Wilder but that movie was always a male fantasy. 

That's what LeBrock was, a male fantasy. I thought she was a good actress but men were mesmerized by her body and iconic lips. She then did Weird Science, playing a virtual woman, created by two geeks, and that film became a instant cult classic. In the 80s, she was the perfect woman. 

So what happened? Two words: Steven Seagal. She married the famed martial arts movie star, after working together in Hard to Kill, and the troubled marriage lasted 9 years. 

She barely acted but while her film career went up in flames, she did turn to a good cause, helping the Terminally ill by being a spokesperson for Club Carson, a foundation helping children with cancer. 

A good woman, her film career didn't rise to the potential she had, but she has used her fame for a worthy cause and this is what matters the most. 

And she's still stunning.",164,0.84,57,2025-04-08 17:07:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1juirmg/kelly_lebrock_the_woman_in_red_whose_career_never/,CinephileCrystal

movies,1jirixr,"""Flow"" - How the Cat-Whale dynamic resonated with me after my mom's suicide","I finally watched Flow yesterday at one of the last screenings here in France, and feel so spoken to. As someone who has lost a lot of people these past few years and felt responsible for the actions of others, the theme of people entering and leaving your life during their own journey gave me a lot of parallels.

But the Cat's relationship to the Whale really resonated with me, in my heart before I could explain it. I first saw this dynamic as a ""help where you can and accept when you can't"" moral:

>The Whale saving the Cat, while literally lifesaving for the Cat was just a bit of effort on the Whale's part, maybe just an afterthought in its day. However, this situation could only be manufactured through the absurd scenario of the flood, where Whale just happened to have the skills needed to help. When the flood ends, the Cat is the only one with the skills/intelligence to get the rope out of the tree and help save the animals on the boat. When the Cat finds the Whale again -beached in a forest, another absurd scenario-, there is nothing he can do other than comfort the Whale while it dies. We aren't all built with the right tools for every scenario, and some problems are beyond our means, we are not able to save everyone, even if that person had previously saved us and we feel indebted to them. A very stoic moral that preaches forgiving yourself.

But I couldn't figure out why it was so powerful to me, so I went for a walk under the nighttime drizzle after the movie. I then realized that I saw the Cat & Whale's relationship as that of me and my mother, who lost her battle with bipolar disorder almost 2 years ago. 

>In addition to saving the Cat, the Whale was following the boat, serving as a source of comfort in a sea of danger. If something goes terribly wrong, the Whale would be there to save the Cat again. My mother, and most people's parents, was that source of comfort, and it's thanks to her that I am alive today, simply by virtue of being her child. She followed my boat as I sailed through the troubled waters of divorced parents, being moved as a child to a country whose language I did not speak, and through any other challenges in my life.

>I have spent the past 2 years guilting myself since I found her dead. With a better son, she would still be alive -despite the fact that I had already stopped 2 of her attempts and was the only thing left giving her joy in life-. And while that may be partly true simply due to the butterfly effect, for the most part, I have to accept that the external circumstances (bipolar disorder & suicidal / a beached whale in the middle of the forest) were far too overwhelming. 

If I watched ""Flow"" and could ""forgive"" the Cat for not being able to save the Whale, then I have to forgive myself for not being able to save my mom.",160,0.84,28,2025-03-24 14:09:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jirixr/flow_how_the_catwhale_dynamic_resonated_with_me/,Coolnave

movies,1jse0uz,Man I miss New Line Cinema when it was its own separate studio.,"Back in the 90’s to mid 2000’s  they were one of the most balliest studios in Hollywood that took chances on quirkier movies like Austin Powers, The Mask, or Elf that even back then the other majors would’ve never done. And give up and coming directors like David Fincher and Paul Thomas Anderson their breakouts. Heck they manage to greenlight all three Lord of the Rings in one go. 

They were like the equivalent to a punk rebel teenager  doing movies their way 

Unfortunately that’s what killed the studio after Return of the King putting whatever out there and most of them were box office failures or absolutely terrible like Son of the Mask or Hoot and  then spending $180 million on The Golden Compass which bombed so hard that Time Warner decided to it was enough  to absorb it into Warner Bros. 

And now it’s just a small label under WB  that makes some horror movies and 2 or 3  movies in other genres  that’s kind of forgotten about within a couple of months. 

But at least WB still keeps that legacy going but I do have the feeling in 5 years they'll eventually retire the name.

I feel like New Line's spiritual successor is Lionsgate where they still make smaller budgeted quirkier movies that other studios wouldn't dare to do. ",160,0.87,36,2025-04-05 21:21:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jse0uz/man_i_miss_new_line_cinema_when_it_was_its_own/,gearwest11

Here's a bunch of cover art from VHS store horror movies I compiled, FWIW: [https://imgur.com/gallery/vhs-horror-movie-cover-art-that-enthralled-captivated-you-youth-from-late-70s-to-early-90s-9L046CH](https://imgur.com/gallery/vhs-horror-movie-cover-art-that-enthralled-captivated-you-youth-from-late-70s-to-early-90s-9L046CH)

The one film I saw because ""cute robots"" was **Silent Running by Douglas Trumbull**, starring Bruce Dern. Almost feels like a spiritual ancestor of High Life in one sense, but like things that made you who you are... Fred Rogers, Carl Sagan, etc... this film gave me a presence of mind about nature that I learned way too young. It's at the core of how I behave and treat this planet... 

But it shattered and broke me. I know Huey's forest is still out there, but when Louie died, and when Dern says goodbye to the robots... I mean, it was just pure trauma for my child mind.

I wonder what other people saw that just anchored into their soul or heart, or became the basis for their fears or weird stuff, all because you saw it too young?",149,0.89,682,2025-04-04 22:04:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jro1ng/what_movies_did_you_see_when_you_were_way_too/,unclefishbits

Starring Alicia Vikander, Elizabeth Olsen, Himesh Patel, and Minnie Driver,  the film had its World Premiere at TIFF 2024, and played at the Zurich Film Festival, BFI London Film Festival, and more. The film is my feature directorial debut, but I've been directing music videos (like some for Skrillex, Drake, Pharrell Williams, and Travis Scott), commercials, and shorts until now. More on the film:

THE ASSESSMENT follows Mia (Olsen) and Aaryan (Patel), a successful couple who hope to become parents in a near future where resources are extremely limited and the government keeps firm control over reproduction. They are assigned an assessor named Virginia (Vikander), who moves into their home for seven days to evaluate whether they deserve to move forward in their parenting journey. What Mia and Aaryan are hoping is a routine test quickly unravels into a psychological nightmare, forcing them to question the very foundations of their society and what it truly means to be human.

Incantation – Loved the atmosphere and presentation, especially how it played with curses and audience interaction. It was really well done… but honestly, not that scary.

Longlegs – Cinematography and storytelling were top-notch, and I was hooked the whole time. But that ending... when it boiled down to *""the devil made me do it""*, it just killed it for me. I’m not into supernatural explanations that feel like a cop-out.

Gonjiam: Haunted Asylum – This one was solid, especially for found footage. Great pacing, great use of the setting. I want more like this. (But it wasn't scary at all)

The ones with **P2W (Pay-to-Win)** advantages, or maybe even avatars controlled by the **devs/admins** running the whole show, walking among us **IRL**?

It's a properly chilling thought that these movies planted in my brain all that time ago, and it genuinely still gives me goosebumps just thinking about it.

Anyone else have a movie do this to them? Left you with a deep unease or a creepy thought that revisits you long after you watched it? Which ones were they?

**TL;DR:** **The Truman Show** and **Westworld** still creep me out years later, making me wonder if we're NPCs and the rich/powerful are the real players/admins.

I re-watched it last night and you know how there are movies you saw as a kid and you revisit them as adults and they end up sucking. 

Not The NeverEnding Story. I still get emotional in the right parts, I still have my heart pumping when the score by Klaus Doldinger comes up, I'm still in awe at the VFX and sets and the movie is so deep, it's got a genuine message which continues to be current to this day. Gmork's explanation, for one.

The performances are superb. Noah Hathaway is extraordinary, he carries most of the film, conveying his acting with great committment. Barrett Oliver is believable as a boy dealing with loss and bullying and fully wrapped in the book. Tami Stronach's Child Empress is a brief but memorable presence. Everybody does a good job. Sure, some parts are a bit off but even back then, I caught the scenes I found cringy and I still loved the film.

I choose a genre I feel like exploring that evening, I exclude 1-2 ""tags"", and then look for a movie that gets my attention based on the title or something similarly minor. It's not about the ratings or notable actors, but just the concept.

That's how I stumbled upon The Endless(2017), which remains one of the most bizarre but also genuinely intriguing movies I've ever seen. I knew nothing about it prior to watching, read no reviews or opinions, and now I can totally recommend it to anyone interested.

And if you indeed are curious, it's a relatively slow and atmospheric horror that touches upon the topic of cults, the people involved in them, and those who manage to get out.

Anyway, what about you? What are some movies that you found by accident that turned out to be good/interesting/thought-provoking?

Lithgow plays each of these personas with a distinct sense of extreme emotion, be it shyness or weakness or playful sadism. His performance keeps changing it up whenever a persona takes over, at one point he assumes a female persona, and Lithgow always had a bit of feyness in his acting which perfectly allows him to convincingly add that extra layer.

We were blown away by your support and enthusiasm around this game, and we've been working hard to make the changes you all requested.

We've built these features based on your feedback:

* Ability to see the solutions to previous games
* Sort actors & movies alphabetically and chronologically
* Hovering over or selecting an image will show the movie title/actor name.
* We also made [TV Circuit](http://wfhgames.com/tv-circuit) after getting a lot of requests for it. I think it tends to be a bit harder than Cinema Circuit.

We can't thank you enough for being a part of this. The game is definitely much better as a result of all your ideas. We'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback if you have more!",115,0.81,12,2025-04-14 17:36:42,http://wfhgames.com/cinema-circuit,flurp41

However it came out when anti-war sentiment was at an all time high and it flopped hard, I have seen figures stating it took no more than £100,000 when it was released at the cinema.

movies,1jkfptq,'The Assessment' was really good and it's a shame no one is seeing it,"So this just came out last weekend, I had never even heard of it until the week before when I saw a trailer in the theater and thought it looked intriguing, come to find out it made all of $152K this weekend from less than 300 theaters. I'm kind of baffled as to why; this has a really strong visual presentation, three recognizable actors giving very good performances, and a really compelling hook. The only reason I could imagine it not clicking with a bigger audience is because it gets darker than I expected, but I'm shocked that this seemingly just slipped completely under the radar, especially because it seems like the kind of movie this sub will inevitably come across as a 'hidden gem' in the next few years.

There's definitely an obvious comparison to be made to *Ex Machina* just in the fact that they're both seven day sci-fi experiments set in a futuristic location starring Alicia Vikander, but these are very, very different films beneath the surface. There's a LOT more going on in this film than I expected, and one thing I really have to say is that it feels like the kind of premise that in the hands of another filmmaker could've very easily become one-note or repetitive, but I never felt as though this did. I was really surprised how much depth they managed to give to all three main characters, and how many themes they managed to explore in ways that actually felt meaningful.

There's definitely some visual elements and ideas that feel as though they were inspired by other films (namely one room in the house that feels very reminiscent of *Blade Runner 2049*), but there's still something really fresh about this that feels like it's coming from a new voice.

If you have a chance, I'd definitely recommend checking it out. I'm trying to avoid giving anything away because I do feel as though it's best experienced mostly cold, but I also expect it'll only be in theaters for another few days.

movies,1jy9fkv,The Lives of Others (2006) is incredible,"The Lives of Others, or *Das Leben der Anderen*, is a German movie that came out to a lot of critical acclaim in 2006, and eventually won the Best International Film Oscar over Pan's Labyrinth. I finally got around to watching it, and ended up loving it. Highly recommended to anyone looking for an intelligent, mature historical drama with fantastic performances

The summary is as follows: In 1983 East Berlin, dedicated Stasi officer Gerd Wiesler begins spying on a famous playwright and his actress-lover Christa-Maria. Wiesler becomes unexpectedly sympathetic to the couple, and faces conflicting loyalties when his superior takes a liking to Christa-Maria.

While the above makes the movie sound like a spy thriller, it really is more of a character study with social commentary. There are some thriller-esque elements to it, and the movie *can* be pretty tense at times - this isn't really the focus however, as it's more concerned with making a point about the impact of a political and socially repressive regime on its people, whether they're against it or are complicit in supporting it. 

The performances are what really make this such a great experience. Ulrich Mühe as Wiesler is fantastic, especially considering how restrained and low-key the role is. He expresses so much with just his eyes and facial expressions alone. It almost feels like he created this entire person on screen without saying a single word about his personality, because pretty much all of his dialogue is strictly about the work he does. Sebastian Koch and Martina Gedeck are really good in their roles as well.

This is definitely a slow-burn narrative that grows in power and impact as it moves along. Honestly, for the first hour or so, I thought it was just ""good"" - well-acted and directed, but not really exceptional in any way. But halfway through, it hits another gear, the screws are tightened around the characters and it gradually transforms into a tense, anxiety-inducing story before eventually ending up as a bittersweet tragedy. 

I also have to applaud the ending, as it's one of the most cathartic and emotional conclusions to a movie I've seen in a while. The scene in the bookstore, with Wiesler going ""it's for me"" and the camera freezing on his face for a while - just beautifully done.

Yes it's a lot of physical gags. But... It's executed so well. I don't know how any of the actors filmed that movie with a straight face especially with any scene involving Brendan Frasier because he's so over the top. The humor as an adult is great because so much shit flew over my head as a kid. The 4th wall breaking is also great.

movies,1jzpi3y,"Boiling Point (2021) pulls off a 90 minute single take and is probably my favorite movie with this ""gimmick""","Decided to watch this after being super impressed with director Philip Barantini's work on the Netflix show Adolescence. The way he stages and blocks his actors in order to pull off this technical feat is nothing short of brilliant. The movie is incredibly tense, set in a single night in a busy restaurant, and the camerawork massively contributes to this overwhelming sense of dread that lingers over every scene. Stephen Graham and Vinette Robinson are absolutely magnetic as the head chef and sous chef, Robinson especially absolutely kills it during this one scene where she delivers the most realistic frustrated monologue I think I've ever watched (I think she flubs a couple lines but it added to the sense of realism, I often stumble over my words when angry, too). I've seen a few films that try this same gimmick - Birdman is fantastic, Victoria is awesome, 1917 is masterful. But while those movies are technical marvels in their own rights and maybe manage to pull off some flashier camera moves, none of them made me feel as claustrophobic and tense as this one. The simple, familiar setting, the naturalistic dialogue where people talk over each other and fumble their words, the sound design emphasizing the bustle of a busy restaurant. All of it gels into a single 90 minute heart attack, in the spirit of the Safdie Brothers.",90,0.78,63,2025-04-15 11:30:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jzpi3y/boiling_point_2021_pulls_off_a_90_minute_single/,letsgopablo

movies,1k0wubp,Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is about breaking the cycle and growing instead of getting into another one,"I often heard the opinion that the last scene of the movie is a subtle hint of how Joel and Clem get into another cycle of erasing themselves. And while I understand the logic of why people read it like this, I still feel that something is off with that interpretation.

If you didn’t know, in the [original](https://collider.com/eternal-sunshine-of-the-spotless-mind-original-ending/#:~:text=Eternal%20Sunshine%20of%20the%20Spotless%20Mind%27s%20original%20script%20had%20a,from%20a%20more%20cynical%20perspective) script the ending is a scene 50+ years after where Clem erases Joel for the 15th time while Joel leaves her audio messages asking why she's ignoring him, and Mary is assisting Clem.

It’s just that initially in the director’s mind, the movie was supposed to be a little more realistic and gritty. If we look at a few deleted scenes, we learn and see more of Naomi’s character, previous Joel’s girlfriend whom he mentions at the beginning of the movie. I think they’ve cut the crucial [scene](https://youtu.be/ovxHfv8CR0s?si=e_yjpfzwmLCo1peq) of Joel and Naomi’s breakup, where Naomi highlights to Joel that ""the thing is, whatever you think it is you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off - you're still Joel with the same problems"". I think this scene is crucial to understanding the difference between Joel's character before and after the erasure process.

When we see Lacuna Inc. for the first time, it seems like a fully legitimate business that's been functioning successfully for some time already, and there's not much to go wrong with the procedure. But the thing is, they are failing big time with Joel, Clem, and Mary, all at the same time.

With Clem, it goes wrong when creepy Patrick tries to stage ""love"" by using the things Joel was doing and saying before the erasure, and it seemingly rubs Clem off. With Joel, it goes wrong when he literally tries to stop the erasure process and tries to hide Clem in his deepest traumatic memories, and they erase Clem with the memories that weren't supposed to be erased at all.

And especially wrong it goes with Mary, who at first is the most enthusiastic of all about erasing memories. Suddenly she gets the real disgusting taste of it when she learns that she erased memories of her previous affair with Dr. Mierzwiak. And even more, in the [alternative](https://youtu.be/rb5R2MsQkxI?si=GQ6DzF-zYQpe4wPw) deleted scene Mary was supposed to learn that Mierzwiak got her pregnant and also convinced her to have an abortion before erasing her memory. Imagine what a shock this is for a character, to learn that you had an abortion, and don't even remember that.

But still, it's Joel at the center of the story, the main accent of the story is on Joel, how he behaves, and how he interprets things.

People love to point out that after the erasure process, Joel goes to Montauk again, and repeats the same steps... But he is not. This is a different Joel after the erasure.

If you really compare Joel before and after the erasure, you'll notice the real difference. Let's break it chronologically:

\- Joel meets Clem in Montauk, and they spend some time together. But then when Clem suggests spending more time together and going crazy, Joel freaks out and runs off. He later regrets running off, as he explains it while he's in his mind.

>I don't know. I felt like a scared little kid. I was like... It was above my head. I don't know. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation, I think. You said ""So go"" with such disdain, you know?

It's the very first case when Joel's insecurity cause issues and friction in his relationship with Clem.

\- Joel approaches Clem in the library trying to ask her out to go somewhere. Clem gives him her famous ""I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours"". In his mind, Joel confesses that even after that speech he still thought that Clem would save his life.

\- Then Joel breaks up with Naomi to be together with Clem.

\- We don't know if Joel had any other relationships before Naomi, but Naomi's phrase about Joel dragging his problems in every relationship assumes that if there were other relationships, Joel kind of was already in his own loop of constantly ruining relationships with his insecurities.

\- Joel and Clem get together, and as Naomi predicts, after the thrill wears off, Joel ruins it with his own jealousy and insecurities. It makes Clem go and erase him.

\- In an impulsive act, Joel goes to erase Clem too, but then he sabotages it, and he erases core child trauma memories that were causing his insecurities when he was with Clem.

\- After the erasure, by some miracle, Joel goes to Montauk and has his ""second"" first meeting with Clem there. But while Joel is depressed by having blank 2 years of his life (erased), you can notice that he's not that insecure anymore. After the conversation with Clem on the train, it's Joel who offers her a ride. It's wild to compare this Joel to the one who ran off from Clem in the beginning, you know? This New Joel even spends some time at Clem's home, and then when he comes home, he's waiting for a phone call from Clem with excitement.

\- Literally second meeting/date with Clem, they go to lie on the ice lake. While Joel is a bit unsure about this idea, he doesn't run off, and he goes along with it. He's *enthusiastic* about it. Again, compare it to the insecure Joel who literally left Clem alone in that house in Montauk.

\-After that in the morning Joel has enough self-security admitting ""I had the best fucking night of my entire fucking life"".

\-Joel loses it for a bit after the truth comes out, but to be honest, who wouldn't lose it like that in such a situation?

And the final scene in the apartment. New Joel listens to all those wild things his older version is saying, and he wants to fall through the ground out of shame. He's so uncomfortable while listening to it. When he says ""I wouldn't think that about you"", it's not just *words*. Now he's literally secure enough not to think such wild and evil things in his head.

It's the scene where you can see this huge gap, this huge difference between the Old Joel and the New Joel. The last words we hear from the tape while Clem is going out is ""I thought I knew her so well. But I don't know her at all. What a loss to spend that much time, only to find out that she's a stranger.""

It's the old Joel who spent so much time with her but didn't really know her in the end. And the new Joel isn't like that at all.

The final scene in the corridor mirrors the library scene they had before, and it's crucial to understand the difference here. Clem repeats her famous ""I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind"". And while Old Joel was still hoping that Clem would ""save"" him even after that speech, the New Joel was just literally exposed to the nastiest shit they had in their relationship. At this point, there's no illusion about ""saving"" anyone. New Joel says ""Okay"" as now he's secure enough to face all the imperfections he'll see down the road.

And getting back to Mary for a bit, think about the contrast. In the original script, she was still working in Laguna Inc many years later. In the movie, she's already been in the cycle of repeating her affair with Dr. Mierzwiak for an indefinite amount of time. But this final time, she learns the truth, and whether it's just an affair, or abortion in the more gritty version of the movie, she decides to break the cycle. She sends everyone's tapes back to them, and the damage it will cause to the company is hard to define. Whether it's just an affair or an abortion, at this point Mary doesn't want to have any business with Mierzwiak or the whole erasure procedure again. She burns the bridges.

And overall it raises an interesting conflict of ideas. While the original script is trying to prove that people don't change, and Clem and Joel would go into a repeating cycle, the movie tries to prove the opposite. The movie tries to prove that while people are messy and imperfect, there's still a chance for a brighter future as long as people are open enough to face the harsh truth.",87,0.84,9,2025-04-16 22:05:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1k0wubp/eternal_sunshine_of_the_spotless_mind_is_about/,PIRATEOFBADIM
movies,1k55hxq,Malcolm McDowell should’ve became an A lister,"Malcolm McDowell is a legend, but for some reason, he never became a household name. He really has had a long career and he was fantastic in A Clockwork Orange, If, Caligula etc. he was even really good as Dr. Loomis in the Rob Zombie Halloween movies even if the movies themselves weren’t the greatest. But he mostly does a lot of obscure and low budget films. He really could’ve been up there with the all timers, he should’ve had a much bigger career in my opinion",92,0.73,81,2025-04-22 12:50:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1k55hxq/malcolm_mcdowell_shouldve_became_an_a_lister/,These_Feed_2616
movies,1k4wtwl,Dave,"I just watched Dave tonight for about the 10th time. I love this movie! Not only is it a superbly acted comedy, but I think it also makes the very good point that anyone with a good heart could make a great president, which is what I think we need now more than ever! I also like how Dave was able to get all the right people on his side against the evil Secretary of Arms and ends up falling in love with the former First Lady. Hey, it could happen!",85,0.82,65,2025-04-22 03:35:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1k4wtwl/dave/,dcterr
