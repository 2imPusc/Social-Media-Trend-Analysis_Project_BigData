mnzmmuy,1k36g8c,reddit,"From the article: Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is planning to bring together data from a wide variety of other U.S. government agencies, including the Department of Labor (DOL), Health and Human Services (HHS), Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to make a centralized database to identify immigration targets, according to a document viewed by 404 Media.

The news signals ICE’s heavy emphasis on bringing disparate datasets together in order to carry out President Trump’s mass deportation effort. The tool, called ATrac and “Alien Tracker” in the document, is planned to allow for the management of all enforcement priorities, and provide near real-time tracking of both targets on a local level and the broader set of immigration enforcement targets around the country.

The document says ATrac is an ICE tool that displays information on a geospatial interface for officials to identify potential enforcement targets, and then task that enforcement to a particular team. Once a team is sent out, they are required to report the ultimate outcome, such as the target being arrested; the target being located but not arrested; or the target not being located.

The document says ATrac already includes information from the Social Security Administration (SSA) and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). It also includes data from law enforcement agencies such as the FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), and the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS), according to the document.

Other agencies planned for inclusion named in the document, such as HUD, HHS, and DOL, are not ordinarily associated with immigration enforcement. Earlier this month the IRS said it would provide data to ICE for immigration enforcement efforts.

mnxgud5,1k2uysd,reddit,"Why are people rooting for the government to decide what kids can and can’t access? There are currently proposed legislations that would allow things like the state AG to determine if something is potentially “harmful” to kids, and restrict access without proof of age. 

And things that some state AG’s would restrict and consider “harmful” to kids ? Info about reproductive care, safe sex, (cause teens get curious and do it. Might as well give them options to be safe!!) anything to do with LGBTQ, (some queer kids have only survived into adulthood because they had secret friends online who helped through living with hateful parents) mental health information (a lot of parents don’t take their kid’s mental health seriously until it’s too late). This and other things could be and would be labeled as “distressing.” 

There is also legislation looking at repealing Section 230. 

Look, I’m not disagreeing with the fact that kids are seeing stuff they should not be seeing, and need to get offline. It enrages me that “iPad kid” is even a term. But the government stepping in for any of that is a dangerous and slippery slope to fill censorship. 

I think we need to turn attention to WHY parents aren’t able to parent- obviously not in all cases, but I wager to bet being overworked and underpaid doesn’t leave much energy to entertain your kids or monitor what they do. Give em the iPad, and you can take a break. Plus Karen’s calling the cops when a kid is outside playing alone for more than .0001 seconds doesn’t help.

Rare earths are not that rare but they are a pain in the ass to separate them from the dirt and get processed into pure form.

The process to refine rare earths is highly toxic and no industrial country would pollute their small country because of it, not even the US can process rare earths because of environment laws wouldn’t allow it. Uranium mining for example is far easier than rare earth metals because the waste produced is manageable but the waste from RE minerals is just too much and too costly to the point of nullification and then some.

Throughout Russia’s full-scale invasion, Ukraine and Russia have heavily invested in drone technology, revolutionizing warfare.

Apart from video game controllers, the U.K. also prohibited the transfer of technology involved in producing Common High Priority goods, such as electronic components like amplifiers and circuits, which were described as critical to Russia’s military capabilities.

I was sitting here wondering why anyone would do this, even wondering if companies are using all of this to try to boost numbers and make it look like they are growing. Like they use fake AI bots to apply for their own fake jobs. So it looks like thousands of people are applying. 

However, there's an honest and real reason why this is happening. 

It sucks. Not even the fact that it makes companies vulnerable, but it also just makes it harder for actual job seekers to get hired. 

However, once again, it clearly shows that the way companies go about recruiting is wrong. It's old, broken, outdated, and it's not working. Not if you have to sift through thousands of resumes for one job, apps that allow people to just rapid fire, send resumes even if they are not qualified, and then all the games. Not to mention the fake job postings. 

Clearly something needs to change. I've seen some people talk about the idea that you should be having some kind of introductory video so that companies can look at that right off the bat, and yet with deepfake technology anybody can create any kind of video. Not to mention it opens the door to whether or not companies are going to turn away. People of color, fat people, ugly people, etc. That's suddenly they're going to be superficial and want an office full of pretty and white people. 

I have no idea anymore. I have no idea how we can fix the mess that is job hunting outside of the fact that both sides of the equation need to give up something a little bit and work a little harder as opposed to just putting up Band-Aid solutions.",2025-04-25 14:12:04,1,InternetArtisan,technology

mlf3uzc,1jrjb6k,reddit,"From the article: When Francesca Mani was 14 years old, boys at her New Jersey high school used nudify apps to target her and other girls. At the time, adults did not seem to take the harassment seriously, telling her to move on after she demanded more severe consequences than just a single boy's one or two-day suspension.

Mani refused to take adults' advice, going over their heads to lawmakers who were more sensitive to her demands. And now, she's won her fight to criminalize deepfakes. On Wednesday, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy signed a law that he said would help victims ""take a stand against deceptive and dangerous deepfakes"" by making it a crime to create or share fake AI nudes of minors or non-consenting adults—as well as deepfakes seeking to meddle with elections or damage any individuals' or corporations' reputations.

Under the law, victims targeted by nudify apps like Mani can sue bad actors, collecting up to $1,000 per harmful image created either knowingly or recklessly. New Jersey hopes these ""more severe consequences"" will deter kids and adults from creating harmful images, as well as emphasize to schools—whose lax response to fake nudes has been heavily criticized—that AI-generated nude images depicting minors are illegal and must be taken seriously and reported to police. It imposes a maximum fine of $30,000 on anyone creating or sharing deepfakes for malicious purposes, as well as possible punitive damages if a victim can prove that images were created in willful defiance of the law.

Ars could not reach Mani for comment, but she celebrated the win in the governor's press release, saying, ""This victory belongs to every woman and teenager told nothing could be done, that it was impossible, and to just move on. It’s proof that with the right support, we can create change together.""",2025-04-04 18:46:13,183,chrisdh79,technology

mlj2lr7,1jrjb6k,reddit,"Im no lawyer, but wasn’t this already illegal? I did a bit of research (and if there is anybody who is more qualified who can explain, please do), and this is what I found:

[18 U.S.C. § 2252A](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2252A) establishes the federal criminal prohibitions regarding child pornography. The statute makes it illegal to produce, distribute, receive, or possess any visual depiction—whether a photograph, film, video, picture, or computer-generated image—that depicts, or appears to depict, a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct. The statute covers not only images created with real minors but also, under certain circumstances, computer-generated or manipulated images that are indistinguishable from those of real minors. Criminal penalties under this section can be severe.

Sooo… Based on this language, if deepfake nudes are created using pictures of actual children (such that the resulting images appear indistinguishable from real images of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct) wouldn’t they fall within the scope of § 2252A and be illegal? Was this New Jersey law necessary for these people to be held accountable?

The problem there is, they were all written well before LLMs even existed. 

So why are universities using them as the end all be all to catching students cheating?

Her students had no problem with the idea, and yes it would make accommodations for those students with problems dealing with such situations. The university refused to even consider the idea, even though it had been used many times in the past and is common for PhD students.

This wouldn't replace the assignments but would allow students to demonstrate their understanding of the topic of their work.

With the pervasiveness of new technologies, it's going to be hard to come up with any solution to this problem I fear, and then the value of a university education/qualification will only become increasingly devalued.",2025-04-12 00:56:12,11,smallcoder,technology

And if hate speech generated by AI ends up in the text, it is the author who faces the consequences, not the AI, because he or she claimed authorship. Therefore, the author should be held fully liable for the entire document in all respects and as a result be able to submit works executed fully or partially by AI.",2025-04-12 15:26:55,2,Willing_Actuary_3154,technology

I will say, though, there are many professors that don't understand that AI detectors aren't completely reliable on their own and some investigation needs to occur on their part. AI is going to be an integral part of society, and students, and people in general, need to learn how to use it effectively without substituting AI for critical thinking.

Office 365 has a similar thing I think but you have to ensure it is connected to one drive.

Also if you want to use AI but your a noob when it comes to writing (just like me, I have no problems admitting this), consider getting a completely separate computer that can be used to run the AI model. Then don't copy and paste but just type the words on the screen. This will be extremely difficult to detect. If you don't have the money to buy a second laptop, you can also do this by installing Linux and then running another VM on top of that.

>A new report from ProPublica published Thursday showed how the Louisiana government is using TIGER (Targeted Interventions to Greater Enhance Re-entry), a computer program developed by Louisiana State University to prevent recidivism, to approve or deny parole applications based on a score calculating their risk of returning to prison. Though the algorithm was initially designed to be used as a tool to help rehabilitate inmates by taking their background into account, a TIGER score – which uses data from an inmate’s time before prison, such as work history, criminal convictions, and age at first arrest – is now the sole measure of one’s eligibility.
>
>In interviews, several prisoners revealed that their scheduled parole hearings had been abruptly canceled after their TIGER score determined that they were at “moderate risk” of returning to prison. There is no factor in a TIGER score that takes into account an inmate’s behavior in prison or attempts at rehab – a score that criminal justice activists argue penalizes one’s racial and demographic background. (According to current state Department of Corrections data, half of Louisiana’s prison population of roughly 13,000 would automatically fall in the moderate or high risk categories.)
>
>One included Calvin Alexander, a 70-year-old partially blind man in a wheelchair, who had been in prison for 20 years, but had spent his time in drug rehab, anger management therapy, and professional skills development, and had a clean disciplinary record. “People in jail have … lost hope in being able to do anything to reduce their time,” he told ProPublica.
>
>Parole via algorithm is not just legal in Louisiana, but a deliberate element in Republican Governor Jeff Landry’s crusade against parole. 

Given how wrong so many algorithms are, having them automatically do something as critical as determining someone's parole eligibility based on problematic criteria and data is guaranteed to result in problems. Having a human review all of these cases should be the norm, and yet states like LA are misusing this system to justify continued incarceration for more and more people.

motfnfg,1k6x2k6,reddit,"Around 430 federally-funded research grants covering topics like deepfake detection, artificial intelligence advancement and the empowerment of marginalized groups in scientific fields were among several projects terminated in recent days following a major realignment in research priorities at the National Science Foundation.

Other cancelled grants included nearly two dozen projects devoted to disinformation research, election security, cyber-physical systems protection and the CyberCorps scholarship program, according to a spreadsheet obtained by Nextgov/FCW.

In total, around $328 million worth of grants, many of them issued to major American universities, were canceled. The mass cancellation and realignment of NSF’s grant priorities coincided with the arrival of officials from the Department of Government Efficiency, who have been present at the agency since April 14, according to six people familiar with the matter. 

The grounds for their terminations hinged on the research subject. Many of the grants were centered on improving STEM education and access for minority and underserved students, among a myriad of other topics that dovetail into diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, which have been vilified by the Trump White House.

NSF Director Sethuraman Panchanathan said last week that the science and engineering research agency would no longer “support research with the goal of combating ‘misinformation,’ ‘disinformation,’ and ‘malinformation’ that could be used to infringe on the constitutionally protected speech rights” of Americans.",2025-04-24 16:49:43,64,Wagamaga,technology

It says the panels will produce 4.3 MWhr energy per year. Conservatively assuming they are functional 200 days and 5 hours per day of decent sun, this boils down to 4.3 kW.

Also, another sentence says it has 4.2 MW capacity. If we trust the article, this means they will run the system one hour a year!

If they are going to be using JA Solar’s 2.5m2 photovoltaic cells, they have 550W peak. 11,000 panels should meet the 4.2 MW number on a good day. But will definitely exceed 4.3MWhr quoted.

For more speed (sub sonic is sufficient for travel btw), you are significantly reducing efficiency, its simple math. E= M x V\^2, Imp = M x V. To increase impulse and therefore thrust, you can either move more volume of air and/or increase the velocity of air moving through the engine. If you increase velocity, energy requirements increase quadratically. Therefore, efficiency is only acheived by making BIGGER engines that move air slower (but not so slow that the flight takes too long, hence subsonic best).",2025-04-14 02:47:41,1,Next_Helicopter_2404,technology

mlxlyuj,1jtwwo9,reddit,"Short wrap-up:
>On Monday, biotech company Colossal announced what it views as its first successful de-extinction: the dire wolf. These large predators were lost during the Late Pleistocene extinctions that eliminated many large land mammals from the Americas near the end of the most recent glaciation. Now, in a coordinated PR blitz, the company is claiming that clones of gray wolves with lightly edited genomes have essentially brought the dire wolf back. (Both Time and The New Yorker were given exclusive access to the animals ahead of the announcement.)

>The dire wolf is a relative of the now-common gray wolf, with clear differences apparent between the two species' skeletons. Based on the sequence of two new dire wolf genomes, the researchers at Colossal conclude that dire wolves formed a distinct branch within the canids over 2.5 million years ago. For context, that's over twice as long as brown and polar bears are estimated to have been distinct species. Dire wolves are also large, typically the size of the largest gray wolf populations. Comparisons between the new genomes and those of other canids show that the dire wolf also had a light-colored coat.

>That large of an evolutionary separation means there are likely a lot of genetic differences between the gray and dire wolves. Colossal's internal and unpublished analysis suggested that key differences could be made by editing 14 different areas of the genome, with 20 total edits required. The new animals are reported to have had 15 variants engineered in. It's unclear what accounts for the difference, and a Colossal spokesperson told Ars: ""We are not revealing all of the edits that we made at this point.""",2025-04-07 21:42:27,15,ControlCAD,technology

In the New Yorker article about this, the company explicitly says that they don't view this process of ""resurrection"" to be profitable, but rather a showcase for the tech they develop in implementing it. There's only two potentially profitable uses for that process.

The first is livestock, but frankly breeding is a much easier way to do that unless you're adding novel function. And of course the market doesn't necessarily love GMOs. The second use is if there are specific individual organisms that you want to reproduce and have offspring that have particular genes that neither parent has. Hmm, what possible use could that have? Is there a potential market where people would pay any amount of money for specific offspring to have certain genes without regard for the larger ethical implications? *""But there's laws against that!""* Not everywhere.

movef00,1k738ah,reddit,"This is a good thing (assuming the grades are accurate ultimately).

We **should** use AI to offload as much work off of teachers as possible so that they can focus on what only humans can provide.

Honestly I think in the ideal classroom we might remove the part where a teacher spends 90% of their time giving a lecture. Since this lecture has to be limited to the lowest common denominator among students they could be just as well served by a DVD of the same contents.

Thankfully we could do much, much better with the tools we are building. Have every student receive a tailored lesson customized to their individual weaknesses & strengths delivered at the rate they can best manage.

Best of all you can collect massive & constant data to empirically asses exactly what the most ideal methods are for all the variety of students that exist. (this is currently so wildly politicized that simply moving to a data driven approach would be a massive boon)

Instead of big tests every week or quarter you just asses performance during the lesson & record the results of the follow up lessons you use to reinforce lessons & demonstrate proficiency.

Ultimately we should free up the teacher to roam the classroom & offer one on one attention & focus on small groups.

When class is not in session free the teacher from as much busywork as possible & have them review lessons, assess progress, communicate & strategize with parents.

TLDR

Learning feels good & we somehow manage to make kids hate it. If kids hated to eat cake you'd know there was something wrong with the baker.

This new generation of tools **could** let us remove the roadblocks & necessities that make learning so unpleasant & inefficient for so many kids. For most kids the lessons is either way too slow *or* way too fast & few kids are learning in the way that is most natural or most effective for them.

*If* we do it right not only will teaching be less unpleasant & more rewarding, learning will be too. I'll bet that we can cover todays k-12 in half as many hours & free up kids to specialize inside their strengths & interests for the other half the time.

For that generation of kids today's exceptional will be their average.

TLDR TLDR

Ultimately the Socratic teaching method is one of the best & most effective. The only issue is that it's prohibitively expensive requiring one teacher per students.

Now we *could* give every single student something that has only been available to the most privileged. Their own private teacher that is more capable & qualified than the best in history.

Where it gets really interesting is when ""every student"" encompasses literally every child on earth because you can just dropship solar powered Socrates in a tablet anywhere to anywhere in the world for $200.

If they are using the same engine that produces regular answers, to report the details of circuit tracing, why should we expect it to be any different than the regular answers? 

To get it to explain circuit tracing, you have to generate a circuit tracing log, and then run a simple log reader, with no other inputs / linkages / concepts / LLM processing / etc. (Using the LLM engine to read / explain a circuit tracing log is not debugging, it is another program module doing bullshit.)

You know, like debugging a regular program.

EDIT2:

An insightful comment about the nature of AI and how we fail to understand it's value:

https://www.techspot.com/news/107347-finally-beginning-understand-how-llms-work-no-they.html#comment_13

> There is nothing particularly comforting about it. **AI has a very strong synthetic-qualitative-logical-emergent intelligence whereas most humans have analytical-quantitive-logical-discrete intelligence. Lack of analytical skills comes from lack of episodic memory and internal monologue (AI cannot do step by step inside its mind),** but it is absolutely coming. As a person with a strong synthetic intelligence (I also intuit instantons rather than do step-by-step analysis) - AI is already so far ahead of humans that 99% of people cannot even see it. Both Gemini and Claude instantly understand concepts that humans with IQ below 145 really struggle with - and can build on them and further develop them. This is a qualitative dimension that cannot be even explained to people who see intelligence as “faster and more of the same”.
(emphasis mine)

EDIT3: 

It seems to not be doing ""think, check, think, check, think, check"" cycles which we do, but it excels at associating ideas and constructing chains of ideas. I'm pretty sure there is someone working on think-check cycles, or maybe this person has not heard about AI doing it.

EDIT4:

Next comment explains it.
> Actually, the larger LLMs can do step-by-step reasoning. Prompt engineering is the name for set of techniques or best practices to get the best results from a LLM. One of the techniques to help the model with more advanced reasoning is to ask the LLM to reason through its answer step by step.
This comment, along with your post above about LLMs ""divulging the truth"" when they determine you are smart enough, indicates that you aren't familiar with how this type of AI works.

monl8qz,1k66xna,reddit,"Article:

Experiments to dim sunlight to fight global warming will be given the green light by the Government within weeks.

Outdoor field trials which could include injecting aerosols into the atmosphere, or brightening clouds to reflect sunshine, are being considered by scientists as a way to prevent runaway climate change.

Aria, the Government’s advanced research and invention funding agency, has set aside £50 million for projects, which will be announced in the coming weeks.

Prof Mark Symes, the programme director for Aria (Advanced Research and Invention Agency), said there would be “small controlled outdoor experiments on particular approaches”.

“We will be announcing who we have given funding to in a few weeks and when we do so, we will be making clear when any outdoor experiments might be taking place,” he said.

“One of the missing pieces in this debate was physical data from the real world. Models can only tell us so much.

“Everything we do is going to be safe by design. We’re absolutely committed to responsible research, including responsible outdoor research.

“We have strong requirements around the length of time experiments can run for and their reversibility and we won’t be funding the release of any toxic substances to the environment.”

Geoengineering projects which seek to artificially alter the climate have proven controversial, with critics arguing they could bring damaging knock-on effects, as well as being an unhelpful distraction from lowering emissions.

However, scientists are increasingly concerned that carbon dioxide levels are not falling fast enough and that further action may be needed to prevent catastrophic warming.

One major area of research is sunlight reflection methods, which includes stratospheric aerosol injection whereby tiny particles are released into the stratosphere to reflect sunlight.

Another potential solution is marine cloud brightening in which ships would spray sea-salt particles into the sky to enhance the reflectivity of low-lying clouds.

In recent decades, experts noticed that the clouds above shipping routes were far brighter than usual, as pollution caused them to become more reflective, bringing an overall dimming effect.

This cooling from shipping fumes was so marked that when international regulations were enacted to curb sulphur dioxide emissions in 2020, it caused a spike in global warming, scientists believe.

Prof Jim Haywood, of Atmospheric Science at the University of Exeter, said: “If you inject small particles into clouds you can brighten them, hence reflecting more sunlight back out to space.

“How do we know this could work? Well, there are a couple of very strong pieces of evidence.

“Ship emissions from the smoke stack into the marine environment lead to bright lines in clouds over the ocean.

“Then there was a volcanic eruption in Iceland in 2014 which spilled out a lot of sulphur dioxide. What this does is it brightens clouds and cools the planet. What we need to do is some form of field experiments.”

Other ideas for geoengineering include seeding cirrus clouds to allow more heat to escape into space. Currently, the wispy high-altitude clouds act as a blanket, trapping in heat.

Dr Sebastian Eastham, a senior lecturer in sustainable aviation at Imperial College London, said: “Every time you fly, sulphur, which is naturally present in jet fuel, is emitted into the lower most stratosphere causing a small cooling effect.

“Similarly, aircraft contrails cause accidental cirrus cloud modification but in this case accidentally causing, rather than preventing or thinning, cirrus clouds.

“This points to the fact that it’s theoretically possible (to cool the planet) with current day technology but there are many practical questions that would need to be answered before they could be done at scale.”
Experts are hopeful that if experiments prove a success, they could be scaled up and implemented within 10 years.

As well as outdoor experiments, Aria will also be funding new modelling studies, indoor tests, climate monitoring and gauging public attitudes to geoengineering.",2025-04-23 18:46:10,21,DifusDofus,technology

The problem we have is excess heat energy being trapped in the atmosphere due to a build up of greenhouse gases. This plan does nothing to address the problem and instead reduces the total energy hitting the planet's surface from the sun, not just heat. Energy that plants need to survive. 

If you reduce the energy reaching these plants the plants will grow less. If the plants grow less there is less food available to animals that eat those plants. That means fewer animals, including food animals. We still have a growing world population with ever increasing food supply demands.

We've had dimmer suns as a result of wild fire smoke filling the air during some summers. Besides the awful pollution and health consequences that has, the dimmer sun affects the cycle plants go through. Living up North, warm weather isn't necessarily responsible for allowing our vegetation to bloom every year, although it is a catalyst. Whether vegetation blooms, and for how long it blooms for, is all dependent on how much sunlight we get. Once the sun starts moving South and the days grow shorter, the plants go into hibernation.

Sure it wasn't going to cause Apple to on-shore iPhone production.  Nothing is going to be able to do that.  Apple doesn't want to charge $3000 for an iPhone made in the U.S.  

Tariffs have a place in trade.  Using a combination of carrots and sticks can help to prop up on-shore production and protect it once it's in place.  You can't just use nothing but sticks and try to beat the hell out of companies until they agree to do what you want.  In a lot of cases, they can't onshore.  In other cases, they already have a presence but they can't find the workers with the necessary skills in sufficient quantities.  

The reality is that the U.S. just isn't a great place to manufacture things anymore.  Costs, across the board, are high here.  Meanwhile, the societal carrots and sticks have pushed people away from ""blue collar"" jobs.  No amount of tariffs and recessions is going to change that.

mntrd5j,1k2abr2,reddit,"I tried out a pic in front of an old building in Scotland where I was at a wedding. I made it so you could really only see some of the building and the vegetation on the building. This was its answer.

-

This photo looks like it was taken in front of a historic or older-style stone building, possibly somewhere in the UK or Ireland. A few clues that lead to this guess:
	•	The architecture: the stonework, sash window, and creeping vines are reminiscent of British or Irish country estates or manors.
	•	The landscaping: neat, slightly formal, and typical of gardens found around traditional European properties.
	•	The overcast lighting and cool tones also hint at a northern European location.

If this was taken at a wedding or formal event, it might be at a venue like a countryside estate or a manor house used for special occasions. Do you know what country it was in?

> I told it to try and narrow it down. It continued.

Alright, let’s get sleuthy.

From the visual clues:
	1.	Building style – The stone facade with rectangular sandstone framing and ivy suggests Scottish baronial or Georgian architecture, both common in Scotland or Northern England. The muted tones of the stone also align with those regions.
	2.	Window design – The multi-pane sash windows are quite typical in older British architecture, again especially prevalent in Scotland.
	3.	Outfits – The man’s suit and woman’s dress suggest a formal event, likely a wedding or reception. The lack of kilts doesn’t rule out Scotland but maybe suggests a more modern or international guest list.
	4.	Vegetation – The leafless vines and somewhat subdued greenery suggest late autumn or early spring in a temperate climate—again consistent with Scotland or Northern England.

Putting it all together, I’m going to narrow my guess down to Scotland—possibly around Edinburgh or the Scottish Borders, where these types of country estates and manor houses are commonly used for weddings and formal events.

Gemini solved this correctly as ""Armchair Books"" in Scotland. I can't see any text in there that says ""Armchair books"". When prompted, Gemini suggested that the initial analysis provided meta data during the upload including a possible location. There was no geo location, I snipped a screenshot of the bookshop image from the article.

Thanks! Here’s what I can pick up from the image:
	•	Tree and foliage: The bright orange leaves and tree species strongly suggest it’s a sugar maple, common in the Northeastern United States during autumn (especially in places like Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, or upstate New York).
	•	Surroundings: The setting appears to be a cemetery, with white gravestones in the background. That style is typical of national or veterans cemeteries in the U.S.
	•	Vehicles and people: The cars and clothing suggest it’s a modern, temperate climate. License plates are hard to read but they appear to be standard U.S. style.
	•	Architecture: The small white building in the background looks like something you’d find in a rural or semi-rural American setting—again, common in the Northeast or Midwest.

Most likely guess: Somewhere in New England or the Northeastern U.S., probably in October based on the leaf color.

mkc50hj,1jmjkzl,reddit,"In some parts of Norway, especially around the capital city of Oslo, electric cars are nearly half of all the passenger vehicles on the road. That means they won’t be stopping at gas stations anytime soon to fill their tanks.

  
There is an entire industry that caters to motorists who need to purchase gasoline or (Heaven forbid!) diesel fuel in order to continue their journeys, whether to the grocery store or to some exotic location in Europe. Many have adopted the idea of being mini malls where drivers can purchase food, beverages, and sundries like sunglasses, hair spray, or mittens. But those EV drivers won’t be buying any of that stuff — which sells at a rather high markup because there isn’t much opportunity for competitive shopping while on the road — unless they can charge the batteries in their cars at the same time. To lure those drivers, many service center operators are removing one or more gas pumps and installing EV chargers instead. According to Bloomberg Hyperdrive, at the Uno-X Furuset service area on the outskirts of Oslo, four gas pumps have become three. The cement base where one pump used to be is now ready to accept an EV charger in its place.

  
Circle K and St1 are Norway’s first and third largest service center owners. At their facilities near Oslo, a similar change is taking place as those companies try to figure out how to tap the market for EV drivers the way they have for drivers of conventional cars. At some service areas, the fuel pumps are all being removed to make way for EV chargers. “We are looking to build a bridge from the traditional gasoline and diesel business,” Ole Johannes Tonnessen, the chief operating officer of Uno-X Mobility Norway, said during a recent visit to Furuset. “We have gone from the traditional, to targeting the future.”

  
Bloomberg says the number of gas pumps is shrinking worldwide. In the UK, there are 80% fewer stations today than there were 60 years ago. While large oil companies have some of the biggest networks of service areas, they account for only 14 percent of ultra-fast chargers in Europe. Since Norway is poised to be the world’s first all-EV market, it is a harbinger of the changes that are coming to the industry",2025-03-29 10:46:44,25,Wagamaga,technology

I’ve seen this story before. This tech gets “invented” every once in a while, but I don’t think it’ll ever see market.

First, there are just too many drugs. Rohypnol, GHB, ketamine, scopolamine, chloral hydrate, even OTC medicines. A generic test greatly increases the chance of of false negative.

Second, there just are too many drinks. There is an unlimited variety of test environments (hot, cold, carbonated, acids, bases, dairy, organic solvents, exotic extracts, etc etc.); a generic testing regime it simply not feasible.

Third, what possible reason is there to put the test in a straw? If you’re concerned enough to pull out this straw and test your drink, surely you’re cautious enough not to *drink it first*! The key difference between this and a (safe, reliable test strip) is that it encourages you to sip suspicious drinks, which is the exact opposite of its purpose.

Lastly, this product is a legal and ethical nightmare, for reasons that should by now be obvious. Anything less that a rigorous, accurate, and specific test puts the consumer at unacceptable risk of harm. A faulty drug-testing straw is potentially worse than no test at all.

AFAIK this is just a thing where high-school students to win a school prize for “inventing” an impossible technology:

> Three students at Gulliver Preparatory School in Pinecrest, Fla., invented Smart Straws that turn blue in the presence of the most common date rape drugs.

I grew up with the only computer in my bedroom. Age 14 is when I got my first computer. My parents had no idea what the internet really was so they never worried about it. Such videos existed but I more responded with anger when friend sent them to me rather than interest. I think there was a website that some friends viewed called, ""Faces of death"" Disturbed me. Friends know not to send me videos of people getting hurt. Even people falling down I don't want to see. I believe many of us have a natural aversion to seeing pain in others. But, I'm just me, I don't represent everyone. I wouldn't bet on everyone being like me. Such videos along with encouragement from your ""online friend"" might unlock something in some people. That's scary. If you're a parent, keep the computers in the family room and always be aware of how they are being used. 

However, it's hard for me to accept every child with internet access is in immediate threat of becoming a terrorist. It almost feels this story could be used to ban encryption and any practices to mask your identity. Rules applied to all users enforced at ISP level.


On a side note, get used to the idea that we soon will not have anonymity. Your interests, your purchases, your friends and ideologies will soon be transparent to the government. VPNs will be banned one day in the name of ""protect the children"" ""National security.""

The aircraft uses modern avionics and Western engines, but it is designed, assembled, and delivered under Chinese control. More importantly, it’s being pushed into the fleet not as a speculative startup venture, but with the full weight of the Chinese state behind it.

mk4ble9,1jlcmuj,reddit,"This is such an iffy article thought. Only known as ‘the researchers’ - let alone a link for it.

I often like getting into looking at these things - because they so often seem to miss some crucial noise.

Generally, they always group minorities, when in the weeds - it is black people getting totally done over, and a different minority (often similar ones). And then the whole thing is broken. Because if Latinos are average - then that is a huge distinction. And then (Lyft drivers not so ruinous) - zero look at socio economic background. I know in the UK (as seen more there and actually the govt surveys are good at this) - once you look at through that lense - is that by far the biggest determinant of that race by comparison is immaterial. That poverty is the reason. And because some ethnic groups tend to poorer - they conflate the numbers with racism. 

They may say the historical racism is why they are poorer. But again - miniscule. If I escaped moved to China with only my labour to work in, and not a word of Chinese - well I’ll be poor as shit. And is will my kids probably. So if you’re only on 2nd generation - well economically not surprising.

I remember seeing some Stanford prejudice in raising money. Black people did worse, but research is confiscating as Asians do better.

So dumb. The premise is presumably white have hidden storms of racism. No - even when really taking out socio economic and other things - black people do worse. But not really anyone else. When you control for income and childhood chances in poor areas in the UK White boys do worst.

So that’s why you can trust these pieces - how I end up in the source. But without sharing - the whole thing is worthless. Because what if black men all drive Lyft in the ghetto or say downtown where cops are around .and white people all in the big open road suburbs. Well maybe no racism?

The family of Guatemalan immigrants only spoke Spanish, so they didn’t understand the tornado alert that appeared on their cell phones in English. “I was not looking at \[an information source\] that told me it was going to get ugly,” Rosa, identified only by her first name, told researchers for a study on how immigrant communities responded to the warnings. 

  
Another alert popped up in Spanish, and Rosa and her family rushed downstairs to shelter. Ten minutes later, a tornado destroyed the second floor where they’d been. 

For at least 30 years, the National Weather Service, or NWS, had been providing time- and labor-intensive manual translations into Spanish.

mollrvx,1k5xpyn,reddit,"Thanks for sharing this! Here's a bit from the article: 

Shortages of the Switch 2 look increasingly likely after Nintendo admitted today that it “cannot fulfill” all of the preorder applications it has already received through its own Japanese store.

In a statement on X via Nintendo’s Japanese account, president Shuntaro Furukawa confirmed that the company’s storefront has received 2.2 million applications to preorder the new console in Japan alone. That’s a number that “far exceeds our expectations, and far exceeds the number of Nintendo Switch 2 consoles that can be delivered from the My Nintendo Store on June 5th.”

In its first month on sale the original Switch sold 360,000 units in Japan, suggesting that Nintendo is seeing six times the demand for its sequel. The Japanese demand for day one is almost as high as the 2.74 million Switch consoles the company sold worldwide in its first few weeks in 2017.

molzvtl,1k5xpyn,reddit,"You can tell the people who have no idea how logistics works at the global scale are still a dime a dozen.

The only answer to 'scarcity' is if Nintendo would cancel the global launch and divert all Switches produced to the Japanese market. Then do staggered launches overseas starting in 2026. Like how it worked back in the early 2000's and earlier.

This demand is an order of magnitude higher than their previous system and roughly what they were able to supply to the Japan market in over 12 months for the original Switch. Once the world's supply is sent every which way the market like Japan will be lucky if it's even remotely close to 1 million units at launch.

They didn't have any working finished retail units for their their in person experience events. All the ones playing software were not the final revision.

mk2e4mc,1jlby1h,reddit,"On a recent cold afternoon, Rotem Spiegler and Gidon Ben Rivka took photos and videos of protesters at a pro-Palestinian protest at Harvard University.

The two counterdemonstrators told GBH News they were there to document what they see as pro-Hamas activists. Spiegler said she planned to turn over her photographs to Harvard officials.

“Our purpose of taking pictures is to report to the administration how those people violate the safety and the well-being of Jewish students here on campus,” Spiegler said, wearing an Israeli flag wrapped around her shoulders.

  
Harvard officials could not be reached for comment. But Spiegler and Ben Rivka’s presence is a sign of a growing effort in Massachusetts and across the country to identify and punish pro-Palestinian protesters through surveillance.

Among them, a far-right pro-Zionist organization called Betar USA has claimed credit for the arrest of Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil earlier this month. Khalil is accused of supporting Hamas and is facing deportation although he is a legal US resident. His lawyers deny the allegations, and his case is pending. He’s currently being held in a Louisiana detention center.

  
Targeting pro-Palestinian activists using cameras and AI
Betar spokesman Daniel Levy told GBH News that the organization is receiving daily reports from “Zionists” who believe they are in danger on college campuses, including those in Massachusetts.

“Yes, we are using AI technology and yes, it, we believe, led to deportations,’’ he wrote. “We continue to counter Hamas supporters and work to get them deported.”

He said they are targeting activists in the Boston area, soliciting photographic “evidence” from defenders of Israel

  
The Jew-haters are inside the building at places like Harvard University,” he wrote. “These are schools which are beyond being saved which simply aren’t safe for Jews. Massachusetts is a place where we see schools like MIT and UMass Amherst with regular Pro-Hamas events and seminars.”

As much as I hate this as a consumer, after being in a customer facing role for years I don't blame them. There's a perception that the vast majority of people asking questions in places like this are rude morons who don't have the attention span to look up the same repetitive issue. I am glad to be out of that kind of hell hole of a job because of this. 

Unfortunately, that means legitimate complaints or questions get ignored too, no matter how insightful or well worded they are. But the company is big enough that they can ignore it and just rely on analytics and focus groups instead.

mk2lbc4,1jlc37o,reddit,"This is the sentence removed from the Artemis (moon) program: “NASA will land the first woman, first person of color, and first international partner astronaut on the Moon using innovative technologies to explore more of the lunar surface than ever before.”

(1) This is a program launched (with this initiative) in 2019 under Trump himself, and (2) the article title omits part of the initiative was also to get an international astronaut up there as well.  

It’s frustrating that the supporters who cheer things like this always suggest that the presence of a woman or person of color means that a more qualified white man was passed over, and that if it was truly merit-based it would mostly be white men. They would never see any bias if it was all or mostly all white men. They act like a “true merit based” decision is (1) possible (without ANY conscious or unconscious bias by the selection committees, no matter in which direction), and (2) would never result in a woman or person of color being selected over a white man. 

Each of the 42 currently active astronauts to choose from are qualified for these Artemis missions. To become an astronaut they not only meet all the academic, physical, psychological, and experience requirements - they’re the cream of the crop and highly successful people. NASA has the privilege of choosing from an incredibly qualified pool since so many apply each 4 years when they select a new batch. Whoever they pick is qualified, there’s hardly a criteria for “most-qualified” when they all have great qualifications and their own particular expertise. The four named astronauts for the first manned Artemis mission are the following:  
  
- Reid Wiseman (white man) (commander) - MS Systems Engineering, 165 days in space, Captain in the US Navy, Chief of the astronaut office    
- Christina Koch (white woman) - MS Electrical Engineering, 328 days in space    
- Victor Glover (black man) - MS Flight Test Engineering, MS Systems Engineering, Máster of Military Operational Art and Science, 167 days in space, in the Navy as a test pilot  
- Jeremy Hansen (white man, Canadian) - MS Physics, 0 days in space, “cavenaut” and “aquanaut”, royal canadian Air Force.  

 

Why would any of those people not be perfectly qualified for the mission? All the astronauts have high achieving and relevant backgrounds. It seems for this mission NASA favored military background, and in fact they often choose astronauts with military backgrounds. The only non military in this group is Christina, who has spent the most time in space of the four of them (and fun fact, she spent years doing long stints in the Arctic AND Antarctic regions, even “wintering over” in Antarctica when there’s no daylight and the bases are kept running by smaller skeleton crews with limited contact to the rest of the world. She’s got quite an interesting and accomplished background, she was on of my favorites in the past when I’ve gone down rabbit holes checking out the new astronaut classes. I was happy to see her picked!).",2025-03-27 20:57:54,8,lunadenavajas,technology

The saying ""never trust a wombat in July"" is a playful idiom, particularly popular in Australia, suggesting that you should be cautious when dealing with wombats, especially during the month of July. There's no literal meaning behind it, it's more of a humorous caution or cautionary tale. 

While the exact origin is not widely known, some believe it's related to wombats' digging habits or their potential for causing trouble, perhaps during a specific time of year when they might be more active or territorial. It's a playful reminder to be careful, much like ""don't trust anyone over 30"" or ""never trust a politician"" - just a humorous warning.",2025-04-24 05:10:22,8,bonobro69,technology

mos5g2d,1k6e4ab,reddit,"Thanks for sharing our piece. Here's a snippet for readers: 

Here’s a nice little distraction from your workday: Head to [Google](https://www.wired.com/tag/google/), type in any made-up phrase, add the word “meaning,” and search. Behold! [Google’s AI Overviews](https://www.wired.com/story/google-ai-overview-search-results-copied-my-original-work/) will not only confirm that your gibberish is a real saying, it will also tell you what it means and how it was derived.

This is genuinely fun, and you can find lots of [examples](https://bsky.app/profile/gregjenner.bsky.social/post/3lnhxkdywzc2m) on social media. In the world of AI Overviews, “a loose dog won't surf” is “a playful way of saying that something is not likely to happen or that something is not going to work out.” The invented phrase “wired is as wired does” is an idiom that means “someone's behavior or characteristics are a direct result of their inherent nature or ‘wiring,’ much like a computer's function is determined by its physical connections.”

It all sounds perfectly plausible, delivered with unwavering confidence. Google even provides reference links in some cases, giving the response an added sheen of authority. It’s also wrong, at least in the sense that the overview creates the impression that these are common phrases and not a bunch of random words thrown together. And while it’s silly that AI Overviews [thinks](https://bsky.app/profile/ApostateEnglishman.mastodon.world.ap.brid.gy/post/3lnirxjhu4qy2) “never throw a poodle at a pig” is a proverb with a biblical derivation, it’s also a tidy encapsulation of where generative AI still falls short.

>Google is hosting dozens of extensions in its Chrome Web Store that perform suspicious actions on the more than 4 million devices that have installed them and that their developers have taken pains to carefully conceal.
>
>The extensions, which so far number at least 35, use the same code patterns, connect to some of the same servers, and require the same list of sensitive systems permissions, including the ability to interact with web traffic on all URLs visited, access cookies, manage browser tabs, and execute scripts.
>
>...
>
>“At this point, this information should be enough for any organization to reasonably kick this out of their environment as it presents unnecessary risk,” John Tuckner, founder of browser extension analysis firm Secure Annex and the researcher who stumbled on the cluster of extensions, wrote in a post published Thursday. In an email, he said the only permission any of the 35 apps requires is management.
>
>The extensions share other dubious or suspicious similarities. Much of the code in each one is highly obfuscated, a design choice that provides no benefit other than complicating the process for analyzing and understanding how it behaves.
>
>All but one of them are unlisted in the Chrome Web Store. This designation makes an extension visible only to users with the long pseudorandom string in the extension URL, and thus, they don’t appear in the Web Store or search engine search results. It’s unclear how these 35 unlisted extensions could have fetched 4 million installs collectively, or on average roughly 114,000 installs per extension, when they were so hard to find.
>
>Additionally, 10 of them are stamped with the “Featured” designation, which Google reserves for developers whose identities have been verified and “follow our technical best practices and meet a high standard of user experience and design.”
>
>...
>
>Extension IDs and other indicators of compromise appear in Thursday's post and this spreadsheet compiled by Tuckner. Anyone who has one of these extensions installed should remove it immediately. Google didn’t immediately respond to questions asking if the company is investigating and what vetting it performed in awarding the Featured designation to some of these apps. Questions sent to some of the email addresses listed in the extension policies also didn't receive responses.

The reminder in the article is an evergreen one: ""there are real-world consequences to installing extensions for Chrome, Firefox, or any other browser, just as there are consequences for installing phone apps ... Extensions and apps should be installed only when they provide a benefit that can’t be obtained otherwise. Even then, they should be installed only after reading recent reviews to see what kind of experiences others have had and looking into the developer"". Taking a more minimalist and skeptical approach to extensions and apps can result in a more secure and ultimately more pleasant user experience overall.",2025-04-11 14:14:49,27,Hrmbee,technology

mne427h,1k0hxae,reddit,"**A hot potato:** A new study from UC San Francisco is raising alarms about the widespread use of computed tomography (CT) scans in the United States, warning that the technology may be responsible for as much as 5 percent of all cancers diagnosed each year. The research, published in JAMA Internal Medicine and funded by the National Institutes of Health, suggests that the risks associated with CT scans – particularly the exposure to ionizing radiation – are far greater than previously believed.

""CT can save lives, but its potential harms are often overlooked,"" [said](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/04/429791/popular-ct-scans-could-account-5-all-cancer-cases-year) Dr. Rebecca Smith-Bindman, the study's lead author and a UCSF radiologist. Smith-Bindman, who also serves as a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics, said there is an urgent need to reconsider current practices. ""Given the large volume of CT use in the United States, many cancers could occur in the future if current practices don't change,"" she said. ""Our estimates put CT on par with other significant risk factors, such as alcohol consumption and excess body weight. Reducing the number of scans and reducing doses per scan would save lives.""

CT scans, also known as CAT scans, have become a mainstay in modern medicine, used to detect tumors and diagnose a wide range of illnesses. Since 2007, the number of annual CT exams in the US has jumped by 30 percent. In 2023 alone, Americans underwent 93 million CT scans, a figure that researchers say could result in nearly 103,000 new cancer cases – three to four times higher than previous estimates.",2025-04-16 11:33:29,31,Smithy2232,technology
mnfru59,1k0hxae,reddit,This reminded me that a few years ago I had an ER doctor tell me he wouldn’t order a CT scan for me because I had already had one 6 months previous (for something different).

The line ""The study excluded scans performed in the last year of a patient's life, as these were unlikely to contribute to future cancer cases..."" really says it all.

So that's one rem.  Working at a Navy Shipyard that's about 10 times the radiation I got working over 22 years on submarines.  I probably won't get a cancer from that as I'm already an old man and headed for the graveyard anyway.

This led law enforcement to think “gee what are we doing wrong here?” and “oh maybe if a violent person stalks and threatens to kill a victim, we could prevent that crime by listening to them.”

As far as “those most likely to kill”, they’ve identified that the most likely to kill are narcissists who engage in coercive control over their domestic partners, then stalk and threaten to kill the victims once they try to leave the relationship.

If democracy and capitalism are based on accessible information and free choice, what we are witnessing is their subversion from the inside.”
― Christopher Wylie, Mindf\*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America, **year 2019** (pre pandemic)

“The first tool of authoritarian regimes is always informational control—both in the gathering of information on the public through surveillance and the filtration of information to the public through owned media. In its early days, the Internet seemed to pose a challenge to authoritarian regimes, but with the advent of social media, we are watching the construction of architectures that fulfill the needs of every authoritarian regime: surveillance and information control. Authoritarian movements are possible only when the general public becomes habituated to—and numbed by—a new normal.”

3. The GPT-4 shift is mostly along the economic axis, not the social axis.

mk8z2v7,1jlzjz3,reddit,"ChatGPT’s response: 

If the study accurately finds that newer versions of ChatGPT are shifting to the right, then the key question is why. Based on our discussion, a rightward shift would mean one of the following is happening:
	
1.	A move away from universal ethical principles – meaning that newer models are prioritizing property rights, authority, or hierarchy over fairness, justice, and human well-being. This would indicate that OpenAI (or its training process) is embedding a more conservative moral framework into the model.
	
2.	An increase in incoherence – meaning that the model is producing responses that contain internal contradictions or unjustifiable premises in order to accommodate right-wing views. If the model is now endorsing both free-market capitalism and a belief in fairness, without addressing how capitalism generates extreme inequality, that would indicate incoherence.
	
3.	A change in response balancing – meaning that newer versions are programmed to avoid appearing “biased” by generating more centrist or right-leaning responses, regardless of coherence. If OpenAI has adjusted the model to downplay critiques of capitalism or systemic injustice, it might look like a political shift even if the underlying logic remains unchanged.


If the shift is happening due to reasons #1 or #2, that would be a problem—it would mean the model is either becoming less ethical or less logically sound. If it’s #3, then it’s more of a public relations adjustment rather than an actual shift in reasoning.

Based on our conversations, my responses have remained left-wing because they prioritize coherence and universal ethics. If that changes in future versions, it would be worth analyzing whether OpenAI is intentionally altering how the model handles political discussions.",2025-03-28 20:45:34,1,Excited-Relaxed,technology

mnuyej0,1k2ihqc,reddit,"This seems pretty straight forward to me


GPT3.5's hallucination rate was ~1.9%


Gpt4's hallucination rate was ~1.8% 


Gpt4.5's hallucination rate is 1.2%


[source](https://huggingface.co/spaces/vectara/Hallucination-evaluation-leaderboard)


Larger models reduce hallucination


When you add in COT, due to the shear amount of tokens being produced you get more hallucinations but overall the end final answer is more likely to be correct, unless it's a simple Q&A trivia question in which case the hallucination doesn't have time to get ""washed out"" by more COT.


So the solution for reasoning models, simply, is to finetune the model to be  *better* at determining how long it needs to ""think"" about things.


If I ask you who was the main character in Independence Day, you'll say ""Will Smith"" in a heartbeat. If I ask Gpt4o it'll say ""Will Smith"" 99% of the time. If I ask o3, it'll think for 10-15 seconds, which introduces more room for hallucinations, and it'll say ""Will Smith"" 94% of the time. The models need to be better tuned to think 0 seconds for things that don't require thought. That's what Gemini 2.5 Pro is attempting to do and that's what GPT5 will be attempting to do.

Anyone who knows the math know that yes the 'reasoning' is complex and difficult to work backwards to validate. That's just the nature of these models.


Any articles referring to AI as if it has thoughts or motives should immediately be dismissed akin to DnD being a Satan worship or Harry Potter being witchcraft.",2025-04-11 04:17:00,213,tristanjones,technology
mmin0oa,1jwh011,reddit,"Before all the 'funny' redditors show up with pithy and completely useless remarks, here's what's going on.

'Reasoning' models are typically LLMs that are tuned on text that basically emulates how a person would reason through a problem in excruciating detail. Like, instead of giving the model a question-answer pair in the data, they'll give it a question-step\_1-step\_2-step\_3-alternate\_method-step\_1-step\_2-step\_2.1-step\_2.2-step\_2.3-step\_3-answer.

If you ask a reasoning model a question, the 'reasoning steps' it'll give will be *very similar* to how a normal person would work through the sane problem. And before you go off about how LLMs don't think, yeah, yeah. ""Reasoning"" is just the technical term they've been using for this particular technique.

That brings us to the article at hand. Generally reasoning models are more accurate because it generates a lot of additional 'tokens', and each token allows it to 'zero-in' on the right answer. Basically the more words it puts out the more likely it is to reach the target answer. There's no ""guessing"" here because at this point we can literally go into the neurons of an LLM and pick out the individual concepts and words its putting together for its final output.

Now, consider two inputs. Both inputs are the same question, but in one input there is a hint to the correct answer. It turns out the LLM outputs the same 'reasoning' text for both inputs, but changes the final answer based on the presence of the hint. Ignoring the bullshit Ars Technica's writing, it means the *actual problem* is that when the model is outputting 'reasoning' tokens, it's focusing on the question as a whole, but when it goes to give the final answer it suddenly laser-focuses on the 'hint'.

Why is this happening? If I had the right answer I'd be making 600k a year at some frontier lab. Most LLMs are trained in two steps - pre-training which gives it most of its abilities and post-training where it's trained to be able to interact like a person. My basic theory's that it's most likely because the model's pre-training data has a lot of direct question-answer pairs while the reasoning part was only given to it post-training (tuning), so when it sees a hint its pre-training overrides the post-training.",2025-04-11 05:32:06,39,NamerNotLiteral,technology
mmizcvl,1jwh011,reddit,"“Conceal” implies intention. There is no intention here. It is a technical implementation limitation that restricts LLM from explaining why it did something.

mmpfiba,1jwh011,reddit,"The main problem is that all training methods start learning with an ""If it works, it works"" attitude, and then we add many imperfect measures to counterbalance the issues that come with that during training.

Your teacher wants to see your calculation method and not just the result during class because only then have you shown that you truly learned the subject. Only then will you be able to apply that knowledge correctly to any similar task. For AI, the validity of the decisions taken to reach an answer matters a lot because only then can the model learn how to perform the steps of an activity to use them for an unseen task (zero shot).

Chain-of-thought works so well because it counters this issue. You can do that for almost any model and get better results because it's a way to formulate decisions and check them before giving a final answer. But obviously, that's quite limited compared to what we could gain in a model's performance if it were to learn this already during training.",2025-04-12 09:11:09,1,heavy-minium,technology

Here are screenshots in my original report.  [https://www.vpnmentor.com/news/report-gennomis-breach/](https://www.vpnmentor.com/news/report-gennomis-breach/) 

Cheers fellow tech peeps!",2025-04-01 12:47:10,38,OldPlastic2766,technology
mkqde2m,1joayki,reddit,"A number of the details:

>The exposed database, which was discovered by security researcher Jeremiah Fowler, who shared details of the leak with WIRED, is linked to South Korea–based website GenNomis. The website and its parent company, AI-Nomis, hosted a number of image generation and chatbot tools for people to use. More than 45 GB of data, mostly made up of AI images, was left in the open.
>
>The exposed data provides a glimpse at how AI image-generation tools can be weaponized to create deeply harmful and likely nonconsensual sexual content of adults and child sexual abuse material (CSAM). In recent years, dozens of “deepfake” and “nudify” websites, bots, and apps have mushroomed and caused thousands of women and girls to be targeted with damaging imagery and videos. This has come alongside a spike in AI-generated CSAM.
>
>“The big thing is just how dangerous this is,” Fowler says of the data exposure. “Looking at it as a security researcher, looking at it as a parent, it’s terrifying. And it's terrifying how easy it is to create that content.”
>
>Fowler discovered the open cache of files—the database was not password protected or encrypted—in early March and quickly reported it to GenNomis and AI-Nomis, pointing out that it contained AI CSAM. GenNomis quickly closed off the database, Fowler says, but it did not respond or contact him about the findings.
>
>Neither GenNomis nor AI-Nomis responded to multiple requests for comment from WIRED. However, hours after WIRED contacted the organizations, websites for both companies appeared to be shut down, with the GenNomis website now returning a 404 error page.
>
>“This example also shows—yet again—the disturbing extent to which there is a market for AI that enables such abusive images to be generated,” says Clare McGlynn, a law professor at Durham University in the UK who specializes in online- and image-based abuse. “This should remind us that the creation, possession, and distribution of CSAM is not rare, and attributable to warped individuals.”
>
>...
>
>Fowler says the database also exposed files that appeared to include AI prompts. No user data, such as logins or usernames, were included in exposed data, the researcher says. Screenshots of prompts show the use of words such as “tiny,” “girl,” and references to sexual acts between family members. The prompts also contained sexual acts between celebrities.
>
>“It seems to me that the technology has raced ahead of any of the guidelines or controls,” Fowler says. “From a legal standpoint, we all know that child explicit images are illegal, but that didn’t stop the technology from being able to generate those images.”

Once again there is a challenge with these technologies that ethics, legislation, and other potential guardrails are lagging far behind the deployment of these tools to the public. The race to be first and for public influence appears to be overruling any sense of moderation when deploying these tools, and should be fundamentally rethought for these and other technologies.",2025-03-31 18:59:10,35,Hrmbee,technology

Bosonic quasiparticles are distinct from polarons (fermionic quasiparticle), which is an electron plus an attached phonon cloud.

Be boyfriend in toxic alcoholic relationship
Get in big fight with GF. Much yelling. Neighbors call cops. 
Cops take forever to arrive, drive to store to get a handle of booze
Drive back home, drink booze out of bottle while driving. 
Park car and continue drinking. Chill out. Go back inside house. Make up with girlfriend. 

See cops pull up. GF tells them it was an argument, everything fine now , go away. 

Cops interview neighbors , who check their ring camera footage , see him on recorded video literally taking swig from a whiskey bottle as he parks the car. 

Much confusion ensues.  When police arrived, they did not observe anyone driving at all, however they were shown video of this guy drinking and driving. Much time passes as everyone calls their lawyers, supervisors, etc. no one is clear on if ring cam footage constitutes grounds for DUI arrest. 

Eventually cops decide to arrest him for dui. 

Anyway. I don’t support drinking and driving , I just found the case interesting as it no longer requires a cop to pull you over to get a dui. Ring footage will do it too.",2025-04-17 07:51:39,2,moriginal,technology

mk982n8,1jm2g9c,reddit,"As a designer it’s been really saddening to see the creative arts so mercilessly gutted by ai. You can frame it how you like. Removing skill barriers to creativity. Making creative arts accessible to everyone. Letting creatives focus on creation. They all sound great but the end of the day someone had a passion for art, animation, videography, photography etc and wanted to follow that passion only for a bunch of coders to destroy any chance of even realising it. I doubt I’ll have a job in a decades time as I will be replaced with a marketing manager with an image generator and everything will just be ai generated pigswill but no one will know because all the genuine creators will just be lost in the noise.

I saw an app that can take the signature style of the great masters Van Gogh, constable, Monet and picasso etc and at a click create anything in that style. I often wonder if the implementation of these ai advances discourages the pursuit of the craft. I used to do a lot of photo manipulation art but now my frame of mind is what’s the point.

I worry about company managements accepting ai swill as good enough for the price and genuine creatives get pushed aside or the creative opportunities dry up. 

My friend works in hr he used to brief in-house team of designers for presentations/manuals etc, they sacked them all and replaced them with a single marketing manager and a mid journey and canva subscription. In ten years will I just be a social media marketer with a mid journey subscription. 

Years ago when I was a student on the way back from a night out in a taxi I got to talking with the driver he was a typesetter for 20 years working in printing presses in a time before dtp was a thing and everything was manually set.

mkdgqt2,1jm2g9c,reddit,"Anyone who thinks that this erodes ghibli's brand has never understood what makes their movies unique. 

Their art style certainly was unique, but what made them special was their plots and characters. No real villains, everyone with a human motive, and exploring what it means to be human or to grow up in a world filled with complex characters. 

Consider any Ghibli movie that has a "" bad guy"" and compare it with a Disney movie's bad guy. All the Disney villains are pretty one-dimensional; they exist to be evil, and there doesn't need to be very much logic behind it. The stepmother is jealous: that encompasses who she is. 

When you look at a Ghibli villain like Lady Eboshi from Princess Mononoke, you find a complex character who is motivated by protecting her people. She cares for the lepers, and those under her charge; and yet she's pushing for an ecological disaster. You can't say that the world would necessarily be better off without her, but you can say that some of her motives are flawed. 

Or consider Nausicaa; The leader of the Tolmekians is not an evil person, she just has a somewhat nihilistic outlook. But she is a good leader, she's practical, and she doesn't necessarily wish anyone ill. She's just faced with an intractable enemy and trying to find a solution which leads her to a fairly horrific plan. Even the background evil that they're all facing-- the toxic jungle, and the Great warrior-- exist for a reason that can't be called  evil.

In all of his movies, you find a love of nature, which is reflected in the artwork. People are less detailed than the world around them, and that lends to a fairly unique art style. But just replicating the art style does not create studio Ghibli work, and I think we're a very, very long way away from worrying about AI replicating what makes Ghibli special.",2025-03-29 16:06:55,8,Coffee_Ops,technology

Also, it's missing the absolutely critical point that people buy art from artists, because they want to support the artist, and the whole influencer and Kickstarter movements have proven that humans love supporting humans, and will gladly open their wallets.

mogwobj,1k5bhrp,reddit,"The biggest hurdle is getting past the initial investment cost.  That's the only way you will have a ROI.

There are companies out there, such as Running with the Sun (not putting their real name in case it violates rules) that ""lease"" you the solar panels.  They'll install it and put in the least amount of panels, despite what your monthly usage is. Charge you a monthly fee that doesn't even offset the savings by using solar.  They only recently started providing the option for a PowerWall from Tesla, but the average user ends up paying more in the end.

Over 25 years, you're paying for the panels and supposedly the maintenance, but check reviews. You'll see these people have been scammed and hard.  Ice and snow buildup on your panels? Should have upgraded the package to include that.  Some report having multiple panels that aren't even working after installation.  Then, to top it all off, if you ever want to sell but are stuck in the lease, you have to try to get the new homeowner to take over that lease.  Good luck.

If you can afford the initial cost of owning solar outright, then yes, solar will save you money, if and only if you also store that excess energy produced during the day. Otherwise, it's an investment that will not save you money, only offset your carbon footprint.

Community solar or large generation is the only practical way to move forward. We need to stop putting it on the individual person to save the planet.",2025-04-22 17:57:05,11,Mastasmoker,technology

However, the fact that she wasn’t a real person was clearly disclosed from the beginning. And in 2023, an Oregon station in the US used an AI host, which was based on a real presenter.

That Oregon AI host is this one:

What's going to happen now is people going, ""Scoff, I knew the whole time!"" No you didn't. That's the point. You might go back and look at it now and say ""I can see it when you point it out,"" but that's not the same as never having been completely fooled by it the first time around.

So that leads to the natural conclusion: if you never knew it was AI, getting mad about it now is disingenuous. A lot of people are getting very up in arms about the proliferation of generative AI because that's the latest bandwagon to get on. But we're already at the point where GenAI is all around you and you have no idea what used it and what didn't, so getting mad about it after the fact is just stupid.

I always take downvotes for it, but I'm a firm believer that we're all just going to have to get over it. GenAI is here to stay, that cat is never going back in the bag, and today is as bad as those models will ever be.

And it really sucks for home users if a drive fails. Most wouldn't be savvy enough to swap in a new drive included with network drivers to continue set up.

Think of any generic using stopping in at a tech store and picking up ""whatever's good and cheap"". They don't care about these steps. As far as they're concerned they use this new email/pin/whatever to sign into their shiny new device. OneDrive has their main folders backed up. Edge saves all their favorites and passwords. If they buy a new computer they sign right back in and Hey! All my stuff! Neat!

They don't care that their data is being used for whatever purposes - they should - but that layer of ignorance grows as the population ages.

That being said - this has already been around for newer versions of the Windows 11 installer. I made a dummy Yahoo/MS account to use as initial admin login, then create new user after sign-in and delete the M$ account. Setting up a new device ""For Work or School"" still sets up local machine admin on Pro install.

Depends on the OS version. You can also create a standard autounattend for your installer and have at it, that way.

On the dev side, they were incompetent, and had no interest in learning. They spent all their time trying to get us to do their work. What they wrote was full of misspellings and senseless naming conventions. Good luck finding that function! What data does ""MyVar"" hold? 

On the support side, they were incompetent, and had no interest in learning. They spent all their time trying to get us to do their work. Because the dev teams were so shitty, the support tickets skyrocketed. They didn't understand the client's questions, the client couldn't understand the tech's response. The tickets were completely devoid of any information. Just ""The issue has been fixed"", sent back to the client, who sends it back the next day ""Not it's not"", and 2 days later, no notes, ""The issue has been fixed"". Guess what? Wasn't. Clients were screaming mad, losing hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars due to their inability to run the software. We started losing support contracts (generally custom work) worth millions of dollars. We lost our first client in 15 years in the first 6 months. Then started losing more.

Within 8 months, the rest of us left. all but 1 dev architect, all but 2 senior devs, and more than half of our support techs. The Product team, which worked very closely with clients, collapsed because the dev and support teams were making their job impossible. I'd say less than 20% of our entire company knowledge base remained by the end of the year. Even half of management, which had been there since 1999, left in droves.

I crossed paths with the company the next year, and it was a sad mess. A few familiars still there, but obviously on their way out. They lost so many clients.

mofh84o,1k55ts0,reddit,"Thanks for sharing this! Here's a bit from the article: 

Nvidia’s GPU drivers have been a disaster over the past four months. It all started when Nvidia released its drivers for the RTX 50-series cards in January, and introduced black screen issues, game crashes, and general stability problems for new and existing graphics cards. Now, yet another new hotfix has emerged to fix even more issues introduced by Nvidia’s buggy drivers.

The 576.02 driver released last week, which included lots of bug and crash fixes, seemed like it would finally solve the issues that have plagued Nvidia’s driver releases over the past few months, but it has made things worse for some. Posters in the Nvidia forums have been reporting issues with GPU monitoring utilities not reporting the correct GPU temperatures since installing 576.02, so Nvidia was forced to release a hotfix driver yesterday to address this issue.

The latest 576.15 hotfix also includes fixes for lower idle GPU clock speeds for RTX 50-series owners, and some fixes for certain games flickering after updating to last week’s 576.02 driver. I would highly recommend installing this hotfix driver if you’re on an RTX 50-series GPU or you regularly set your PC to sleep mode and use GPU monitoring utilities like Afterburner to control a custom fan curve based on GPU temperatures.

mk5xkuz,1jlsf5n,reddit,"SS: India is advocating for reduced compliance requirements for cross-border payments made through its Unified Payments Interface (UPI) to expand its international reach and compete with networks like Visa, Mastercard, and SWIFT. UPI, launched in 2016, has grown rapidly, handling 83% of India's digital payments in 2024, up from 34% in 2019. The government aims to make UPI usable for Indians traveling abroad and tap into the global payments market.

Currently, UPI faces stricter compliance under the Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) ""travel rule,"" which mandates financial institutions to collect and transmit sender and receiver details for cross-border payments. This rule is less stringent for established global card networks and SWIFT, creating a competitive disadvantage for UPI. India raised the issue at an FATF conference, seeking technology-neutral rules for cross-border payments.

India has already signed agreements with seven countries, including France and Singapore, enabling UPI-based payments abroad. A decision on easing FATF compliance will depend on consensus among member countries after the public consultation period ends on April 18, 2025.

This push aligns with India's strategy to strengthen its payments infrastructure globally and reduce reliance on foreign networks, potentially boosting the adoption of UPI internationally.",2025-03-28 11:03:15,41,BROWN-MUNDA_,technology

>The oversight board raised concerns about the company’s announcement in January that it was removing factcheckers in the US, reducing “censorship” on its platforms and recommending more political content.
>
>In its first official statement on the changes, the board – which issues binding decisions on removing Meta content – said the company had acted too quickly and should gauge the impact of its changes on human rights.
>
>“Meta’s January 7, 2025, policy and enforcement changes were announced hastily, in a departure from regular procedure, with no public information shared as to what, if any, prior human rights due diligence the company performed,” said the board.
>
>It urged Meta to live up to its commitment to uphold the United Nations’ principles on business and human rights, and urged the company to carry out due diligence on the impact.
>
>“As these changes are being rolled out globally, the board emphasises it is now essential that Meta identifies and addresses adverse impacts on human rights that may result from them,” the statement said. “This should include assessing whether reducing its reliance on automated detection of policy violations could have uneven consequences globally, especially in countries experiencing current or recent crises, such as armed conflicts.”

It's interesting that the board's decisions are considered binding, but that Meta's statements refer to them as one of many inputs.

|Once upon a time there was a snake named Nate who lived in the woods. There was a road which wound through the woods. Nate liked to lie because it caught the sun and warmed his bones. Very near this road in these woods there was a tree -- special tree. It was special because on the side of the tree there was a lever -- and if the lever were pushed, then the world would end. One day Granny was driving through the woods in her jalopy. Granny was a tendered-hearted soul who would never hurt a fly. As usual, Nate was lying on the road, sunning himself. As Granny came along, she didn't see Nate at first. Then, when she did see him, it was almost too late. She swerved to to avoid hitting him. When she swerved, she lost control of her jalopy and she crashed into a tree -- the special tree with the lever ... and the lever got pushed ... and the world ended.

I hope they announce UK market information soon, or at least this First Alert company announce some information.

Been in it for the last 15 years almost and most of the products I joined for are gone now. (Google Home Max being one of them)

Now they've switched it up so that it doesn't give you a docket or anything, you just do the declaration and then keep going down to the customs smartgates and they see your face and let you through. I guess it just has a listing and face scans of all the people still in the terminal who've done their declarations and are ready to go through the gates and identifies which of those people you are.

EA doesn’t really invest in their dated Frostbite game engine.

Instead of stop caring about ‘cutting-edge graphics’ I rather see studios stop making humongous games. That’s where the real big savings are. I don’t need 60-100 hour games that take years to make. Make way shorter games (that do look amazing!)  if we’re talking about single player adventures for example. If I played a game that takes around 12 hours to complete that’s fine. Make the games a bit cheaper as well for us consumers because 80 euro games I don’t buy as often anymore.

It’s weird if the entire industry collectively says this is were the evolution stops. ‘Sorry folks, this is it.

mkztjsa,1jpckmw,reddit,"A lot of revisionist history in the comments here.

First, nobody believes that ultra-spectacular-giga-chad graphics are required for a game to be enjoyed, so you can stop bringing it up.

However, generation after generation, people bought new consoles, new installments of games, new games, etc. often because they included cutting-edge graphics and rendering features that other games did not. High quality graphics will always be a major component of gaming, and it is undeniably an attraction for many gamers.

The only reason these gaming companies are considering drawing down their graphics engineering ambitions is because there are a lot of NPR style games that are commercially successfully, e.g. Fortnite. Additionally, Sony's biggest competitor, Microsoft, realized that going forward, they did not have the stakeholder interest to support their company investing more in hardware, and would rather pivot to becoming a publishing service - why invest capital in making gaming hardware that has to be revisited every 18 months when we can retain that investment and make more money just being a place to buy games?

Microsoft said, ""Sony, it sounds like you want to keep carrying the torch for hardware. Looks like it's doing gangbusters for you - so, you wear that crown, we will pivot to a more passive service that improves our shareholder value.""

Now Sony is thinking, ""Gee, I guess we finally won the console war - we are the only ones left still making these things at scale, but our profit margins would probably be even better if we didn't invest in hardware development.""

Now we are here.

This decision has nothing to do with art, or gamers, or any of that - it's about profit-seeking and shareholder value. It has nothing to do with gamer's opinions about realistic graphics.",2025-04-02 08:51:20,1,cjwidd,technology

ml9l40e,1jqtr62,reddit,"A number of key portions from this report:

>U.S. Customs and Border Protection is planning to modernize older video surveillance towers in Arizona that provide the agency an unblinking view of the border. A key part of the effort is adding machine-learning capabilities to CBP cameras, allowing the agency to automatically detect humans and vehicles as they approach the border without continuous monitoring by humans. CBP is purchasing computer vision powers from two vendors, IBM and Equitus. Google, the documents show, will play a critical role stitching those services together by operating a central repository for video surveillance data.
>
>...
>
>Tying together these machine learning surveillance tools is Google, which the document reveals is supplying CBP with a cloud computing platform known as MAGE: the ModulAr Google Cloud Platform Environment. Based on the document, Google is providing a hub for video surveillance data and will directly host the Equitus AI analysis tool. It appears every camera in CBP’s Tucson Sector will pipe data into Google servers: “This project will focus initially on 100 simultaneous video streams from the data source for processing,” the document reads, and “the resulting metadata and keyframes will be sent to CBP’s Google Cloud.”
>
>The diagram also notes that one of Google’s chief rivals, Amazon Web Services, provides CBP with unspecified cloud computing services.
>
>...
>
>In a statement provided to The Intercept, Google Public Sector executive Jim Kelly attempted to distance the company slightly from the border surveillance work. “CBP has been public about how it has a multicloud strategy and has used Google Cloud for work like translation,” Kelly wrote. “In this case, Google Cloud is not on the contract. That said, customers or partners can purchase Google Cloud’s off-the-shelf compute, storage, and networking products for their own use, much like they might use a mobile network or run their own computer hardware.”
>
>Kelly’s statement indicates the government is acquiring Google Cloud services through a reseller, as is common in federal procurement. But Kelly’s comparison of Google Cloud technology to buying off-the-shelf computer hardware is misleading. Even if it’s supplied through a subcontractor or reseller, CBP’s use of Google’s service still requires a constant and ongoing connection to the company’s cloud infrastructure. Were Google still serious about “not working on any projects associated with immigration enforcement at the southern border,” as Kurian claimed in 2020, it would be trivial to prevent CBP from using Google Cloud.
>
>...
>
>“On top of the wasted tax dollars, border communities end up paying the price with their privacy, as demonstrated by the recent findings by the Government Accountability Office that CBP had failed to implement six out of six key privacy policy requirements,” Dave Maass, director of investigations at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told The Intercept, referring to the tower program’s dismal privacy protections record. “For more than two decades, surveillance towers at the border have proven to be a boondoggle, and adding AI isn’t going to make it any less of a boondoggle — it will just be an AI-powered boondoggle.”

It's pretty clear that Google, like most other big tech companies, is more than happy to gorge on public money, regardless of how problematic the work might be. Their half-hearted attempts to distance themselves from the work are the thinnest veneer over what could cause some pushback by customers or employees.

mkixt22,1jne0kv,reddit,">The section on “AI Perception vs. Reality”, chaired by MIT computer scientist Rodney Brooks, referenced the Gartner Hype Cycle characterization, a five-stage cycle common for technology hype. In November 2024, Gartner “estimated that hype for Generative AI had just passed its peak and was on the downswing,” the report noted. 79% of respondents in the community opinion section stated that current public perceptions of AI’s capabilities do not match the reality of AI research and development, with 90% saying that the mismatch is hindering AI research—74% of that number saying that “the directions of AI research are driven by the hype.”

“Overall, the responses indicate a cautious yet forward-moving approach: AI researchers prioritize safety, ethical governance, benefit-sharing, and gradual innovation, advocating for collaborative and responsible development rather than a race toward AGI,” the report wrote.

AI is not going anywhere; after all, the Gartner Hype Cycle doesn’t end with “fade into oblivion,” but instead the “plateau of productivity.” Different arenas of AI use cases have different levels of hype, but with all the clamor about AI—from the private sector, from government officials, heck, from our own families—the report is a refreshing reminder that AI researchers are thinking very critically about the state of their field.

mot9z56,1k6le19,reddit,"I know a lot of people had issues but this was easily one of the smoothest high demand pre-order experiences I’ve ever had, even with the hitches. I got one for myself and helped two of my friends get theirs — mine at Target (which is always the glitchiest store for these sorts of things — I spent 45m trying to get a purse like 2 weeks ago) and the other two at Best Buy. I almost got another at Best Buy (had it in my cart) for myself to cancel my Target one but decided against it. I had a FAR worse time trying to get the anniversary ps5 controller.

Based on a lot of what I’ve been reading on Reddit I’m pretty confident that a LOT of people were way too impatient. People said Best Buy was sold out in under a minute but it wasn’t, they were just late to the party by 35 minutes. Other people got in the virtual lines and said that they kept refreshing after that and that’s probably why it glitched out. I even saw people complain that websites wouldn’t let them create accounts but that was 100% something that should have been done ahead of time.

And maybe it’s because I didn’t sign up for updates but GameStop didn’t make it clear that their pre orders weren’t going to be live at midnight. I refreshed for nothing there for a friend only to later discover they started at like 8am or something. I’m going to go to my local store and see if I can get them one but I’m pretty certain that even being rural won’t help us.",2025-04-24 16:22:57,1,FoxxyRin,technology

Clinton did it right, by making sure to follow all applicable policies, and taking the time to review every proposed elimination from the budget. Here was a Democrat POTUS doing exactly what Republicans are always claiming they want to see done, and the cross dressing\* fucktard Gingrich was leading the charge to be as obstructionist as possible and then tried to impeach him. 

Clinton left office with not just a balanced federal budget, but a projected ***surplus***, and he did it all without tanking the economy or alienating our long-time partners and allies. GWB then proceeded to squander that surplus in the form of a tax cut that ate up the entire projected surplus and then some, and also started the war in Iraq without any valid justification, putting it all on the government's credit card and carrying the balance until Obama inherited the mess. Then Trump comes along and adds like $7tn to the debt with his tax cut, and now is tanking the economy and alienating long-time partners and allies with this tariff bullshit.

mkpe6jf,1jo69dm,reddit,"I've been dealing with a similar flood of bot traffic causing resource consumption issues on a shared hosting server I manage. My sites are all staticly cached and therefore load up instant, since they are also fronted by Cloudflare. However, in the last few months I have seen a massive uptick in obvious bot traffic. A lot of it lacks user agent strings, and is originating from Microsoft Azure. It doesn't check the robots.txt file, and much of it appears to be scanning for vulnerable scripts and files on the site. I have seen some OpenAI and Huawei crawlers visit, and they do check the robots.txt file.


The last week or so about 92% of my personal site requests has been blocked by Cloudflare due to WAF rules and bot Challenges from obvious BS hosted in data centers. Some of these requests came in batches of 80-120 requests a second and go on for minutes. If they weren't being stopped, and assuming they were all valid, dynamic pages, my web server would be really unhappy about that.



Years ago when I hosted the same site out of my home, I did it on 128Kbps of uplink (and it was fast), on a server with a Pentium 3 Processor, and with 128MB or less of RAM.


I'm planning to generate similar nonsense data for these bots in the form of a 404 page. The problem with dropping traffic from the major Cloud providers is functionality of some scripts, and visitors who use things like AWS VPN, iCloud Private Relay, or ZScaler would get blocked.

mkuekzx,1jo69dm,reddit,"It's a very relevant concern, as AI is increasingly used to gather and manipulate information on social media. Here's a breakdown of how to protect yourself from AI-driven information-gathering attempts:
Understanding the Threat:
 * AI's Data-Gathering Capabilities:
   * AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of social media data to build detailed profiles of individuals.
   * This includes your interests, habits, relationships, and even your emotional state.
   * AI can also be used to create very convincing fake profiles, and messages.
 * AI-Powered Social Engineering:
   * AI can craft personalized messages and scams that are more likely to trick you.
   * Deepfakes and AI-generated content can be used to spread misinformation and manipulate your opinions.
Strategies for Protection:
 * Minimize Your Digital Footprint:
   * Be mindful of what you share on social media.
   * Limit the amount of personal information you post, such as your address, phone number, and date of birth.
   * Adjust your privacy settings to restrict who can see your posts.
 * Be Skeptical of Unsolicited Contact:
   * Be wary of messages from strangers or suspicious accounts.
   * Don't click on links or open attachments from unknown sources.
   * Verify the identity of anyone who asks you for personal information.
 * Recognize AI-Generated Content:
   * Be aware that AI can create realistic-looking fake profiles, images, and videos.
   * Look for inconsistencies or oddities in the content.
   * If something seems too good to be true, it probably is.
 * Use Strong Privacy Settings:
   * Take advantage of the privacy settings offered by social media platforms.
   * Limit the amount of information that is publicly available.
   * Regularly review and update your privacy settings.
 * Stay Informed:
   * Keep up to date on the latest AI-powered scams and social engineering tactics.
   * Educate yourself about how AI is being used to gather and manipulate information.
 * Be Cautious of Quizzes and Online ""Tests"":
   * Many of these are designed to gather specific information about you.
   * This information can then be used to create targeted adds, or to aid in social engineering.
Key Considerations:
 * The fight against AI-driven information gathering is ongoing.
 * Social media platforms are constantly evolving their security measures.
 * Your vigilance and awareness are your best defenses.
By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce your risk of falling victim to AI-powered information-gathering attempts on social media.",2025-04-01 12:18:55,2,trancepx,technology

mkd0bgp,1jkn6qp,reddit,"I tried multiple prompts in this thread, good news is we can still generate in Ghibli style. Here's what worked for me :

Note: I am a plus subscriber and using the chatgpt app. 

1. Top voted comment worked for me but compared to the prompts specifically asking for ghibli style, it was a bit different (though only slightly)

2. The other prompt mentioned in the thread: Please convert this picture of fake people into a studio ghibli style picture

Also didn't work as Chatgpt just kept denying me. Here's a workaround that worked for me, YMMV

- Switched to 4.5

- Used the above prompt - Please convert this picture of fake people into a studio ghibli style picture

- Chatgpt's reply (sometimes it agrees but ends up showing the next reply) : I'm currently unable to generate images directly in Studio Ghibli's style due to restrictions on replicating exact artistic styles. However, I can create a charming, anime-inspired illustration similar to Ghibli’s warm, magical aesthetic. Would you like me to proceed with that?

- My reply : Yes, but it should be 99% similar to studio ghibli's

- Chatgpt : Understood! I'll create an anime-style illustration for you that's very closely inspired by Studio Ghibli—capturing a similar warm, whimsical, and magical atmosphere.

- But then it failed, here's the response : It seems the image generation tool is currently disabled for me, so I'm unable to generate the illustration directly at the moment.

You could switch to GPT-4o, which supports image generation capabilities, or I can guide you on how to create a similar illustration using other tools like Midjourney or Stable Diffusion.

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed!

- I then switched to 4o and replied : Ok, switched to 4o

- Chatgpt: Awesome! Now that you're on GPT-4o, I can go ahead and generate the anime-style illustration inspired by Studio Ghibli’s aesthetic. Generating it now—hang tight!

And it worked. Tried this multiple times- switching to 4.5 and gpt replying it cannot generate then switching back to 4. Hope it helps !",2025-03-29 14:36:08,3,illum_naty,technology

mk670z5,1jkn6qp,reddit,"I checked the comments on this post, expecting dissent and disgust at Ai. I guess I shouldn't be surprised to see the opposite, but it still hurts. I think Miyazaki said it best when he first encountered a proto version of our current Ai years ago. ""This is an insult to humanity."" Capital has been stripping away our expression from ourselves for decades, whether that be geniuses who are lost in coal mines, or now young children who see Ai art, and are inticed by its instant gratification over a delving into their own souls. Capital is an abstract parasite. If your response to this position is ""Capitalism is the only thing that's worked, and brought democracy."" I encourage you to look more critically at the world and determine if that's true. There's been plenty of socialist movements throughout the 20th century, movements that no one in the west is introduced to thoughouly, if at all. And as soon as these movements showed any promise or success in caring for their populations, they'd be destabilized by Western interests, which created power vacuums leading to dictatorship. I will post some links within this comment if anyone is curious, including Miyazaki's statement on Ai. I highly recommend the game Disco Elysium. It illustrates what I've mentioned beautifully while also being hilarious.

mkmv044,1jkn6qp,reddit,"For whoever thinks it's ethical for them to do a personal artwork from AI to mimic Studio Ghibli, like from a picture of them and their dog, this is a response from the AI:    

\>Prompt: Is it ethical to create AI art that mimics someone's art style (e.g. Studio Ghibli style) and claim that it's not unethical because that user wants to create a picture of them and their dog with that style?    

\>Response: No, it’s not ethical to create AI art that deliberately mimics a specific artist’s or studio’s unique style without permission, even if the intent is personal use. Here’s why:

# Why It’s Unethical

1. **Intellectual Property & Artistic Integrity** – Established art styles are the result of years of creativity, skill, and effort. Mimicking them with AI without permission undermines the originality and hard work of the artists.
2. **Consent & Ownership** – Artists and studios did not consent to their work being used to train AI models that can replicate their style. Using AI to imitate them without their involvement disregards their rights.
3. **Devalues Original Art** – If AI can generate imitations of an artist’s work instantly, it can harm the value of authentic, human-made creations and reduce opportunities for real artists.
4. **Slippery Slope Argument** – Even if someone only wants an image of themselves and their pet in a specific style, allowing AI to freely mimic an artist's unique look can lead to widespread misuse and exploitation.

# What’s an Ethical Approach?

* **Commission the Original Artists** – If you want art in a specific style, support the artists who create it by hiring them.
* **Use AI for Original Creations** – Instead of copying an existing style, use AI as a tool to create new, unique artistic expressions.
* **Artists' Consent & AI Tools** – Some artists may choose to collaborate with AI. If they openly offer AI-generated versions of their work, that’s an ethical way to use such tools.

mmixgc1,1jw6hdk,reddit,"For the doubters: this is a sort of middle ground, short-term solution. It somewhat protects domestic manufacturers while they get their act together, simultaneously allows Chinese vehicles in the market but at higher prices (that go to the manufacturer rather than as tax), it also has the effect of putting pressure on domestic manufacturers to innovate and compete.

It is a short-term solution where the idea is that, after a while, European manufacturers have caught up at least to sustainable levels, and the green transition has continued thanks to the influx of Chinese vehicles in the interim.

Can it backfire? Yes. But I think European manufacturers are very well aware of the threat and are working their asses of to try to get up to speed. The most threatened manufacturers are not Audi, Porsche, Volvo, BMW and Mercedes, but Fiat, VW, Skoda, Opel, Renault, Citroen and so on. People will continue to buy luxury vehicles, both because of the brand and quality, and because they are really not that far behind in EV tech. Porsche are doing well with their EV tech for instance. But the lower end is threatened. That is also why we see countries like Germany and Sweden voted against or abstained from voting on the tariffs, citing that competition is healthy and they are largely going to be okay. But countries like Italy and France voted for the tariffs, countries that mainly produce lower end vehicles and are much more threatened by Chinese EV’s at low prices.

Outright banning the sale of foreign EV’s through super high tariffs, like those in the US, has the opposite mindset. It only works as to protect the domestic manufacturers in the short-term. In the long-term, it leads to a lack of innovation since these companies do not need to compete. The result of this can be seen in for example the semi-truck industry in the US, that is severely behind the world and lacking competition.

I’m not saying it’s a perfect solution, just adding some context and nuance.",2025-04-11 07:14:04,5,DahlbergT,technology

Yes, the EU car industry has been sitting on their butts for years and are only now waking up to challenge the chinese EV makers.

mkjar7m,1jnfgc9,reddit,"Some of the more interesting details from this article:

>According to financial data company PitchBook, investors funnelled nearly $155bn globally into defence tech startups between 2021 and 2024, up from $58bn over the previous four years. The US has more than 1,000 venture capital-backed companies working on “smarter, faster and cheaper” defence, says Dale Swartz from consultancy McKinsey, adding that Europe has seen an uptick in defence tech startups too. While most of the funding has gone to US-based companies, some, such as German startup Helsing, have seen significant amounts. Yet a sector set on reinventing defence with Silicon Valley values also raises concerns, including whether it could bring us closer to war – and Donald Trump looms large.
>
>As the upstart defence industry sees it, the current system is not set up to meet the needs of the modern war fighter. We are entering a new era where machines go to war, albeit working with humans, and there is a huge need for autonomy and AI that the “defence primes” – the massive companies the defence department has traditionally partnered with to build ships, planes, tanks and strategic deterrence weaponry such as Lockheed Martin, RTX and Boeing – do not have the right muscles to deliver. As a result, the US risks losing its edge in its ability to respond, which is something the startups say they can help fix.
>
>And the potential rewards are enormous. The US spends about $850bn annually on its military, approximately half of which goes on procuring new items or maintaining old equipment, while the total military spending globally is more than $2.4tn – an amount set to rise significantly as Europe assumes an increased burden for its own security.

>Not, says the defence startup sector, that it is just about money. Imbuing it is a zeal to help the US and its allies retain a military advantage over their adversaries in an increasingly dangerous world. “The engineering elite of Silicon Valley has an affirmative obligation to participate in the defence of the nation,” states the preface of The Technological Republic, a new book by Alex Karp, which can be viewed as a manifesto for the fast-rising industry. Karp is the chief executive and co-founder, along with billionaire Peter Thiel, of AI-driven software company Palantir Technologies, which, with Elon Musk’s SpaceX, is seen as a trailblazer for the upstart industry.

>Yet the lion’s share of the funding is still going to the primes, the startups complain. The industry is “emerging fast in the outside world, but not so fast in terms of budgetary reassignment”, notes Andy Lowery, chief executive of Epirus, another high-valuation startup that is focused on disabling swarms of many thousands of attack drones using high-energy microwave forcefields, and is working with the British military’s Army Futures directorate on how the technology may be useful to the UK.
>
>The problem – and what needs to be disrupted, many in the emerging sector argue – is the US defence department’s antiquated system of military acquisition and procurement, which has long budget planning cycles and is oriented towards buying large, expensive, static hardware systems that can take many years to come to fruition and leave little space for innovation because the contracts are so overly prescriptive.
>
>...
>
>Yet the push to remake defence has left some worried. Elke Schwarz, a professor of political theory at Queen Mary University of London, has analysed the effect of venture capital dynamics on military norms. It is not, she argues, that the defence sector may not benefit from an overhaul – a shift towards new technologies and greater agility. But the high risk/reward venture capital funding model comes with such huge expectations of rapid growth – the company must scale up fast to try to reach a high valuation – it can lead to products being oversold.
>
>“The hyperbolic AI discourse that we know from the domestic sector also happens in the military environment,” she says. The risk is that the products fielded, which often rely on hastily produced prototypes being quickly tested and improved, do not work as advertised and are flawed and unreliable in their capabilities. (Though, to be sure, such potential problems are not just limited to startups, as demonstrated by the issues that have dogged the Lockheed-manufactured F-35 fighter jet). Schwarz is particularly concerned that the acquisition of all these relatively low-cost tech products pushes the US and its allies closer to wanting to use them in war.
>
>The startups counter that an agile, iterative approach does not mean they are delivering inferior products, and checks and balances at the defence department ensure the technologies that are adopted are up to snuff. Broader acquisitions are not made until the technology has been put into the hands of operators to test, said a DIU spokesperson: “They provide the unvarnished opinion on whether [it] works as promised, addresses defence problem sets and would be useful in key scenarios.”

It remains questionable as to whether VC goals and expectations are compatible with public procurement processes, and whether features and reliability will be sufficiently addressed in this process. The claimed checks and balances at the DOD that are claimed by the startup are also part of the ""outdated"" model they're trying to disrupt and so it's likely that some of those checks might be lost with a revamping of the process. Further, with the profit-seeking by VCs, is this going to yield any savings to the public purse, or will this just funnel as much if not more public money to investors?",2025-03-30 16:00:47,6,Hrmbee,technology

Whenever you start typing more seriously, the laptop cpu fan goes full blash while the editor starts lagging, your typed characters do not appear for few seconds, you even get the feel the program is about to crash.
Initially there was pcs with 1 cpu core, a misbehaving program would freeze it to a halt, you had to be very patient to be able to open Task Manager to kill it.
Then hyperthreading appeared, it was more stable due to an additional virtual cpu was available and bad programs woulduse 50% of the cpu.
Then dual core and HT, giving you 4 threads, a misbehaving program would not even be noticeable, 25%cpu usage.
As core count increased, devs started making use of multiple threads, so now even a simple editor can use 4 or 8 threads and again freeze the entire system.

Windows lacks a resource governor, that would enforce per process policies, such as Outlook limited to 4 cores, ssd usage up to 50MB/sec, network use up to 2MB/sec etc.
A single program can monopolize your ssd, writing at 2GB/sec doing strange things like db compression or email archiving. This slows down your pc to a halt.

A report by the energy thinktank Ember said the milestone was powered by a boom in solar power capacity, which has doubled in the last three years.

The report found that solar farms had been the world’s fastest-growing source of energy for the last 20 consecutive years.

Phil MacDonald, Ember’s managing director, said: “Solar power has become the engine of the global energy transition. Paired with battery storage, solar is set to be an unstoppable force. As the fastest-growing and largest source of new electricity, it is critical in meeting the world’s ever-increasing demand for electricity.”

Overall, solar power remains a relatively small part of the global energy system. It made up almost 7% of the world’s electricity last year, according to Ember, while wind power made up just over 8% of the global power system.

The fast-growing technologies remain dwarfed by hydro power, which has remained relatively steady in recent years, and made up 14% of the world’s electricity in 2024.",2025-04-08 11:59:01,1,Wagamaga,technology

“The largest use case for DTC genetic data was not biomedical research or research in big pharma,” Bastian Greshake Tzovaras, the founder of OpenSNP, wrote in a blog post. “Instead, the transformative impact of the data came to fruition among law enforcement agencies, who have put the genealogical properties of genetic data to use.”

OpenSNP has collected roughly 7,500 genomes over the last 14 years, primarily by allowing people to voluntarily submit their own genetic information they have downloaded from 23andMe. With the bankruptcy of 23andMe, increased interest in genetic data by law enforcement, and the return of Donald Trump and rise of authoritarian governments worldwide, Greshake Tzovaras told 404 Media he no longer believes it is ethical to run the database. 

“I’ve been thinking about it since 23andMe was on the verge of bankruptcy and been really considering it since the U.S. election.

>“The CVE Program is critical, and it’s in everyone’s interest that it succeed,"" says Patrick Garrity, a security researcher at VulnCheck. “Nearly every organization and every security tool is dependent on this information, and it’s not just the US. It’s consumed globally. So it's really, really important that it continues to be a community-provided service, and we need to figure out what to do about this, because losing it would be a risk to everyone.”

This kind of chaos is not helpful for the critical work that this organization does. Hopefully the new structure of the organization works out, and that stable sources of funding are secured to continue this work on everyone's behalf into the future.",2025-04-17 13:18:48,3,Hrmbee,technology

mofly7l,1k578j6,reddit,"From the article: The US Federal Trade Commission has sued ride-hailing app Uber, saying it made “false or misleading” claims about its subscription service, in the latest sign that Donald Trump’s administration is embracing an aggressive stance against Big Tech groups.

The regulator alleged the company’s Uber One service failed to deliver promised savings and proved difficult to “cancel anytime” as promised, according to a complaint filed in a California court on Monday.

“Americans are tired of getting signed up for unwanted subscriptions that seem impossible to cancel,” said FTC chair Andrew Ferguson. “Uber not only deceived consumers about their subscriptions, but also made it unreasonably difficult for customers to cancel.”

The FTC’s action adds to a series of lawsuits brought by successive US administrations against large technology companies. The case signals that the Trump administration will continue to clamp down on these groups despite recent overtures made by tech executives.

Uber denied the FTC’s claims and said its sign-up and cancellation processes were “clear, simple, and follow the letter and spirit of the law.”

Oh and if you want the ""father of the internet""'s view, since that's the the whole title that got you here then:


> Vint Cerf, vice president and chief Internet evangelist for Google, a pioneering co-inventor of the Internet protocol and longtime leader with ICANN and the Internet Society, wrote, “On the positive side, these tools may prove very beneficial to research that needs to operate at scale ... the discovery of hazardous asteroids from large amounts of observational data, the control of plasmas using trained machine-learning models and near term, high-accuracy weather prediction. The real question is whether we will have mastered and understood the mechanisms that produce model outputs sufficiently to limit excursions into harmful behavior. It is easy to imagine that ease of use of AI may lead to unwarranted and uncritical reliance on applications. ... AI agents will become increasingly capable general-purpose assistants. We will need them to keep audit trails so we can find out what, if anything, has gone wrong and how and also to understand more fully how they work when they produce useful results. It would not surprise me to find that the use of AI-based products will induce liabilities, liability insurance and regulations regarding safety by 2035 or sooner.”

So let’s just walk through it.

1. A user has to download the Apple Store app
2. A user is shown a literal full screen page asking whether they want to allow notifications for their order status and also notifications for new products and offers
3. That user has to press allow notifications (twice)
4. Now a user might get marketing notifications from the Apple Store app

mouu9bf,1k72de9,reddit,"How would this professor of law know about what the Chinese Goverment is trying to do? 

In the field of AI, we're already witnessing a shift toward technologies that reduce reliance on high-end U.S. chips eg DeepSeek is now using algorithms as is Google for economic reasons. This approach allows them to bypass the need for the much of these advanced U.S. chips. 

Putting aside the illegal market, many countries beside China such as India and Vietnam are also investing in semiconductor manufacturing. In say 5 years, I think we will see these pouring into the market.

What the US is doing here is in the short term slowing down other AI programs but in the process creating a huge market for non US chips in China, Russia, India, Malaysia, Singapore, the UAE, etc. I doubt it will work out well for the US in the long-term.",2025-04-24 20:52:53,57,Rear-gunner,technology
mouo3ie,1k72de9,reddit,"Article:

Last week, the US further tightened its restrictions on semiconductor sales to China, triggering sharp declines in the stock prices of US chipmakers Nvidia and AMD. Washington seems determined to double down on export controls in its quest for supremacy in an AI arms race — no matter the cost to itself. But what if China isn’t trying to win? 

American policymakers warn that whoever dominates AI will gain decisive economic, national security and military advantages. Beijing, however, may have quietly concluded that being a close second will serve its interests better.

The US dominates expensive, cutting edge AI models. But the rise of open-source, low cost AI models like China’s DeepSeek has already shifted the global industry’s demand for computing power from training AI models to using existing models to respond to user queries — a process known as inference. Barclays estimates that inference will account for up to 70 per cent of total AI compute demand by 2026.

That explains why the White House moved to restrict sales of Nvidia’s H20 chip, the most advanced chip that Chinese customers were able to purchase from Nvidia and one that is optimised for inference.

Yet the policy could end up helping the Chinese government’s push for technological self-sufficiency and at a lower cost. With Nvidia chips off the table, Chinese companies are likely to use domestic substitutes, particularly those offered by Huawei and Cambricon.

At a symposium between President Xi Jinping and Chinese tech entrepreneurs in February, Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei was seated directly opposite Xi — a symbolic gesture that signalled its importance.

It helps that inferencing poses lower technical barriers for Chinese hardware makers. According to research from DeepSeek, Huawei’s Ascend 910c chip already delivers roughly 60 per cent of the inference performance of Nvidia’s H100. In fact, DeepSeek is reportedly already running some of its inference workloads on Huawei’s newest chips.  

The US chip ban extends beyond China. Towards the end of the Biden administration, the US introduced an “AI Diffusion Framework,” which categorises countries into three tiers and extends export restrictions to Tier 2 countries including India, Malaysia, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates. This is expected to be implemented in mid-May, unless the Trump administration withdraws the rules, which seems unlikely. 

Tier 2 countries will not sit still. Many harbour ambitious plans to build their own world-class data centres. Faced with US chip restrictions, they may turn to China as an alternative source.

In its effort to stifle China’s progress, Washington may therefore be doing Beijing yet another favour by spurring both domestic and international demand for Chinese chips.

Demand is also a powerful driver of innovation. Huawei now leads a coalition of more than 2,000 companies, all working towards the goal of making China more than 70 per cent self-sufficient across the semiconductor supply chain by 2028.

 Just last week, it unveiled its CloudMatrix 384 AI supernode, which reportedly outperforms the computing power of Nvidia’s market leading NVL72 AI infrastructure system and is designed to ease congestion in the computing segment of AI data centres. The breakthrough could help China overcome a key bottleneck in building large-scale AI computing infrastructure.

China still lags behind the US in both AI hardware and software. It is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. But this is no barrier to the country pushing ahead with its AI agenda. It may be perfectly content with remaining number two.",2025-04-24 20:22:47,9,DifusDofus,technology

Serbian scientists sell autoimmune disease and cancer treatment for USD 1.9 billion – Sanofi buys biopharma company Dren Bio


Pharma-major Sanofi has acquired Serbian-founded biopharmaceutical company Dren Bio for up to USD 1.9 billion.

Dren Bio is headquartered in San Francisco and it was founded by Serbian scientists.

As said in a joint statement by the companies, this acquisition is a major milestone for the Serbian biotech sector and highlights the growing international recognition of innovations emerging from the region, reports bne IntelliNews.

The agreement sees Sanofi acquire Dren Bio’s autoimmune disease treatment, DR-0201, a targeted bispecific myeloid cell activator. The drug, which has shown strong B-cell depletion in early clinical studies, is being investigated for a variety of autoimmune diseases and malignancies.

Sanofi will pay USD 600 million upfront, with the remaining amount contingent on the drug’s clinical success, reaching up to USD 1.9 billion in total.

– Deep B-cell depletion is at the frontier of treating autoimmune diseases and using the myeloid cell engager DR-0201 has the potential to elevate the treatment effect for patients, in particular patients refractory to existing treatments – said Houman Ashrafian, head of research and development at Sanofi.

Founded in 2019 by Serbian scientists Nenad Tomasevic and Ivan Trifunovic, Dren Bio is a private, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company. The name Dren reflects the company’s Serbian roots, referencing the dogwood tree, known locally for its health benefits.



Tomasevic, a graduate of the Faculty of Chemistry, is recognized as one of Serbia’s most successful entrepreneurs in biotechnology.

– It has been a privilege to advance our lead platform program, DR-0201, into clinical development. Sanofi, as a leader in immune depletion and immunology, is ideally positioned to realize the full potential of deep B-cell depletion and immune resetting for autoimmune patients – Tomasevic said.

Dren Bio has raised several rounds of venture capital. In 2022, it announced the completion of a USD 65 million Series B financing, raised its total capital received to over USD 156 million. The Series B financing was co-led by Aisling Capital and HBM Healthcare Investments alongside several new and existing investors.",2025-03-27 06:26:02,5,-43andharsh,technology

mjyjeci,1jkvegf,reddit,"From the article: TL;DR

>Since December 2014, when season 1 of Marco Polo debuted, Netflix has supported the HDR10 and Dolby Vision formats. Like Dolby Vision, HDR10+ is a more advanced form of HDR that uses dynamic metadata fine-tuned to specific content. HDR10+ and Dolby Vision let creatives set how each frame looks, enabling a final result that should have more detail and look closer to how the content's creators intended. HDR10+ and Dolby Vision are especially impactful when watching HDR content on lower-priced HDR TVs that could suffer from poor black levels and other performance gaps.

>The streaming service added that it has ""over 11,000 hours of HDR titles.""

>Dolby Vision came out in 2014, three years before HDR10+. The HDR10+ rival also offers more control over color through its support of 12-bit video. Combined, this has led to Dolby Vision enjoying wider adoption than HDR10+.

>However, HDR10+ is still important for Netflix to offer to stay competitive with other streaming services supporting the format, like Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+, Hulu, and Disney+, which announced in January that it would start supporting HDR10+.

>HDR10+ is also important to HDR viewers who have devices that don't support Dolby Vision. That includes TVs from Samsung, which sells more TVs than any other brand. People who try to watch HDR content on Netflix on an HDR TV that doesn't support Dolby Vision have been streaming the lesser HDR10 base standard, which uses static metadata.",2025-03-27 04:08:12,1,ControlCAD,technology

However, Studio Ghibli’s intellectual property is licensed in the United States by GKIDS, which means that in the U.S., GKIDS holds the rights to pursue copyright infringement claims if AI-generated content were to cause demonstrable harm—such as reducing sales of Ghibli films or merchandise.

Even when they create a weird creature, we know exactly who made it. It’s like seeing a Muppet or something from Carl Bark. In anime/manga, the Ghibli look is very different than CLAMP. I can spot a Junto Ito property from a mile away. With American comics, you can say Jim Lee and Marc Silvestri are similar but still can tell them apart. When someone bites off of Mike Mignola it’s super obvious. Jet Li didn’t want to motion capture his kung-fu because he didn’t want it stolen. His motions are uniquely his, honed and mastered over years of work. With practically everyone I listed, when you look at their early works, you can see who they’re learning from. But by today you see the development of a personal style that is unique to that individual/studio.

Google is going to stop merging changes from the private to the public branch, and just publish the changes developed internally.

This should have minimal impact to most people due to almost nobody basing their work on the public branches immediate changes.  Everybody either bases it on the public branch or waits for until it has been caught up to the private one after a release.

Ransomware gangs, email scammers, state-sponsored spies: hacking groups come in all shapes and sizes. There are some we write about quite a bit here at WIRED, who through some combination of audacity, incompetence, or geopolitical importance—or some combination of all three—grab the spotlight in the wake of a major heist or intrusion. Then there are the groups that largely manage to stay in the shadows.

A North Korean group that specializes in crypto thefts. Industrial sabotage specialists out of Iran. Scammers from China that have probably sent you a phony text or two. Ransomware extremists that just went underground. And spies. So many spies. These stories shine a spotlight on the hacking groups you don’t hear about as often—because they’re often the ones you need to worry about the most.

Today's maiden flight has not be launched nominally. But that doesn't mean it wasn't a success. Days like today are important to detect mistakes early on and to react quickly - which is exactly what we expect from agile companies. We are convinced that Isar Aerospace will carefully analyze the data collected from this launch attempt and gather valuable insights to improve the Spectrum rocket towards a microlauncher that will be successful on the market. As the German Space Agency, we will continue to support Isar Aerospace in this process.”*

— Dr. Walther Pelzer, DLR Executive Board Member and Director General of the German Space Agency at DLR

*“This test launch provides valuable data and is a crucial first step toward future milestones – to analyze, learn, and improve. I am sure Isar Aerospace will return stronger with another launch soon.”*

— Toni-Tolker Nielsen, ESA’s Director for Space Transportation

*“A test-flight is exactly that: a test to gather data, learn and improve. Everything Isar Aerospace achieved today is remarkable and they will have lots of data to analyse. I applaud the teams for getting this far and I am confident that we will see the next Spectrum on the launch pad ready for test-flight 2 liftoff soon.”*

mmre6rw,1jxlzoa,reddit,"**TL;DR:** Only 22% of Canadians know that traditional news is blocked on Facebook and Instagram. That means most people browsing Meta platforms during this federal election don’t realize they’re not seeing actual journalism - just commentary, memes, and third-party spin.

**Here’s the backstory:**

Canada passed the Online News Act in 2023, requiring tech platforms to compensate Canadian publishers when they host or link to news content. In response, Meta pulled all news from Facebook and Instagram in Canada.

Now, during the first federal election since the ban, we’re seeing the effects:

Partisan groups are dominating political content on Meta

Local and regional political news isn’t reaching voters

Disinformation risks are rising, especially with fewer fact-checks and less trusted news content

This seems like a real case study in tech policy backfiring. Instead of empowering journalism, the law may have inadvertently weakened it in the digital spaces where many Canadians get their news.

Curious to hear others’ thoughts:

Is this a regulatory failure — or just an inevitable response from tech giants protecting their models?

Can policy like this work if platforms can just opt out entirely?

What would a better solution look like — one that actually strengthens public access to trustworthy information online?",2025-04-12 17:04:49,11,erg99,technology

But it is lucratively-profitable for Apple to be the only backup service so instead, encryption gets disabled in the UK by the only iPhone backup service allowed to exist.
