music,1ju79lu,"WTF?!?!?!! BoywithUke actively insulted San Francisco, the Warfield, and the fans who showed up to see him tonight - Musicians who do this should lose bookings","Last minute I decided to go to the Warfield tonight to see a show. I didn't know much about BoywithUke, but some of his songs sounded like a bop and I love the Warfield, so I thought ""Why not?""

Gosh, do I wish I had stayed home and not given a dime to this tour. Not only did he take the stage say he previously came to San Francisco to find himself but discovered that the city is disgusting and crime filled, he continued his rant about the location of the Warfield and how 60% of the crime is committed in the blocks around the Warfield. He literally asked the crowd, ""did you know that?""

This is on top of shushing a fan in the front row who was excited as he came on stage, he outright told a fan who said he was 10 who was near the front that when BoywithUke was 10 he was reserved and that the fan should be more like him.

At one point in the set he asked for gifts to be thrown on stage and then gleefully picking up a sweatshirt someone bought from merch and taking it backstage as he said ""that's an $80 mistake"" with a smile. He had the audacity to later announce that his favorite person on the tour is the person selling merch and sang some bullshit song that everyone should go buy his merch before walking off stage to a projection that literally said ""The End."" On top of all this, the majority of his set used prerecorded vocals so he basically lip synced the whole thing. This would be bad, but coupled with his total disrespect, it was the worst show I've ever seen in 15 years in SF.

I see nearly 200 shows a year across the country and have NEVER seen an artist happily insult the people and the place who are paying to put him on stage and give him a mic. It was an insulting waste of time and money.

Venues and labels need to pay attention to artists that do this by canceling contracts and not bringing them back. Being on stage is a privilege. Fans and cities are their lifeblood.

I, for one, will NEVER buy a ticket or a lineup which supports this completely ungrateful human and suggest more fans and would-be fans do the same.",4136,0.86,758,2025-04-08 06:43:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1ju79lu/wtf_boywithuke_actively_insulted_san_francisco/,PasstheGuacPleaae

music,1k2b0hz,Where’s all the protest music in the 2020s?,"In the 1960s, music was a major part of the cultural conversation. Anti-war and anti-Nixon songs topped the charts. In the 1980s, huge artists like Springsteen, Mellencamp, and Billy Joel were openly singing about the struggles of the working class and the effects of globalization.

Now, in the 2020s, we've lived through a global pandemic, mass protests for racial justice, extreme political polarization, economic shifts like tariffs and inflation, etc., but where’s the music reflecting all that?

It feels like there's way less mainstream music engaging with these themes, or at least it's not getting the same attention. Has protest music gone underground? Are artists more hesitant to speak out? Has music's role in culture shifted?

Curious what others think. Is it just me not aware of this music, or has something changed?",1109,0.85,971,2025-04-18 17:47:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1k2b0hz/wheres_all_the_protest_music_in_the_2020s/,Realtrain

Lead singer of my fav industrial band (KMFDM) was an absolute insufferable prick to bar staff and the folks in line. Dude seems so cool and his music is all about self ownership and being a decent person. But the guy got kicked out of his own show because the bartender didn't have a beer waiting for him (front of house bar, not backstage or VIP).

On the flipside, the dude from Nickelback is absolutely chill and has a great sense of humor. I was DJing a strip club and customers had asked to hear Slayer, but they hadn't tipped the dancers yet, so I made an announcement, ""If we see dollars on the stage, next song is Slayer, if not, it's gonna be Nickelback."" This dude at the bar turns around and gives me a huge thumbs up while laughing. I thought it was a Slayer fan. Turns out it was Chad from Nickelback and he tipped the bartender $300 for just one beer, signed a credit card slip with his name on it (not a stage name btw). Also smiled and waved on the way out.

I don't want to like anything about Nickelback but now I do.

John Mayer in the mainstream, particularly the past 20 years, is viewed as a pop sensation. I have never heard of such a technically gifted guitarist viewed in such a different light. 

He’s handsome. He’s pretentious. He complains a lot. But he is so frickin talented. On acoustic. On electric. In theory. In blues. Everything guitarists strive to be. Yet, some would slap you if you mentioned his name along others like Hendrix, SRV, Prince. 

I’ve listened to them all my entire life. I can play most of their songs. John Mayer is right up there. I feel like he will not get respected until he dies.

Some give him his credit. It’s just not popularly accepted at this point. His songs also served a different demographic for most of his career. But I don’t think that diminishes his technical ability. He also ventures into different genres. He did the guitar for most of Mac Miller’s later albums. He fills in for the Dead. That right there is crazy — to be so closely connected to two vastly different, yet adored, music scenes.

He also tries to teach the art of guitar, in his own pretentious way. He makes videos for beginners explaining his songs, how theory is involved in it, and how they can use that theory to create their own music. Not just replicate his.

This is a perfect pop song. Her vocals are immaculate. The musical production is baller. 

And it’s a song with not just a chorus, but a legit pre-chorus. All three parts of the song are distinctive and sound great. There’s a melancholy to the story. Chappell tells the story in an amazingly open and grounded way, embracing the complicated-ness of the themes. 

I think it’s the best pop song of the last decade. I think it’s a legit great, impressive, catchy-as-all-hell song.

music,1jq5iiw,Is the major label music industry just kind of a big scam?,"We often hear about artists signed to major labels going bankrupt or still being in massive debt despite years of success. Some examples are [Thirty Seconds to Mars](https://www.nme.com/news/music/jared-leto-recalls-how-thirty-seconds-to-mars-were-millions-of-dollars-in-debt-3785501), [Whitesnake](https://www.musicradar.com/artists/there-was-a-50-50-chance-that-id-be-able-to-sing-again-and-we-were-usd3m-in-debt-the-dramatic-story-of-an-80s-rock-blockbuster) and [TLC](https://beat.com.au/the-dark-tale-of-tlc-going-bankrupt-in-the-90s/). The reason for this is that, recording deals are essentially a loan. They fund and arrange everything you need as an artist, including the creation and marketing of your album, appearances, etc. In turn, they get a cut from your sales (music, merch, tour), though some have better deals than others. Most successful acts end up making the label back their investments and don't have to get a ""loan"" again. Others aren't so lucky.

1. While I understand the label getting a cut from the sales due to their investment, it is highly unfair that the whole transaction is structured as a loan. No other industry—whether that's television, film, video games or publishing—is doing this to their artists. Jennifer Aniston can have flop after flop after flop on her belt and she would still be alright. She's not going to get as big a cut from her ticket sales and she may not get as many roles as a result, but the film studio is not going to demand her the funds they used to make the film. They write it off as a loss and move on. Why are musicians expected to pay this back especially when...
2. ...they delivered their part of the deal: which is to make the album. The album exists. It's a real product. The record company sells it. They own the masters/rights to it and can do what they want with it. They can license it for use on TV, film, video games, and make money from it.
3. Labels often sign artists for multi-year or multi-album deals. Some even go as far as 7 albums. The artists can fulfill their full duties and be successful for years and years, but one massive flop, and it's enough for the label to simply drop the artist with no repercussions to them. They can just decide one day to not fulfill their part of the deal. Clive Davis (Sony) is notorious for randomly deciding he doesn't like an artist and deciding to not market their albums or limit their distribution, and then use ""lack of sales"" as justification to drop them, when it was his fault in the first place.
4. Oftentimes, artists signed to big labels have their publishing LLCs administered through the big three: Warner/Chappell, UMG Publishing/Universal Songs, or Sony/ATV. Which means the labels still get a cut from their songwriting and licensing of those songs regardless.

Why is it this way? Or am I getting this wrong?",386,0.9,79,2025-04-03 01:17:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1jq5iiw/is_the_major_label_music_industry_just_kind_of_a/,Kaiser_Allen

music,1jnwe9l,Amyl & The Sniffers,"Tonight I saw the best punk performance since RHCP @ TFC 1998. This band is electric, chaotic and fiercly indignant. Also, they can play. The tight and forgiving rhythm section doesn't falter to a singer whose prone to chaos and enthusiasm within her vocal and visual performance. She transcends the audiences energy while projecting back 10 fold. 

 When these folks get together they make great music with a middle finger to anyone who makes others feel small or marginalized. This is folk lyrics with angry vibes and it's better than Chicken after church. 

This is the most exciting take on music and frustration I personally have seen and heard since The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.

No idea what the future holds but if they keep doing what they did tonight....... so it goes. I for one will keep showing up.

Also, what did the American grunge bands think of them?

music,1jt87pt,"Are there any artists you would describe as ""one-album wonders""?","There are some artists that, despite a successful debut, were never able to replicate that level of impact with future releases. Take Alanis Morissette’s *Jagged Little Pill*, for example—an album that defined a generation with its raw emotion and catchy alt-rock style. Or Boz Scaggs with *Silk Degrees*, which produced iconic tracks like “Lowdown” and “Lido Shuffle” but struggled to maintain that level of success in later work. Even Third Eye Blind's *Third Eye Blind*, with its infectious mix of rock and alternative hits like “Semi-Charmed Life,” remains the band's most memorable record.

So, why do these artists stand out with just one major hit? Is it a matter of timing, where the world was ready for their sound at the time, or is it a reflection of creative limitations? How do you view artists like this in the broader music industry? Would you consider them ""one-album wonders"" or just artists with moments of brilliance?",364,0.9,504,2025-04-07 00:04:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1jt87pt/are_there_any_artists_you_would_describe_as/,Sea-Percentage9169

I’m trying  to build a list of songs that I generally like, but that there is one line in it that ruins it for me.  As an example, I like the song Two Heads, by Coleman Hell, but there is one line about “your daughter” that ruins the song. 

I’m curious if folks can think of a song that you generally like, but that one line ruins the whole song for you. And what is that line?",358,0.88,1285,2025-03-30 03:57:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1jn48zk/whats_a_good_song_that_is_ruined_by_one_line/,myhippocket
