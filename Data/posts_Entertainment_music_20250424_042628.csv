I know it sounds stupid because they are clearly different but I was combining parts from both songs in my brain lol. 

Anyway, I think the King Harvest version is better. Dave “Doc” Robinson had the perfect voice for that song. It has some soul in it. 

No offense to Toploader I think they did a good job just don’t like that weird 2000’s sound singers were doing like drawing out sounds thinking they were Christina Aguilera. The one part of this version I like though comes at about 1:52. This was what my brain was telling me was in the original.

music,1jpvjt3,Musicians Fight Back Against AI with Silent Album and Lawsuits,"The music world is rallying against the use of artificial intelligence in music production. In February 2025, over 1,000 artists, including Kate Bush, Damon Albarn, and Annie Lennox, united for a record protest. They recorded an instrumental album, ""Is This What We Want?,"" a sharp protest against suggested changes to UK copyright law that would allow AI firms greater latitude to use copyrighted music in their own work without consent from artists. Their contention is simple: if artists are being replaced by AI-generated music, music itself in the future may be vulnerable.



This is a figurative protest, but it represents mounting alarm among musicians, composers, and music industry experts about the integration of artificial intelligence into the creative process. They worry most that AI music, which can reproduce human songs by scanning massive collections of previous tunes, can devalue the creativity and artistry that give human music its uniqueness. With AI models now able to clone styles, voices, and even the passion of real-life artists, there are artists that fear having their work reproduced without the rightful recompense or credits. Meanwhile, big recording labels sue.



In June of 2024, Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group filed a case against AI music company Suno and Udio for employing copyright protected music to train their AI in the first instance. These lawsuits pose an even broader legal and ethical issue: should AI be taught using existing music without compensating original creators? Most in the business contend that without strong regulations, AI firms would be able to freely gain financially from artists' efforts while undermining the same business that motivated them. This fight extends beyond the music business—it raises basic questions regarding intellectual property, authorship of creation, and the role of AI in art. Some view AI as an unstoppable force that will define the future of music, creating new frontiers for composition and creativity. Others worry that if left to run amok, human artists will be unable to compete with AI-created material that can be created faster, cheaper, and on a jaw-dropping scale.



With artists, industry stakeholders, and lawmakers now disagreeing about the future of AI and music, the next several months could prove instrumental in shaping how copyright law adapts in the new world.



If AI music should be more tightly controlled, or is it just the next evolution of music? How do musicians get paid when AI are trained on their compositions? While protests continue to surface and lawsuits continue to unravel, one thing is clear—this battle is far from won. Where are we going? Should we throw open the doors to AI as a new creative force, or could it pose an actual threat to musicians and to the industry itself?

music,1jpuej8,Women and Children First is the best David Lee Roth era Van Halen album,"While most Van Halen can argue over what is the best David Lee Roth era Van Halen album, it's either Van Halen 1, Fair Warning or 1984, but I think it's 1980s Women and Children First.  It's the raw, unadulterated distillation of their unique energy, capturing the band at their most innovative and arguably, their most daring, showcasing a darker, grittier edge. This album took what made Van Halen 1 and 2 great and added Heavy Metal and Blues influences. This is also the album where Eddie truly began pushing the boundaries of his instrument, incorporating unconventional techniques and textures. Tracks like ""And The Cradle Will Rock..."", ""Everybody Wants Some!!"", ""Romeo Delight"", ""Loss Of Control"", ""Could This Be Magic?"" & ""In A Simple Rhyme"" ooze with a primal intensity, fueled by Roth's theatrical bravado and Eddie Van Halen's increasingly experimental guitar work. The album is less about polished pop and more about the band's ferocious stage presence, translated into a studio masterpiece. While other albums may have greater commercial appeal, Women and Children First captures the raw, unapologetic spirit that made Van Halen a force to be reckoned with, solidifying its place as the quintessential Roth-era release.",12,0.77,17,2025-04-02 17:28:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1jpuej8/women_and_children_first_is_the_best_david_lee/,NewPatron-St

It occurred to me just how rare this is. However I was listening to Black Holes and Revelations by Muse, and album I like a lot, and the first song, Take A Bow, doesn’t really do it for me. But most of the time, it’s very much the opposite, as an artist usually wants to grab you right from the go.
