1jna7fg,reddit,"Thinking of a game name, and I confused myself into thinking it was something else.","So, back in the 90s pretty much when ps1 was released I remember playing(trying to at least) a game that I thought was 'Time Commando' except... Its not that. 

The reason I'm trying to remember is because I could not get past the literally first few screens. 

Somethings I remember :

It was 3rd person. 
I only managed to see like 3 different screens, and it was like a mystery type game where I had to collect stuff. (I think) 
Bright colours, nothing dark. 
I remember there being a wooden boat, like canoe style. 
Male character.

The screens were like, male char walk in a direction, into a different screen. And I remember going back and forth between the same 3 screens for days. Then I gave up. 

I was probably like 6-7? So my memory is super hazy and all of it could be wrong; but I'm hoping someone may be able to shed some light. 

I even went through an entire list of games on the Web, but could not find it. I swear it was something like time commando, but it's not that game. I understand this is not a lot of info, but thought I'd give this sub a bash. 

P.s it may well have been the Sega megadrive, but I swear it was ps1

Edit: the male char was a white slim human male, and I remember him maybe wearing blue? That last bit could be wrong though.

2nd edit: it is eerily similar to Ark of Time. Almost to a tee, but I just don't remember it like that. I'm not sure if this is some weird childhood memory issue that I've got. But man the scenes I can remember just not the screens from Ark of Time.

☑️ Xbox Series X is my main console, for their 1st party games (Sea of Thieves, Grounded, Forza Horizon 5, Halo, Gears, Crackdown, etc), all the 3rd party games, and Game Pass, which is amazing. Also, 4K Blu-rays.      

☑️ PS5 for their 1st party games and playing old PS1, PS2, and PS3 games via PS+. I love playing games like 'Marvel's Spider-Man' and 'Syphon Filter' on it.      

☑️ Switch for Nintendo's exclusives, obviously.       

☑️ Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold for mobile games and Google Play Pass. Also, Xbox cloud and console streaming. I still can't believe this phone has 16GB of RAM. Blows my mind.              

☑️ Meta Quest 3 for VR, obviously. Also, Xbox Game Pass via Cloud Gaming. 

☑️ My Windows 11 gaming PC because it's kind of a monster and it pairs very nicely with Xbox PC Game Pass. Also, Steam. I hope those next-gen Xbox rumors are true.                

☑️ Google Stadia controller because RIP Stadia, but it's also *such* a nice controller to use on Android and Windows PC.

Does anyone actually enjoy this? I just find it a vague time waster and mildly condescending, as if the devs think that this is enough to fool me into thinking there's more content than there really is.

Devs, if you're reading this, you really don't have to make up two options if the difference won't change anything. It is a waste of both your time and ours!! In Stars and Time is a great example of a game where you only get one choice on what to say and--guess what? It's great.

1k3l0ac,reddit,"Seeking singleplayer RPG games with a lot of content to pass time, that are easy to hop-in and hop-out of","I am looking for some specific games for those moments, when you are ready to catch the bus, but it won't come for another two hours and you live 5 minutes from the bus-stop. Those games you play, when you're downloading the 155gb that is Stalker 2, for example. The games you dive into when you're waiting for that casserole to bake, and the stuff you play that you can just leave anytime and dive back-in. Does not absolutely have to be an RPG.

I'm not good at explaining without examples, so

Enter the Gungeon  
Stalker: Call of Pripyat with Misery mod  
Slay the Spire  
Risen  
Gothic 3  
Freelancer  
Noita  
modded Bethesda games  
Everspace  
Starsector

Basically something with a crapton of content OR replayability - ideally both, that has a good deal of complexity.

However I'd like to avoid games like Kenshi, Civilization, Stellaris etc. because they are too time-consuming with not enough dopamine hits such as finding a unique piece of gear, location or finishing a difficult quest.

Didn't really vibe with:

Darkest Dungeon (repetitive, boring combat)  
Binding of Isaac (combat also not as fun)  
Hades (not enough equipment variety, mostly about skills)  
any last-stand type of game  
Balatro  
Cult of the Lamb (setting)  
Don't Starve (It's time-consuming)  
Deep Rock Galactic (fun only with friends and I'm looking for singleplayer)  
Rimworld (time consuming)  
Stoneshard (boring, repetitive, not enough content)  
Quasimorph (same studio as above, same problems)  
Dwarf Fortress (time consuming)

3: Metroid Prime 1 on GameCube freaked me out the most especially when fighting the space pirates in the dark. As a kid I was too scared to play but eventually beat it when i was a teenager.

4: Earthbound also on the last level and final boss of the game. That last section is really strange and made me feel a little creeped out. I wont lie I was getting a little panicked during the ending of the boss fight, it was one big WTF moment because it was so unexpected.

1jnvnuc,reddit,"Atomfall: Shallow, tedious, and unrewarding.","Overall, I’m going to give the game a 5/10. It’s super addicting at first, and the exploration is novel, if not highly restrictive. The lack of a mini map wouldn’t be so bad if you didn’t have to press THREE buttons just to open the regular map. 

Combat is one of the worst parts of the game, as it gets very tedious very quickly. There is no progression in the game as weapon upgrade barely do anything noticeable, and you leave almost every fight with less than you had before you started. Stealth is available, but it’s janky AF, and you’ll get spotted if you come within 100 feet of an enemy. Lack of armor or other gear means you can never close the equipment gap, especially with the enemies in the third area, and the main story area. 

Oh, and enemies respawn anytime you leave one of the hub areas, and seemingly pop up out of nowhere. More often than not, I’ll scout an area, find 5-6 enemies, only to have 10 more pop up seemingly out of nowhere once the fighting starts. 

Weapon variety is disappointing to say the least, and as I said; upgrades never really feel like actual upgrades. Skill points have to be found because combat gives no exp, and none of them make you go “yeah, the game is better now that I have this!”

The story…exists. All of this to say that I’ve hit the 10 hour mark, feel like I’m about 60% done, and I don’t even want to finish. Only play this game if you want an extra chore that you’ll feel obligated to finish.

Who else remembers this classic from back in the day? Just putting it out there the community is still incredibly active, with people constantly creating new skins, mods, and maps. I’m not here to promote anything, just genuinely curious… how many of us actually played this back then? The multiplayer scene is still alive and kicking especially on weekends!



Anyone remember dm\_quarantine? That intense map where players would camp/hide in the basement during Survivor mode? lmao or the classic EVAC matches racing to the evacuation point before getting hunted down by a Xenomorph or Predator? Legendary that.

So who else was into this absolute gem back in the day? Or better yet… who’s still playing?

 It’s still one of a kind truly timeless. If you’ve ever thought about jumping back in, I highly recommend checking out the three main subreddits (which I help moderate)

Edit 2: There are some really good suggestions, but we probably wont be playing games like Helldivers 2 because it would require each having their own system, but they have an Xbox and PS5 and Xbox doesnt have Helldivers 2. So only 2 can play that game. This would have been a good rec otherwise and we would have played in an easier difficulty.

1k44q8v,reddit,Game Recommendations For a 60+ Retiree,"Hello everyone, as you could probably guess from the title, I am in search of video game recommendations for my 60+ year old retired mother.

Now for some background information, I got my mother into gaming at a stressful point in her work career which was also near the end of her professional life. At this point, these games were fairly simple, cozy, and relaxing. They were an escape from the stress. This mostly was taken up by Animal Crossing New Horizons. 

Now that my mother has retired, the stress of a full time job is gone and her time is free. She’s really adapted well to this change, and has also picked up gaming at an alarming pace. By this I mean, she has sunk 300+ hours between TOTK and BOTW, as well as a good chunk of time in Echoes of Wisdom. Evidently a Zelda fan. Outside of Zelda she has also enjoyed and completed Hogwarts Legacy and Witcher 3 to which she said “it felt too short”.  She’s currently replaying Witcher. 

Currently she only has a switch, but I am helping her look into getting a PC since she really has been enjoying gaming especially in her retirement.

From what she has told me, The Witcher 3 is her favourite game so far with the Zelda series being close behind. In terms of preference from a broader sense, she enjoys games that provide an adventure, a good story, and a somewhat cinematic experience. Difficulty wise, she’s been ramping up, she enjoyed the combat to The Witcher, but she can get overwhelmed and stressed out when games have too many different button inputs, or overwhelming combat. 

Please let me know some good game recommendations that she could play on switch.",2025-04-21 04:07:29,gaming,gaming,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,21,109,,0.62,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1k44q8v/game_recommendations_for_a_60_retiree/,TheSpecialApple

My son would like to have all his buddies over for a gaming themed & focused ""LAN Party"". Has anyone else done on for their kid(s)? How did you go about it, and what types of ideas did you have? Were there any unexpected challenges?  
  
All his 6 friends he's inviting has a console at home, and we only have the one Xbox but have access to multiple TVs - so my thoughts are to inquire if the parents would be willing to let their kids bring their console/controller? 

Other cool Idea's I've though up are having ChatGPT create 'e-sports style logos' of their gamer names and printing stuff (ie: cups, maybe shirts) with their logo on it at their stations. 

Fortnite is the game they'll likely be playing. 

I do have 2g WIFI and ethernet cables to take the load off WIFI. 

Other than that, just ordering a bunch of gamer-themed decorations and making sure they're all in the same room close to the router. 

Any other ideas, or helpful tips would be appreciated! :)

1k4or57,reddit,Sonic as a Metroidvania - The Perfect Game formula for a New Direction in the Series?,"Hear me out;

A re-imagining of a 2D Sonic game. think of a world in the vein of games like Ori and the Blind forest, Hollow Knight et al. Incredible 2D visuals with the upgrade gameplay formula of Super Metroid, You play as Sonic, you're dropped into a mysterious new island, you have a huge 2D open world to explore, you need to gather the chaos emeralds which have been scattered all over, with each granting you a new ability, the game has different biomes instead of traditional linear  levels or 'Zones' and 'Acts' with A to B gameplay. The standard metroidvania gameplay loop is intact allowing certain areas and biomes to be accessed when new abilities are discovered.

The reason why I think this is perfect:

* The giant open world is perfect for the gimmick - speed and traversal + exploration, something the classic stage/zone formula fails to balance correctly due to the constrained limitations of each linear level, affecting the 'flow' of the game, instead of A - B gameplay, you must backtrack and explore and familiarize yourself with the world - the game world can be perfectly designed for his abilities without the usual annoying hurdles found in linear levels, areas can be seamless instead. The map can be designed with much more care and attention.

* Chaos emeralds are literally the perfect item for collecting in key areas to regain an ability - unlock spin dash - unlock speed rush - unlock homing attack, super sonic? - etc. etc., A boss can be fought at each emerald location.

* Rings can be collected as healing, dispersed when defeating basic enemies in the overworld, they actually serve some purpose other than a glorified 1-hit shield.

* One of the main problems people have with the older games in a 2D space is a conflict of objectives, they think you're supposed to race to the end as quick as possible since it's all about speed, just to run into egregiously placed enemy and/or spikes and stuff causing for irritating and unclear objectives, there is no need for that in an open end-to-end world design, speed can co-exist with exploration much more naturally.

* With the idea of upgrade abilities allowing increased speed and finesse of movement, past areas can be blasted through with ease and lower level enemies dispatched as you become stronger, again lending a better gameplay feel; the sense of speed and abilities of his character, something which again is constrained as an idea in the older level-based approach with poor balance.

The whole identity of a 2D sonic game is intact, loop-de-loops and all, it just opens up a whole new design potential and allows better curation for that style of game in the 2D formula, being able to interact with the world and change the world through your actions is huge.

It can't just be me who feels this, the Metroidvania genre is practically crying out for a Sonic game! It almost feels made for it.",2025-04-21 21:09:57,gaming,gaming,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,25,42,,0.61,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1k4or57/sonic_as_a_metroidvania_the_perfect_game_formula/,InfiniteAir

1jxulqc,reddit,Is there a genre for games like this?,"So I recently played a few games that I have ABSOLUTELY fallen in love with, and I wanted to see if this is actually part of a broader genre or not.  The two games are Wayfinder and Dungeons of Sundaria.  Basically, these games are multiplayer dungeon crawlers where you complete short, 5-30min PvE dungeons that have traditional MMO-style mechanics (lots of boss mechanics, a focus on optimizing skill rotations, active dodging, etc.).  Unfortunately ,development for both games has unofficially stopped.  Wayfinder suffered from some launch issues that gave it a rough start, and Dungeons of Sundaria is run by a indie team that may or may not have had the resources to support it long-term.

Is there a name for this genre?  Are there other games that offer similar styles of gameplay?

  
I have tried a few games that are in similar niches such as Deep Rock Galactic and Vermintide.  However, these are all far more FPS-heavy, don't really have anything to speak of for boss mechanics, and have essentially no traditional RPG-style skills or gear progression.  Rabbit and Steel is the closest alternate game I've found, but it is a roguelike with minimal meta progression or gearing.  The key mechanics that set the games I'm interested in apart are:

* Multiplayer w/ PvE focus
* RPG-style gear/character build progression
* MMO-style skills and multiple class roles

1k602ee,reddit,Does anyone else find the idea of sandbox games more exciting than actually playing them?,"I found myself wanting to play some kind of sandbox game that involved building or managing a kingdom in some way, and after a lot of googling and faffing around I came across a game called Saelig. Which is essentially medieval Kenshi. A sandbox, medieval life simulator in essence where you start your life as whatever you want to be and do whatever the hell you want.

But what I've found is that I apparently lack imagination. I boot it up with grand intentions of giving my character this backstory and personality traits with certain ambitions. But then I end up just sort of... doing nothing. 

I dunno what it is. Maybe it's a matter of immersion that gets easily shattered by clunky controls and mechanics usually present in these games. Or perhaps it's a time thing. As a working adult I don't have the time to fully indulge myself in these games. Even when I have the time you never know when something will come up that needs to be done.

I also think perhaps that I expect too much from these games. I think I want the world to feel more alive and react to my character and itself more than current games allows so that they can't be ""gamed"" in a sense, because after a while you figure the mechanics out and there's no real surprise or intrigue left. It just becomes ""Do this to be able to do this so I can do this"" etc.

Anyone else have a similar experience?

Metro: Exodus is my all time favorite game. However, on the hardest difficulty they disable manually saving, and require you to complete 2 30+ minute long stealth levels without getting spotted or killing anyone. Making it 80% through and then having to restart the whole process from scratch killed me. 

Second is DOOM(2016). I'm a proud member of r/patientgamers as it fits my busy lifestyle. I only recently got a chance to start this game. I grew up with doom PVP and unreal tournament. Thus far I'm loving the combat and chaos, BUT, I was expecting non-stop demon slaying. Not going more than 2 minutes without brutal demon slaughter. Unfortunately for me, the game really rewards thoughtful exploration, platforming, and inspecting every little corner of every map if you want to really get all the good shit. It takes away from the mindless fun because I'm constantly worried that I'm not getting the most out of the game. Honestly if it would have been more or a linear power fantasy I'd be so much more satisfied.

Couple of minor restrictions. The less reading the better, and he can get frustrated pretty easily. So, I'm basically looking for a kids game, where it's all but impossible to lose, and the controls are very simple, that would appeal to someone retirement age. 

Assuming they all still work, I've got an OG/360/One, and PS2 & PS4 stashed back there. Think I also have an N64 and GC, and I may even still have my 3DS around here somewhere. Ideally I'm looking for titles that could be found in like the bargain bin of a GameStop type store, so they're cheap and if he doesn't like them it's no big loss, but digital isn't out of the question on the One/PS4.

I've always been more of a sci-fi guy myself, so when I saw The Surge was free on PS+ a while back, I decided to try it, and I absolutely LOVED it - first (and sadly only) Souls-like I've ever beaten.

Nearing the end of my second full playthrough of the game, and I find myself really wanting more of this specific genre of the genre. I know there's a sequel to The Surge that I've already got plans to play, as well as some shaky-but-decent reviews of Hellpoint, but I don't really know of any other Souls-like games with a sci-fi setting. Are there just not that many out there, or am I missing something?",2025-04-23 08:55:51,gaming,gaming,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,7,21,,0.62,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1k5ugac/any_room_for_scifi_soulslikes/,toxicrystal
1ju1y0a,reddit,Looking for game recommendations similar to Hollow Knight.,"So I am looking for games with similar gameplay to Hollow Knight. It was my first metroidvania. Currently stuck trying to beat Pantheon 5 though.

I have played both Ori games and found the second to be the best. The fighting mechanics weren't my favorite but it was fun. The movement abilities to make exploring faster was great.

I am almost done with Nine Sols. At the final boss. The game is enjoyable more than it is not, but after going back to Hollow Knight after a few weeks of this game made me appreciate Hollow Knight more. The fighting just feels so much more smooth compared to Nine Sols.

I tried Animal Well. Was not my favorite and dropped it before beating it.

I have played other platformers. Downwell was great, leap year was a little enjoyable. I played Webbed. Was trying to 100% it, never beat it. I did not like how hard it was to back track in the tree area...

I currently have Celeste, Blade Kitten (played, like, haven't beaten yet), Inside, Limbo.

But I know none of them have gameplay similar to Hollow Knight. It doesn't have to be a Metroid or Platformer or 2D. Just more games with fast and smooth boss fights like Hollow Knight would be appreciated.

Should probably mention I currently only have a PC.",2025-04-08 01:29:34,gaming,gaming,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,8,107,,0.56,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1ju1y0a/looking_for_game_recommendations_similar_to/,AtticusSpindel

1k1h9kz,reddit,Does anyone know of game journal/diary apps?,"I honestly had no idea where to go for this and all my searches have turned up the wrong things so far so maybe you guys might know something I don’t. Something I would really like to find if at all possible is an app on either iOS or Android (I have an iPhone and a Galaxy Tab) where I can write\* my own journal entries and keep track of various things while I play. I really struggle a lot these days with games especially with games of my favourite genre of RPGs, and I really need things that can help me manage my memory.

I know that things like Notion or even the notes app exist but they don’t really seem to have what I’m looking for. The closest I’ve seen is something like Shattered Ring for Elden Ring. One of the things that makes apps like Notion less ideal is how they are set up and layed out. Also Shattered Ring is more specific and I am hoping to find something that can be used across games. Either it would be generic enough while still game focused or it would be able to change its setup per game. A final thing I’m hoping to find is the ability to Dictate to the app from the lock or Home Screen via a shortcut or widget. This would mean I could easily talk my thoughts as I am playing without having to stop and type.

Thanks for listening to this odd one and hopefully someone out there knows of something that will work

1jztbpv,reddit,A REVELATION: The movie Gremlins and Ape Escape,"I can't believe that there has not been a (modern) video game for Gremlins. In addition to this, I also think that Ape Escape's type of gameplay is almost perfect for a Gremlins game, give or take a few changes to the mechanics. Check it:

\- In Ape Escape, you run around capturing apes that have been let loose and are running and hiding across several maps. Swap out the apes with gremlins (duh), instead of capturing apes, you're killing gremlins, make the main character (Billy or Kate, each who have a skill that the other does not), and make the maps different locations from the films and a few more places.

\- Like Ape Escape, it would be a third-person view so you can see the character model you're playing as. Shit, add a photo mode with fun poses and faces so you can take photos of yourself with the different gremlins you're hunting!

\- Ape Escape is a kid-friendly game whereas Gremlins is, of course, a dark comedy/monster movie. The game should absolutely be the same, with the jokes, language, and violent ways of dispatching gremlins (Blender, guns, electricity, traps, sunlight, etc.) the monster violence would be gratuitous and over the top, just like in the movies. 

\- Think of all of the different gremlin designs throughout all the movies! Mogwai (duh), The spider, the bat, Mohawk, Greta, Stripe, Daffy, the vegetable gremlin, and all of the other ones I can't remember... Some of them could be level bosses or can only be caught in specific ways (like in Ape Escape, where some run and hide, some attack, and others just run around)

\- You could have a level where after you rescue Mogwai (perhaps a final level), there's a gremlin (boss) that is spraying water at you and you have to avoid getting Mogwai wet -- If you get hit with water more gremlins spawn from him. In order to beat the level, you have to kill all of the gremlins and the boss. 

\- There can be little side missions to do on every level: rescue NPCs from gremlins, find old books and ancient artifacts that show gremlins throughout history, collect multiple weapon parts to build a special weapon for each level, prevent a gremlin from touching water in time to avoid more gremlins spawning, etc.

\- The levels could be the many different locales from the movies: Billy's house/neighborhood, the movie theater, the Clamp Center lab, the YMCA, the bank, New York City, etc. 

Thank you for reading my video game pitch. I will happily accept a position at your game development studio now.

We are now working on a setting book, which we aim to make compatible with as many TTRPG systems as possible, that brings the high speed post apocalyptic fantasy of *Mad Max* and the Sci-Fi/Magic epic of *DUNE* together into one desert meteor crash site known to all as ***Scorched Basin***.

What are your favourite aspects of Mad Max and/or DUNE? What would you hope to capture in your world if you were in our shoes?

The Fleet Commanders relaying orders to try and capture the Leviathan class titan before it can get out, the continuous escalation of forces on both sides, the music, and the sheer visual spectacle!

It made me aware of EVE Online at the time, after which I played it for a good few years. And I keep returning to it to enjoy it again. It has almost become a comfort video of sorts.

Me and my partner have been playing Project Zomboid where we set a location as a target where they must get to while the other person hunts them down. We set a couple challenges like she has to find 3 items before she can enter the final location to get to the finish line etc.

1k2l85e,reddit,How no HUD-mode made a average game a great one. [Avowed],"When Avowed released about 2 months ago I played it because I was looking for a new game to scratch my RPG itch. I put it down after 10 hours and felt like it was realy avarage but solid.

I enjoyed it's meele combat especialy with the classic board and sword loadout. It took some time getting used to the whole combat system but while simple on the surface it has some depth to it. Timing to blocking/parrying is crucial and you have to pick your fights wisely.

Fast forward to today and I felt like picking it up again, hopped in and checked the games settings because I upgraded my graphics card and were about to adjust them when I acciendently stumbled upon the UI/HUD settings. To immersive myself more into the game I decided to turn off all HUD elements and gave it a spin and oh boy the game experience was soooo much better!

No longer got I distracted by all the HUDs elements and also it was really refreshing to experience a game's world with out getting your hand hold.

Previously I played Ghost of Tsushima which reduces your HUD to a minimum and while traversing the map is complete without a HUD and I felt like it was a bold but great decision by it's devs.

So my conclusion to this post is that more game devs should design there games with a minimum of HUD elements or even without one.

Also looking for some recommendations for games that are best enjoyed without a HUD.",2025-04-19 01:41:01,gaming,gaming,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,1,16,,0.51,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1k2l85e/how_no_hudmode_made_a_average_game_a_great_one/,P4nzerf4hrerKl4us

1jzoxjx,reddit,Crisis Core/Valhalla Knights Like Games,"Final Fantasy 7: Crisis Core and Valhalla Knights both share a gameplay style that I really don't ever see anymore. They're both 3d maps where you go to a ""dungeon"" (yes, a ""field dungeon"" is still a type of dungeon) and encounters are visible on the map (so far this is consistent with most FF games) where you can dodge encounters, find chests, and do quests. An important aspect of what I am looking for is that the combat is NOT turn based, even if its real time turn based. 

I've been playing through Valhalla Knights recently and its really scratching an itch, but I'd love to see if anyone knows of any newer games that have the same gameplay style. The first Valhalla Knights has a decent amount of content to it (easily 40 hours of gameplay to complete, though it does get pretty repetitive and grindy), but there is almost NOTHING but combat. Also, its not exactly smooth. I find the movement gums up frequently, and there is a lot of ""walk in circles till you find the quest goal, teleport back to town, and then walk back a mile to do it 2 more times"". 

It's been a hot minute since I played Crisis Core, but I doubt I'll be able to really get back into it for a while, since It'll be a while before I drop 50 bucks on a single player game in this economy for the remake, and the existence of the remake will make it harder to touch the original for a bit.

To be honest, I don't even think that I want another of this type of game for a bit, but I want to know of them if they exist. it's a fun little niche. Valhalla Knights has evoked a lot of the same vibes that I feel from the indie games in the Fire Emblem niche, and I'd love to see a new one come out, but since its the same studio as story of seasons, I have no idea if they'll ever touch the IP again, or if the people that worked on it are even still around.

Maybe something like comics using photo mode or something, which could be cool.

Hell, to go even further, imagine using a motion-tracking camera to record your own animations and emotes (give the Kinect something to do for Xbox and PC players...). Instead of having animation skills, you just record yourself with a Kinect or whatever-Sony-has.

The combat, world design and the dark fantasy aesthetic are up there with other non-Fromsoft greats like Lies of P, imo.

Saw its on sale at $20 on Steam at the moment & would definitely recommend for any DS1/Bloodborne/Lies of P/Soul Reaver fans.

1k59jcp,reddit,"Looking for games with smooth, challenging, immersive combat","This is random but I’m just curious if there’s anything out there I’ve missed out on. My favorite combat system by far is God of War, and I’ve yet to find a game that gets even close to the level of creativity and expressiveness you can have with combat in those games. I love souls games and just beat Elden Ring but compared to GoW the dodging system and animations just feel clunky. It feels like I’m playing a video game. I love souls for the challenge aspect but for me it’s not remotely as fun and expressive as GoW. I played ER as a mage trying to mix it up a bit from souls and that was probably a mistake as I ended up just spamming the same spell 90% of the time, but still. I’ve never played Sekiro and everyone raves about the combat so I’ll try it, but I’ve never been blown away by Fromsoft combat. Playing Bloodborne after GoW for example felt like I was playing something from the early 2000s, and it’s only 3 years older than GoW. 

Anyway bring on the downvotes, but other combat systems I’ve enjoyed are Horizon Zero Dawn, Zelda BoW, and if I recall I actually liked the soulslike combat in Code Vein more than actual souls games, but it’s been a minute. I just got the new Horizon game, and the Elden Ring DLC, but I’m curious if anyone has any other recommendations.

We like games with a feeling of progression and teamwork. I like goals to complete. We like the progression survival games offer, but are wary of the monotony.

Risk of rain 2 Pros:

looks good because of gameplay, teamwork, definite direction/goal, sense of progression. cheap right now.

cons: minimal permanent progression, worried about monotony, bullet sponge bosses.

Helldivers 2 pros: gameplay looks very fun, upgrades and ship upgrades permanent. looks like so much fun on gameplay videos

cons: if its better with >2 people, may be difficult as my internet isnt great with handling larger online games. worried the lack of story may mean it feels a bit like cod? expensive.

Enshrouded pros: we both like survival games (i have 225 hrs on 7 days to die), this game has the most definite/permanent progression, looks really cool. friend already owns it.

cons: lack of clear main story, open world and survival aspect may make it seem grindy/slow/pointless, may get boring after a while if so. early access, worried about bugs. as a survival game, progression may be quite slow.

1jvfzi3,reddit,Favorite OST That Others Dislike,"What is your favorite song(s) from any video game that you're pretty sure most other people dislike?

For me, it's probably the Sims 1 OST. 

I used to play Sims 1 around the time it was brand new (I don't think I was old enough to have started school yet when I started playing) and I remember liking the songs back then. Seeing the expectations and patterns that a lot of kids prefer now compared to back then, I find it difficult to believe anyone born after 2008 would appreciate anything Sims-related pre-3. Idk, I haven't looked into demographics so it's all just a wild guess. By that logic though, I could just list every game I've played that was released before 2002. Aside from nostalgia, Sims 1 music has a charm that's definitely been ramping up to eventually release games with amazing OST like Urbz: Sims in the City (released shortly after Sims 2). I haven't played all of the games, but I was absolutely disappointed with Sims 4.

1jqqll3,reddit,Have game boxes gotten uglier this generation?,"So among the discourse around the Switch 2 (please don't make this topic about that we have enough of those) one point of contention was that the big red banner at the top of the box is a bit of an eyesore compared to the smaller Switch 1 logo. I don't disagree, but thinking about it, I feel like in general game boxes aren't what they used to be.

The PS5 boxes, while probably the least egregious of the current gen systems, I feel aren't quite as good as the PS4's. I think the bright white color scheme just clashes with boxart more often than the blue color scheme of the PS4 did. And the current XBOX banner isn't much better than the Switch 2's. Do you suppose this is just a product of the more minimalist logos companies are using that they have to use more garish colors to set themselves apart, or is it a different trend altogether? Back in Gen 6 everyone was using black borders but with more stylized logos with distinct fonts, but we don't see that as much now.",2025-04-03 18:45:43,gaming,gaming,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,0,22,,0.44,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1jqqll3/have_game_boxes_gotten_uglier_this_generation/,lordlaharl422

My dream to get an esportler was so big, that I never gave up and I played hours upon hours for nothing. But I realised, that this shit isn’t for me . I don’t want to sit in front of my pc until 3am and i don’t want to play everyday so that I lose my interests in other things in life. Competitive games are completely manipulative, ngl. But not for me. I want to start playing games, that are worth it. No Micro-Microtransactions, no ranked grind. I want to explore, fight, loot, build and most-I want to have fun after all these years.

1k20rav,reddit,Why isn't there more focus on pure simulation this generation?,"For all the leaps and bounds we've had in processing power over the last 2 - 3 generations of consoles, I feel like devs haven't focussed enough on the things that would really push gaming to the next level. There was a time that games were blowing our minds constantly for doing something new and unique. Metal Gear has always made huge leaps forward with every entry. Red Faction and Battlefiled gave us amazing destruction. Half Life 2 is still impressive a little over 20 years later. We all have that series that we wish was still going or at the very least influenced other devs to iterate on a great gameplay mechanic. So my point is, why aren't there more narrative driven open world immersive sims? Like Freeguy which is basically GTA online but with a persistent destructable map with a realtime day night cycle? It wouldn't even have to be present day. You could go past, present or future here. You could do so much with a small town full of unique characters all with thier own lives and a friend/ enemy gossip system. Like Fargo or Breaking Bad as an immersive sim would be NUTS. I just want convincing AI, physics and destruction/ rebuilding with a great story tying it all together. What do you guys think?

1jtbddv,reddit,Somewhat Chill game(s) with decent story and engaging gameplay. (Console),"I'm going to be ""out of commission"" for a short time, and need something that's not too tense to play. I'm not asking for no combat, but maybe something with relatively easy or not very strenuous.  Like this would be a good time to play Warzone, but that or any multiplayer games like that would be a bit too much with needing the quick reactions.

I want something fun and engaging to play, preferably with an interesting story. I don't want a game like Minecraft, Stardew Valley, Unpacking, or Telltale games. Games that I would consider somewhat ""chill"" and not too tense would be games like GTA, Call of Duty and Halo single players. And although I only brought up shooters, it doesn't have to be shooters. Like I'll play some Balatro during this time for sure.

I would also prefer not a super long game, but also not super short. One game I could see being suggested that unfortunately wouldn't be good suggestion (for me), is Skyrim. Skyrim like games just have not really captured me. I've tried a few times and it's just never hooked me. I don't think those type of games are bad, They just have never been able to keep my interest.

I'll be needing to lay on a couch, so I would need this to be for consoles and since I would most likely need to buy it digitally, if I don't already own it or it's on Game Pass, it'd be preferable that it's on newer consoles. Any of the newer consoles.

1js52us,reddit,Games where you can figure out the “good” ending on first play-through?,"I’ve been playing through Look Outside and I’m really enjoying it, but it got me thinking about how many games there are with multiple endings where it’s possible to figure out the “good” or “right” ending on first go.

It seems to me that *most* games with multiple endings don’t necessarily make it easy to find the good ending on first go and I’m sure that’s partly a deliberate choice to keep players coming back. In any case, I was interested to hear of favourite examples of games that give you a reasonable chance of getting the “good” ending on first try?

A few caveats for the sake of discussion: 

* Obviously just talking about games that are sufficiently complex and don’t come down to a final singular decision to decide the ending.

* Also, excluding “perfect” or “better than good” endings or anything that’s generally deliberately hard to get, requires some fore-knowledge of the story or are literally locked on first play-through.

So which games do you think are good examples of this? Conversely, what are the most egregious examples of games where you can’t do this?

I’ve tagged the thread as spoilers of course because I imagine there will be some discussion of specific plot points in said games.

So which is more important? If it's story, then many many AA and indies games should be scoring at the same level as AAA titles. If it's gameplay, then many AAA titles should be scored much harsher.

Just, I find it strange that indie and smaller titles can at times get praise for their story, but still get a low score because the gameplay is the weakest part; While big budget titles can have weak gameplay yet still score nearly 9's and 10s simply because the story is great.

1k4q0av,reddit,"What are some games that would be better WITHOUT experience and level systems? (excluding Battle passes, account levels, and other player retention BS)","RPG style level-up systems often get alot of praise for being a really easy way to add a sense of progression to a game but I think there's plenty of times where they actively hinder the experience, and it be better without them.

Again, this is **NOT** referring to Battle passes, or account levels that just artificially board you from content so you're forced to grind.  This stuff is done for ""player retention"" metrics so they're tacked on because of corporate reasoning.  I want to hear games where the devs put in levels so you can unlock new skills or raise your stats, but it would've been better if those levels weren't there at all.

For example, in Street Fighter 6's world tour mode, your created character having a level actually makes it harder to gather dyes from random enemies, since they often require you hitting them with certain attacks, and they can easily DIE before you reach the goal needed to get the item you need.  

Another example is Sonic and the Secret Rings which has an EXP and Level system where you can equip more abilities as you complete levels.  However, every ability is either useless, should be standard, or in some rare cases, actually hinder your ability to control Sonic (primarily with homing attack lock-on range during enemy hunt missions, and whatever's making me overshoot rails when I try to jump off them).

1jyntup,reddit,"The struggle is real: modern gaming woes, what's been your biggest issue lately?","Hey fellow gamers, I wanted to start a discussion about the real struggles we all face in modern gaming. Whether it's technical issues, microtransactions, or just trying to find time to game in our busy lives, it seems like we all deal with something. Here are a few things I’ve been dealing with lately:

1.Endless Updates: You finally get some time to play, but then your game needs a huge update that takes hours to download. You’re just sitting there waiting while everyone else is playing. Not fun.

e.g. Call of Duty (any recent title)

Every time a new update drops, it feels like you're downloading an entire new game. You boot up for a quick match, and boom 120GB update. Game night = postponed.

2.Microtransactions and Pay2Win Mechanics: I don’t mind buying cosmetics, but when a game’s progression feels locked behind paywalls, it gets frustrating. Especially when it impacts the gameplay experience.

e.g. NBA 2K series

This franchise is notorious for pushing microtransactions in MyCareer mode. If you don’t spend money on VC, your player feels useless online for a long time. And it’s not a quick grind.

3.Servers and Connectivity: Getting dropped from a multiplayer match because of server issues, especially right before you’re about to win, is just the worst. It's like the universe conspires against your victories.

e.g. Battlefield 2042 (launch period)

At launch, the server issues were so bad that players were being disconnected constantly. And even when you got in, bugs were everywhere. It’s gotten better, but that launch period was brutal.

4.Toxic Communities: Some online communities just aren't fun anymore. There's nothing like the stress of getting yelled at for ""being bad"" in a casual game, or dealing with trolls in every match.

e.g. League of Legends

Even people who love the game admit it can be incredibly toxic, especially for newer players. The learning curve+pressure+trash talk=not always a good time.

5. Game Lengths: I don’t know about you, but sometimes I just want a good game that I can finish in a few hours without feeling like I’m being dragged through hours of filler content.

e.g. Assassin’s Creed Valhalla

Great game, beautiful world but there’s so much to do. Side quests, collectibles, upgrades, minigames… it can start feeling like a second job rather than fun.

Above mention problems I could think of 1 game that is good. Hades, no microtransactions. Tight gameplay. Polished and complete at launch. You can finish it in a reasonable amount of time, and it respects your time while being super replayable.

So what about you? What’s your biggest issue with modern gaming? Or do you have any clever solutions to combat these frustrations? Let’s talk about it.

I know I could get a Gamecube etc. but I really dunno why there is still at least no MP2 by now and i will wait to play MP4 until having played the other 2 games. also disappointed that Mario Galaxy 2 was still not released :(.

1jp6dyq,reddit,What's the best games adaptation of an anime?,"I was thinking today about how anime games usually skim over a lot of the story because they're made for people who have already seen every episode. Sparking Zero is great example, as it even removed an entire arc of the Super anime.

It makes sense that a potentially 100+ hour story would need to be trimmed, but it's unfortunate how often the result is a bastardized, truncated mimicry of the original writing.

So, I pose a question to r/gaming: what is the best anime adaptation of an *anime.* Specifically in regards to the story. Lots of anime spin off games capture the experience of the setting, mostly in regards to combat, so the question is specifically not asking what the most fun adaptation game is. 

As a bonus question, what spin off game has the best original story? It's not uncommon for anime spin off games to just come up with a whole new story, though the writing usually isn't very good.

Honorable mentions include Warframe (a little too arcadey), Skyrim's Dragon Armor shout (no gunplay, but fixable with mods), Resident Evil 4 Remake (cool tactical outfits and combat but no armor), Helldivers 1 (cool combat but not as cool armor) and the Dead Space franchise.

I guess framegen and DLSS might help get us there, but if the headroom is there to run a game at 120fps, I'd rather limit it to 60 and save the battery life. I'd have been much more excited by an OLED screen running at 60fps.

During that time in CSGO i could literally just cheat and the only thing I'd have to worry about is to not be blatant on the spectators so that they would not vote kick me, but VAC itself literally does nothing on my ass as it could only watch in horror as I hack ingame. The cheat I used in question was also free, and I don't spend money on such things. If I were to attempt the same thing in let's say, Valorant or Fortnite, I would get BANNED in an instant.

Now that with COD Warzone and Verdansk 2025 is out, and people are STILL CHEATING like haywire, I'm wondering if they should just go ham and do what Riot did with Vanguard, or if they should find other ways of cleaning the game up.

I believe (now on the fence about this) that it's still super effective against cheaters at the cost of privacy as well as excluding players such as on Linux (especially Steam Deck) and GeForce NOW (I'm the latter) due to it's intrusive nature.

I don't cheat anymore, that shit was a dark era of the pandemic days in my past, but with Warzone and the cheating epidemic I've been thinking of this a lot.",2025-04-04 10:26:29,gaming,gaming,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,0,37,,0.35,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1jr8mb7/if_intrusive_kernellevel_anti_cheat_is_not_the/,karuraR

So let's have an exercise: a major company decided to develop a new game for the SNES. But using the budget for an AAA game.

  
It needs to run on a SNES, so it must obey the software limitations. Maybe, for this exercise, we can consider a customized cartridge for bigger memory space for assets.

1jyawe9,reddit,Open-World vs. Non-Linear,"Hi all!

Yesterday I hopped into a discussion on the direction of open-world games in the industry. What I see a lot of in the comments of that discussion are people using open-world and non-linear interchangeably. To me, these are not the same. However, it definitely depends on one’s definition of those two concepts.

As an example, I argued that Majora’s Mask is open-world, but someone else disagreed with it being considered a true open-world game.

Then there’s the linearity. Is an open-world game non-linear by definition? To me, it isn’t. An example is Marvel’s Spider-Man. Undeniably open-world, but very much a linear game, the way I see it.

Furthermore, is a non-linear game open-world by definition? I also say no to this. A game like The Walking Dead is non-linear to me. However, it’s certainly not open-world.

What are your definitions? How do you view these two genres as they relate to each other?

EDIT: Super cool to see the different perspectives. Something that’s abundantly clear so far is that my definition of linearity is a bit narrow. I like the idea of narrative linearity and level linearity. Something like The Walking Dead is (of course) linear in terms of level structure; you can’t choose when you want to progress the narrative. However, it’s non-linear in a narrative sense. On a separate note, to those of you trying to argue that open worlds have to be “large maps,” good luck to you. It seems there are lots of others that agree with you, but I certainly don’t.",2025-04-13 15:58:00,gaming,gaming,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,0,65,,0.41,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1jyawe9/openworld_vs_nonlinear/,Bee892

But coming back to replay Bioshock 2 recently, I couldn't help but reassess my views. The game felt generally forced and contrived, almost like a caricature at times of the first, an obligatory sequel that somewhat tarnishes the legacy of a classic.

Here are some tips to be ready for online retail war!,"If you're planning to brave the Nintendo Switch 2 launch (despite the overpriced games), here are some tips to have the best chances of competing with the scalpers and other enthusiastic gamers like yourself!

1. Make sure you have yourself signed into all major retailers (Target, Walmart, Best Buy, Amazon, etc) on as many devices as safely possible. Utilize passkeys & biometrics where ever possible to minimize the amount of time it takes you to sign in.

2. Make sure you have your preferred payment method set up as **default** on those sites. 

3. Avoid payment methods, such as PayPal, that require you to be bounced back and forth between sites.  Remember, middle-man financial services like PayPal will be hammered as well.

4. Walmart tip: The site allows you to link a bank account for payments. If you're comfortable with that, it cuts out the need to connect to a credit card company to access your funds.

5. Obviously, get yourself signed into *all* the retail sites you want to try on all devices. It might be worth it to have WiFi turned off on at least one of your mobile devices because many sites handle network traffic from cellular differently than over normal TCP/IP. Those channels might be a bit less bogged down.

1joanc0,reddit,"For competitive fps gaming, does physical distance from your screen matter at all or just field of view?","What i'm asking is, is there an advantage to being on a small screen and sitting very close over a large tv farther away?


Trying decide whether to get the 83"" S85D ($1800 at av dudes) or the higher quality 77"" S90D ($2200 most places). S90D is a QD-Oled that is brighter (room does get a bit bright for my 11 year old 300 nit LG a few hours out of the day), has better colors, and 144Hz instead of 120Hz. I think if i get the 77"", i will be slightly too far away on my couch and will end up switching input to a smaller, older screen i will have next to it for when i need a desk for rts type games. I think the 83"" will be big enough not to feel the need to do this unless there is some type of inherent advantage of being closer regardless of field of view. Obviously, I will feel it if it exists. I'm going to be doing just ps5 for everything but Age of Empires (which i will play on the smaller screen with the desk) until there is a graphics card that can do 4k60 with raytracing for a price that doesn't want to make me puke. My gtx 970 is good enough for age of empires, and i don't feel anything short of 4k60 with raytracing will be a big enough upgrade over ps5 to be worth the upgrade. Is the 144Hz worthwhile over 120Hz for pc gaming? I have heard you should have at least 60 base frames to get a good experience with frame gen. Nothing is going to run at exactly 60, so 65 or 70 would result in going above the refresh rate if it is 120. Will this cause tearing or does that only happen when the fps is below the refresh rate of a screen that does not have VRR?

1k5wgnq,reddit,Skyrim veteran here—thinking of diving into Oblivion. Is it worth it and how does it really compare?,"Hey everyone! I’m a big fan of the Elder Scrolls series and I’ve sunk way too many hours into Skyrim over the years. I’ve been hearing great things about Oblivion - REMASTERED -, but I’m on the fence about whether it’s actually “better” or just different.

A few things I’m curious about:

1. World & Exploration – How does Cyrodiil’s map and atmosphere compare to Skyrim’s? Does it feel as alive?


2. Story & Quests – I loved Skyrim’s civil war storyline and the Dragonborn main quest. How’s Oblivion’s main plot and guild content?


3. Character Progression – I heard Oblivion’s leveling system is more skill-based and less “grindy.” Is that true, and does it make leveling more meaningful?


4. Combat & Gameplay – Skyrim’s combat feels smooth and cinematic. Does Oblivion’s combat hold up, or will I feel like I’m fighting with buttered noodles?


5. Mods PS5 & Quality-of-Life – Are there must-have mods that bring Oblivion up to modern standards (graphics, UI, etc.) for the PS5?

I don't care how good the game is or if the launcher is actually decent, fuck every developer who thinks they need to push their bs on me.

Edit: since I wasn't clear, I am talking about publisher specific launchers, not steam. ",2025-04-23 07:09:18,gaming,gaming,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,0,66,,0.38,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1k5t0qx/whats_a_hill_you_will_die_on/,Insane_Unicorn
1k36wi3,reddit,Regarding Respawn Entertainment,"I just saw the trailer for Star Wars: Zero Company and while it does look promising, I have to wonder why it was Respawn that was relegated to this particular project. They are the developers of one of the best First-person shooters on the market, Titanfall, as well as the breakout Apex Legends, and yet they're using that talent for third-person adventure and turn-based strategy games.

Now,  I'm not saying that talent is being wasted. Quite the contrary. I know the Jedi games are well-received and Apex is a money-maker regarding the free-to-play model.

However, personally, I am itching for a new Titanfall or even a new IP FPS. (As long as it isn't a hero shooter lol)",2025-04-19 21:32:16,gaming,gaming,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,0,7,,0.25,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1k36wi3/regarding_respawn_entertainment/,ElderberryStench

It seems to me that the combination of puzzles and roguelike randomness is a very strange combination in terms of audience targeting.

People who like to solve puzzles enjoy the ordering, love control, enjoy step-by-step progress that depends on the applied mental effort. Randomness completely destroys this flow.

1jwnv4x,reddit,The game price debate is just corporate gaslighting.,"I don't understand why so many people are defending these higher game prices that just keep going up.  
In a time where making games has never been more simple and accessible, literally everyone can create high quality games with free software and no programming knowledge.   
A time where Gaming is the largest and most profitable entertainment industry with the largest consumer base which is growing year by year.   
A time in which distributing video games is simpler and cheaper than ever.  
A time where some of the most popular video games have been made by one person or a small group of developers, putting AAA games to shame.  
  
It's all gaslighting by the big corporations that it couldn't be helped... inflation... costs going up... and so many other excuses.  
People need to realise that it's not the consumers problem when companies decide to spend millions on a polished turd and seem to be happy with creating aggressively mediocre games and then complain when people don't buy them.

They're playing the victim while making the consumer out to be the bad guy.

1juiifl,reddit,The volatility of one's online game account is saddening.,"Ubisoft, Microsoft accounts hacked and their support was extremely unhelpful, and flatout denied to do anything despite me collecting evidence all the way back from 2019.   
  
I had my Ubisoft, Microsoft, EA and Epic hacked in Feb while I was asleep and my PC was off. Woke up next morning, noticed my google account hacked and fixed it. Noticed that my Epic and EA were hacked right away (the Ubi and MS emails must've gone to Spam), and I got my account back in 30 minutes (despite the hacker having changed out the login e-mail ID).

I noticed my Ubi and MS account being gone in March. Oh-shit moment followed by a quick trip to their respective supports and opening a case. 10 days later, I had responses from both of them - Ubisoft somehow managed to verify my account, and then proceeded to NOT be able to verify my account and then decline the account recovery process. Microsoft also declined the recovery for similar bullshit reasons, both stating ""account security"", yada yada yada and whatnot.

  
I have purchased a couple of games in both the accounts, from my memory I've spent 60$ on each account totally in the games and DLC for them. I had a few thousand hours totally in each account playing Rainbow Six Siege, Crew 2, Breakpoint and on the MS side a ton of hours in Forza Horizon 4, some in minecraft and a few in Horizon 5. I have no CDs purchased to provide keys for (since I bought my PC in 2019 when CDs were more or less extinct). 2FA was enabled by email for all my accounts except the EA account. Launching Rainbow Six from my linked Steam account opens a login page for the Ubisoft launcher and doesn't log in to the account or launch the game.

  
Now, thankfully my Steam was untouched (which is where most of my games reside, and hooray for Steam Guard) but it still pains me to lose all these hours and games. What pains me more is the callousness of the support - they state vague reasons, refuse to explain everything and most of the times spew what looks like automated AI responses, which is HUGELY discouraging as a customer that has spent money on them (and can potentially spend money again on them if the support is good). 

It once again reinforces the idea that we don't own anything, anybody can take anything from you and support can take the hacker's side and be unhelpful - resulting in one losing things in the blink of an eye. Makes me less hopeful for the future of gaming, as things get more digital.
