mmxfwh3,1jy78z3,reddit,">As recently as 2014, Coachella owner Philip Anschutz, whose company Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) organizes the festival under its sister corporate entity Goldenvoice, has donated large amounts of money to homophobic organizations like Promise Keepers and The Navigators, according to Spin magazine.


>Just [in 2021] alone, Anshutz's donated $109,500 toward the National Republican Convention — which was $84,500 more than he did the year prior, according to OpenSecrets.org. ([in 2019], the 82-year-old donated $103,500 to the right-wing convention.)


>In 2021, Anschutz gave over $125,000 to the National Republican Congressional Committee; 2021 saw the owner of AGE send $36,500 to the National Republican Senate Committee. Not a single dollar of Anschutz's current $12 billion net worth has gone toward any democratic or independent candidate, committee, or campaign since 2004.


>Billboard was quick to note in 2020 that AEG Anschutz has donated $1.2 million over the past decade to two organizations that have made public statements against LGBTQIA+ people — Colorado Christian University and the Sky Ranch Christian camping organization. Anschutz's donations to many anti-LGBTQIA+ groups that were absent from 2017 tax filings were to alliances Southern Poverty Law Center has since deemed hate groups, such as the Alliance Defending Freedom, the ""pro-life, pro-marriage"" Family Research Council organization, and other anti-LGBTQIA+ organizations like Focus on the Family, the National Christian Foundation, and the Heritage Foundation.

ml9t4yn,1jqm9da,reddit,"* Kanye West, 47, seemingly confirms his split from Bianca Censori, 30, in a new song.
* Months of speculation about their relationship preceded the recording
* The track, simply titled ""Bianca,"" appears on his upcoming album, WW3, released April 2.
* West's lyrics suggest Censori left because of controversial social media posts and pleas for her return.

  
*“My baby she ran away / But first she tried to get me committed; Not going to the hospital ’cause I am not sick I just do not get it.”*

At another point in the song, Ye raps about Bianca, *“She’s having a panic attack and she is not liking the way that I tweeted / Until Bianca’s back I stay up all night I’m not going to sleep / I really don’t know where she’s at.”*",2025-04-03 21:34:17,1,rmusicmods,music

Comedian and musician Reggie Watts attended Coachella last weekend, and his experience was pretty dismal: too expensive, too much trash, too many brand activations and influencers, and not nearly enough soul, respect, and community spirit. He even likened the attendees to “walking credit cards.”

The festival just concluded its first weekend this past Sunday, and Watts has offered a review on social media. “I’ve been to Coachella a handful of times now, and while the scale is impressive, the soul feels increasingly absent,” Watts wrote on an Instagram post titled “Coachella Thoughts.” “The experience is confusing and impersonal — checkpoint after checkpoint, wristband logic puzzles, security everywhere. Most people on the grounds move like walking credit cards, pinging from one branded experience to the next,” he wrote.

He continued: “There’s no real sense of love coming from the festival toward the people. No care. No reverence. Just vibes curated for influencer culture. You’ll catch glimpses of something real — an artist pouring their heart out on stage, a sudden moment of connection — but those moments are fleeting. They’re easily lost in the chaos, buried beneath the logistics, the brand activations, the overpriced everything.”

Watts then turned to the amount of trash left behind at the festival, and why exiting Coachella can be particularly dismal. “And then there’s the waste — plastic, garbage, trash in the desert wind. Leaving is especially grim. You’re navigating dust storms, people hustling to buy your wristband, and a general sense that it was all a transaction, not a shared experience. If you’ve got asthma or care about your breathing, bring a mask. Seriously.”

He concluded his missive by championing independent festivals instead: “There are better ways to do this. There are independent festivals run by people who give a shit — about the music, the artists, the fans, the land. They treat performers with care and build environments where real community can take root. That’s where the magic is. That’s what’s wort supporting.” See Watts’ post below.

Watts raises some important questions about large, multi-genre festivals and their sense of community (or lack thereof), as well as their environmental impact. Last year, Consequence staffers discussed the changing festival landscape in a roundtable chat, and in 2023, we spoke with festival organizers large and small about what it would take to hypothetical build a carbon neutral festival.",2025-04-16 16:23:54,910,YoureASkyscraper,music

There are all kinds of people in the world, and as a music person, Coachella is absolutely still one of the best musical experiences you can have. 

I got to see the LA Philharmonic Orchestra with conductor Gustavo, and a bunch of cool guests, no chance that happens anywhere else. There were a bunch of really cool rock bands in the Sonora tent, julie, wisp, glixen, circle jerks, plus we got viagra boys + Amyl and the sniffers in one of the tents. 

Music festivals are what you make of them, if you’re not into the influencers, move away from them. There are 100,000 people there, 75-80 percent of these people are just regular people hanging out with their friends.

This was my 10th Coachella, and while it has definitely more expensive, and there is more of a look at me vibe then there used to be, but as a pure music experience, it’s hard to beat. The sheer number of acts I was able to see and enjoy, just cannot be matched.

Gone every year for the past 3 years, going in 2 days. Its fun as hell. Lots of stuff to do, lots of artist I've wanted to see and lots of new music to discover. I've made friends there that I'm excited to see this weekend. There's a ton of beautiful people wearing awesome outfits, festival food is PEAK, and its just a fun experience. I get to take pictures with my gf and we're all smiles all weekend. 

The idea that influencers enjoy something so I must hate it is such a juvenile mindset to have. The notion that artist connection is fleeting when every single artist I've ever seen has had large groups of people singing their hearts out along with whoever is on stage is ridiculous. 

I'm not saying Coachella is flawless, but we have this very silly and laughable cycle of something becomes popular with people so every needs people to know how much it sucks.

Please, PLEASEEEEEE, research the upcoming musicians you come across that you think sound good. Figure out their background and if they’re a humble beginnings type that started out small gigs and built their reputation off providing entertainment and skillful performances. 


A lot of these new pop and rock stars today are rich kids who had enough freetime to focus on their hobby as opposed to legitimate musicians who have to juggle work and real life like family or bills and still put out awesome music. 

The problem is we have music labels who overlook the upbringing and substance of one’s character and only want someone that is commercially viable and has visual appeal either a trend or sex appeal because yes if you’re hot you can bring in followers. I’ve seen countless bands gigging bars and venues competing with spoiled brats whose parents run the show for them who overshadow people who put in hard work just to show up and play their sets, while music labels scouting managers pick up the people who seem trendy, hip, or not ugly and give them a shot at providing a setlist of new original music over their own and end up going nowhere with what they make because they have no creativity or they can’t handle the audition traveling states away to play a competition at a bar and then get heckled to shit and realize they’re not hotshit or have the grit to run a show (been there on the sidelines watching two different bands fail their chances at getting picked up and the groups split because they realize they can’t go anywhere with what they have) 


 Industry Plants are a scourge to society, actual real bands with people who lived and experienced life translate their emotions into music unlike these wannabe rock/pop stars who just write about ambiguous love songs or boring immature “life is tough” songs that disconnect the audience because they can’t vibe to the lyrics along with the instrumentals.


You can find an actual Industry Plant on Reddit right now in the form of Grace Bowers on r/guitar , someone with decent guitar skills but not really impressive compared to thousands of other users who post here everyday. She got a Gibson guitar advertisement deal, a Jimmy Kimmel interview, [and so much more,](https://www.gracebowers.com/bio) after only putting in a couple years of social media posts. She moved from a different state so she could say she’s from Nashville, and her whole persona is obviously preconstructed from a PR team, her family has carried her through life to focus on a dream that so many other hardworking individual aspire to achieve and this chick gets it for being appealing to the masses even though she is not that amazing at guitar. 

She was awarded for skills that are subpar compared to SO MANY MORE PLAYERS HER AGE.

He’s also been increasingly fearful after hearing stories of visitors, US visa-holders, and applicants being held at the border, including a Vancouver woman who told the Guardian she was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for two weeks.

“I just thought if that’s happening to cis people, I really feel worried about what could happen to me,” Thomason says.

Trump, I may be one of those returning to America who is barred or put in jail to sleep on a cement floor with an aluminum blanket,” Young wrote. “That is happening all the time now. Countries have new advice for those returning to America. You can read about it at the CANADA Desk. If I come back from Europe and am barred, can’t play my USA tour, all of the folks who bought tickets will not be able to come to a concert by me.”  



>He continued, “That’s right folks, if you say anything bad about Trump or his administration, you may be barred from re-entering USA. If you are Canadian. If you are a dual citizen like me, who knows? We’ll all find that out together.”



>Young did not hold back on his feelings about the president, continuing, “If the fact that I think Donald Trump is the worst president in the history of our great country could stop me from coming back, what does that say for Freedom? I love America and its people and its music and its culture. … Remember Freedom of Speech?”



>The rocker’s missive continued: “By these latest actions of our US government, it seems that those who speak out freely with their own opinions are now vulnerable to a non-existent Trump law. Then it seems to me that if you voted for Kamala Harris over Trump, that makes it possible for you to go to jail or be detained, punished in some way for not showing allegiance to what? How spineless is that? Trump is not be able to stand up to anyone who does not agree with his ideas? Remember, all months have 30 days.”

mo0rm2r,1k2w9gd,reddit,"Nobody will read this but… having worked backstage on the main stages two years running with six acts… here’s why Coachella gets more tech issues than ACL or Lollapalooza. Coachella’s simulcast on YouTube is now more important to acts and their teams than just about any other performance. As such pop/hiphop acts pull out all stops just for this festival. And I don’t mean a few more backing singers and a few more lights. I mean giant, complicated, Hollywood backlot-style sets. Not just the six headliners either, anyone playing after 4pm is bringing in four semitrailers and a 20 man rigging crew. These acts are totally comfortable blowing $800k on one performance while making a net loss cos in real terms it’s a justifiable marketing expense (see: Beyoncé’s $2m extravaganza). 

Backstage at Coachella was always hectic but now it’s a logistical nightmare, huge sets jampacked together, leaving very little space for pre-micing things like drum kits. It’s like the Pepsi halftime show and universal studios for 16hrs a day. Acts also frequently add surprise guest performers with their own mic/IEM systems so there’s another crucial tech element to incorporate. 

The end result is that most acts are rocking a much more complicated setup than they would anywhere else, with a million moving pieces that are difficult to get on/off stage, and mostly cannot be soundchecked in advance. Playback systems with live autotune. Dancers with RF packs, thousands of channels of wireless audio. Million dollar lighting rigs. LED screen content built into sets. Despite having the best tech crew in the world, fuckups are just about inevitable. 

And any audio person will tell you… headset mics are just a fucking nightmare. I thought gagas performance was a technical triumph. And yet one tiny moment that most people in the audience missed results in this headline.",2025-04-20 01:14:54,292,dale_dug_a_hole,music

A minor celebrity
And so it only makes sense
The world would be obsessed
with every single thing you do
They're running 'round
With their camcorders in the night
They lurk impatiently
In hope in that they just might
See something real embarrassing you do
The bad hair day and sweat-stained t-shirt
That's the story that
They're gonna feature
With exclusive pics
Of your flabby behind
You think you're all alone
But that's right when you'll find
A bunch of paparazzi
Popping out of nowhere
Cameras in your face
And then suddenly
You're on TMZ
You're on TMZ
Following you
When you're walking down the street
And asking stupid questions
While you're trying to eat
So you cover your face
Thinking to yourself
""Hey, isn't this creepy?""
And they're out there praying
You'll have a big meltdown
And take 'em on a little car chase
Through this whole town
They'll be there with you
When you're going to jail
First on the scene
For every wardrobe fail
You just picked up some transvestite
Seconds later
It's up on the website
Get a vegas wedding
A quickie divorce
And they'll be sneaking in
Snapping pictures, of course
And if they ever catch you
Picking your nose
Or stumbling down the street
On a drunken spree
You're on TMZ
Stalking you, just waiting by your front door
Trailing you through airport security
They're with TMZ
They're with TMZ
Oh, let me tell you
It's getting to the point
Where a famous person can't
Even get a D.U.I
Or go on a racist rant
Those guys are all around
So you really shouldn't dare
Go to every club in town
If you've lost your underwear
Seems that every single time
A star decides to shave her head
Or ram their car into a tree
They're on TMZ
If they catch you peeing in the bushes
Later on, that night
Well, I guarantee
You're on TMZ
You're on TMZ
You're on TMZ
Every single celebrity
Knows they're gonna be
There on TMZ

Bit my tongue extremely bad and have a number of terrible bruises and I don't bruise easily. Nurses said I was very very close to death. My back hurts so much which sucks because I smoke weed and and every cough is excruciating for about 5 minutes until it starts helping. 

I'm calling drinking quits since I was so close to no longer being here. Had same habits as deadmau5 however I was averaging 3-4 hurricanes for months up until seizures (I'm only 105lb) Hadn't been eating much as well due to horrible dental issues so was getting temporary energy from alcohol.

I hope he gets help because it starts to become a matter of life and eventually death at that rate. Even though I went in on Friday; I've no memory of anything from the past week.

Anyone reading this; please take my words to heart if you're in a similar situation; you might not be as lucky as me.

mo1vaa0,1k3e0p4,reddit,"Ethan hawke relating Willie Nelson's 70th birthday backstage when Toby Keith got humiliated by Kris kristofferson.

https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/kris-kristofferson-last-outlaw-poet-ethan-hawke-interview-714098/

“What the luck did you just say to me?” Kris growled, stepping forward.

“Oh, no,” groaned Willie under his breath. “Don’t get Kris all riled up.”

“You heard me,” the Star said, walking away in the darkness.

“Don’t turn your back to me, boy,” Kristofferson shouted, not giving a shit that basically the entire music industry seemed to be flanking him.

The Star turned around: “I don’t want any problems, Kris – I just want you to tone it down.”

“You ever worn your country’s uniform?” Kris asked rhetorically.

“What?”

“Don’t ‘What?’ me, boy! You heard the question. You just don’t like the answer.” He paused just long enough to get a full chest of air. “I asked, ‘Have you ever served your country?’ The answer is, no, you have not. Have you ever killed another man? Huh? Have you ever taken another man’s life and then cashed the check your country gave you for doing it? No, you have not. So shut the fuck up!” I could feel his body pulsing with anger next to me. “You don’t know what the hell you are talking about!”

Ray Charles stood motionless. Willie Nelson looked at me and shrugged mischievously like a kid in the back of the classroom.

Kristofferson took a deep inhale and leaned against the wall, still vibrating with adrenaline. He looked over at Willie as if to say, “Don’t say a word.” Then his eyes found me.

“You know what Waylon Jennings said about guys like him?” he whispered.

I shook my head.

>Musician Alice Merton filed the lawsuit Tuesday in U.S. federal court, claiming Kanye used an ""unauthorized sample"" of her song ""Blindside"" on his tune ""Gun to My Head,"" which also features Ty Dolla $ign and Kid Cudi.

>In the suit, Merton says she wrote and recorded ""Blindside"" in 2022, and first learned Kanye sampled it when she heard his song ""Gun to My Head"" on his ""Vultures"" album in December 2023. Two months later, in February 2024, Merton says, Kanye requested to use her tune through BMG Rights Management, but she rejected it. Merton says BMG then emailed her to ask why she denied Ye’s request, and she responded that ""the artist’s values are contrary to our values.""  
  
>Merton also said she was particularly concerned about Ye’s ""anti-sematic \[sic\], racist remarks which were made publicly and continue to be made publicly.""",2025-03-26 14:42:29,1464,MarvelsGrantMan136,music

mlvu2wz,1jtnvc1,reddit,"Let's say an artist makes $2 each time someone buys their 12-song CD. Given the roughly $0.004 per stream paid by Spotify, the same album would need to be listened to 42 times to earn the same $2 in streaming. So yes, artists will get paid more if you buy their album because only superfans are likely to listen to your CD more than 42 times.

*However*, only about 1/3 of Americans still own a CD player (and even fewer own a record player), and CDs can be resold (unlike streams), so the question becomes ""will I make more money on one-time $2 transactions with a significantly smaller market, or $0.004 transactions with everyone who has internet access each time they listen?"" The answer comes down to whether you get really popular or remain, like most musicians, relatively unknown.

The difference here is that EVERYONE contributes to the artist when the listen on Spotify and they do every single time they listen.

Back in the day you might just borrow a friend's CD instead. Or ""Oh a new album dropped!"" Cool, most people aren't going to buy every album from every artist unless they really like them. But on Spotify, it costs you nothing extra to just throw it on and listen.

I met scooter, wacka, yung dolph, 2 chains, Andre 3000, Gucci, Migos pretty much all the big ATL rappers. Only 2 chains and Andre were like fully functioning adults

I quit because they were constantly bringing hardcore drugs and weapons in and out of the studio while I’m having meetings and then being stingy with paying for the work they asked for. Like bro yall are moving pounds of coke in plain view and then being cheap asses about some $2000 design projects and can’t even pay $500 for a rough draft to start?! 

Then these dudes end up shot or dying on a fucking fence post. …Like half the guys I worked with there are fucking dead now. You’re 39 and still running from the police? This dude was a fucking asshole in person. Can’t say I’m surprised or upset in the least. Get it how you live

>It prompted a backlash among some members of the punk band’s fanbase, but now the drummer has poked fun at the situation by wearing his response to Charli, as seen in a photo being shared on social media.

>The pic appears to have been taken backstage at the festival, captured by Cool’s wife Sara Rose Wright.

mosien0,1k6fwjp,reddit,"I have always wondered how in the world they figured they have the legal right to allow free access to copyrighted works. 

I think the labels have overreached in their lawsuit and could have just asked for anything they're currently commercially selling to be removed, but it doesn't seem like the Archive has much of a case here unfortunately.  I have a lot of my stuff up there, I did concert recordings for a couple decades and was happy that they were accepting things like that even though it was a semi-gray area.  I think labels/publishers did not like it, but the bands themselves were happy to have their shows archived (and plenty over the years have thanked me for it since sometimes they've done stuff they don't even remember).   

I think it's real shitty of the labels to not request a takedown if they know it's something they're selling even if nobody is buying.  It's kind of a slam dunk argument for them, if they own the copyright (and i feel like copyright has issues in general but the lawsuit isn't going to change that nonsense) and someone's giving it away for free in any medium without royalties or anything, that ain't great.  The Archive is not a library, and probably laws should change for the digital age but they probably won't.  

Kind of a bummer.  Signing a petition isn't going to stop a lawsuit.  Good lawyers donating their time might.  Record labels do not give a shit about customers, artists, libraries or anything but how to make money.",2025-04-24 14:10:26,16,MasterDave,music

According to Freedom House initiative Reporting Radicalism, the Black Sun is also used by some modern pagan and satanist groups as an esoteric symbol. They further note that it is sometimes used as a fashionable, aesthetic symbol, or misunderstood as having origins in ancient Scandinavian or Slavic cultures.[28] The Anti-Defamation League notes that though the symbol is popular with white supremacists, imagery resembling the black sun features in many cultures, and should be analysed in the context it appears, and not necessarily interpreted as a sign of white supremacy or racism.[5]

I think I’ve been an inspiration to many that if I could get sober, anyone can do it,” Flav wrote on Instagram stories. “But just when you think it’s easy, it ain’t. I briefly relapsed. I say this to admit my mistake and publicly hold myself accountable.”



>Flav has been open about his sobriety journey of the last few years and celebrated his four-year mark on World Mental Health Day by paying for fans’ online therapy. In a 2023 interview, he admitted he was spending up to $2,600 a day on drugs but would hide it from the public.

These people view skill as a problem.  If a worker, an artist, anyone has a skill that gives them a degree of power and agency because rich people need to pay them.  Stripping away the need for skill is not democratisation - it is the removal of power and meaning, because skilled engagement with the world is what gives people satisfaction with their lives, from ordinary people so the rich and soulless can live in their tacky mansions surrounded by the consumer masses.",2025-04-14 09:15:52,3,N/A,music

I could say some good things about AI in art, and a lot of critical things. In terms of music, I’ll simply say that I hope it can be used as a tool for creatives to break new ground.

The part of the ""process"" that musicians don't really enjoy is getting ripped off every step of the way by people wanting a slice of the pie without putting in any of the effort. I get that record labels want to recoup the production costs but artists make next to no money off of anything other than maybe touring, and even that is getting worse as ticket prices continue to skyrocket.

So rude and always negative

I need new friends, but it's not that quick and easy

I'm drowning, let me breathe

I'm better off all by myself

Though I'm feeling kinda empty without somebody else

I hear you crying out for help

But you never showed for me when I was ringing your cellphone

Oh, you don't know how it feels to be alone

Baby, oh, I'll make you know, I'll make you know""

https://www.reddit.com/r/boywithuke/s/R3YfMmPrf8

But anyway - I first heard 'toxic' while watching some streamer and they had it in the background and I thought huh that sounds interesting. Other good songs 

https://youtu.be/BY41k184qqo - problematic

https://youtu.be/NNGd3uANaes - sick of u (collab with oliver tree, another artist i love)

https://youtu.be/HHezQOZ_2xk - two moons

Anyway yeah he got famous on tiktok, he plays a uke, he has a mask, like a year ago he revealed his face, and i think he might be sick at the moment because he last video 'final tour' he talks about getting food poisoning and stuff so idk he might be on medication affecting him

Don't know what to think, hope someone uploads a video soon that I can watch but feels like all the comments here are just saying they haven't heard of him and he looks like blah which is funny because he originally had the led mask so people would judge his music and not his appearance

Anyway I'm not like a massive fan, just was shocked by this post popping up and I listen to his songs sometimes when I'm feeling in the mood. Hope the fans who spent money to see the show were happy",2025-04-08 16:47:35,4,DavoDivide,music

mm1xaxs,1ju79lu,reddit,"I'm going to provide a bit of context here for the people who don't know anything about The Warfield since OP conveniently left it out of their story. 

I'm a touring sound engineer who used to live in San Francisco, and I have been working /attending shows there since the late 1980's.

The Warfield is in the Mission District and has always been a bit rough but not as bad as it is now. 

I was there last year. 

When you load in a show there, you park your equipment truck(s) on Taylor St closest to the venue and your busses on the other side of the street. As you unload the equipment, you line up the gear that can't go into the venue immediately  on the sidewalk and the street. 

You have to keep an eye on the equipment outside at all times as the local citizens will try to steal it. 

I'm not going to sugarcoat it. That area is fucking gross. 

Some highlights from my last time there:

As soon as I got off of our bus, I was greeted by the smell of human shit as there was a nice pile of it on the sidewalk. 

Used needles litter the doorways and gutters outside the venue. 

Open drug deals everywhere. They don't even try to hide it as they know SFPD won't do anything about it. 

A shirtless man yelling at what appeared to be a pile of cream corn (it wasn't cream corn)

Our merchandise person walked to a store and saw a guy laying in a doorway jerking off.

But even if you did, Boywithuke has ALWAYS pushed his merchandise at every show...people look forward to his merch song! Also, that kid was being very disrespectful and Boywithuke displayed a great deal of restraint and patience with him. Then there are your complaints about lipsyncing. Seriously? Have you ever seen Taylor Swifts shows? Or pretty much any of the cookie-cutter crap-show celebrities like her? They all lipsync and practically NONE of them can play an instrument or write lyrics or music to save their lives! At least he writes his own music and lyrics!!  And he does sing live most of the time in concert!! 
 Also, he did not ask people to throw gifts to him! This was a problem a couple of years ago and that was stopped then! If someone decides to throw up a sweatshirt on their own, that is not at his request and the person got it back! Plus, yea, he probably shouldn't have joked about the Tenderloin District like he did, but it was a joke nonetheless and it was just a lead up to his story of having been inspired to write his song ""Corduroy"" because of his time spent in the Tenderloin district when he was in the Bay Area a couple of years ago. One last thing, being from Hawaii, I take major offense to people insulting others who play the ukulele!! But Boywithuke does NOT just play the ukulele!! He also plays the guitar, piano, and the cello, PLUS he now has a band behind him and just as an FYI, he was classically trained starting with the violin and piano beginning at the age of 4!!

>1995, Yolanda Saldivar was convicted of Murder with a Deadly Weapon and sentenced to life in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice-Institutional Division. She was required to serve 30 years before becoming eligible for parole consideration. Her parole eligibility date is March 30, 2025, meaning that she could be released no earlier than that date.

>As with any other initial review of an offender for parole, approximately six months prior to her parole eligibility, she went into the parole review process. An Institutional Parole Officer prepared her file for submission to the parole panel responsible for rendering the discretionary decision. Within that confidential file there is a plethora of information including but not limited to: court documents, offense reports, support/protest information, criminal history, institutional adjustment and information/statements provided by the offender. The file was then sent to a parole panel of three. A simple majority was required to either grant or deny parole.

>After a thorough consideration of all available information, which included any confidential interviews conducted, it was the parole panels determination to deny parole to Yolanda Saldivar and set her next parole review for March 2030. The reason provided by the panel for denial was the Nature of the Offense: The record indicates that the instant offense has elements of brutality, violence, assaultive behavior or conscious selection of victim’s vulnerability indicating a conscious disregard for the lives, safety, or property of others, such that the offender poses a continuing threat to public safety.",2025-03-27 23:23:05,100,DemiFiendRSA,music
mk42kx4,1jlgviz,reddit,"So...the wiki page on this situation is horrifying. Saldívar acted as Selena's manager for several businesses she ran. None of their employees liked her, nor did Selena's family. She basically acted like she owned everything, going over Selena's head to fire employees and controlling their finances. It was soon discovered that Saldívar had embezzled $30k from the businesses, and so Selena's dad fired her on the spot. However, she still had control of all of the financial documents. Selena tried to get them all back, but Saldívar dragged her feet the whole time to avoid giving them up. She even went as far as to *fake being raped* (yes I am fucking serious) to guilt trip Selena into dropping it. Eventually, Selena decided enough was enough and point blank demanded all the papers. And Saldívar responded by shooting Selena in the chest, calling her a ""bitch,"" and driving away in her truck.

I looked around and a bunch of my classmates were huddled in groups and bawling their eyes out.  I asked one of them what the fuck was going on and they said Selena had died.

I'm not gonna pretend I was her biggest fan (I was and still am a metal / alternative guy) but the effect her death had that night on everyone in my town was visceral.

mo942og,1k4ano8,reddit,"I think this trend is inevitable for a lot of things where someone is looking for ""good enough"". You see it in EVERYTHING from background animations, background images, to icons, to sprites for video games. You can just use AI and bypass both paying and having to deal with copyright issues. Human made is quickly becoming a premium luxury, like free range chicken and eggs, or organic fruit. 

I just don't see any escape. Everyone's incentives are just bad for human made stuff when AI will do. If you are a solo creator of some flavor, or even in a team with minimal exposure and money, AI is an irresistible and cheap shortcut. 

It won't be long before AI will be making the backing tracks for aspiring singers/rappers because it means they can create without hiring anyone. AI is going to make the images and sprites for indie game makers because it means drastically less time and money spent on art assets that normally would require going back and forth with an artist you need to pay. Writers will use it as an editor to get their first books out. Once AI video gets good, indie writers and director will use it for their actors because it means they can create without dealing with real human actors, sets, and all that jazz. Think of how many anime nerds are going to do their own anime by using AI because they can't draw but want to tell a story they normally would have no ability to make. 

The most hopeful interpretation is that this will enable individual creators to make things they normally couldn't because it that's skills that don't have; so the anime nerd that wants to tell a story but can't draw, or the writer that wants to do a movie but doesn't have the social and business skills to deal with a full production crew.

mo9kec6,1k4ano8,reddit,"I'm a keyboard player. Drummers, string players, woodwind players, and even some vocalists curse me. Why? Because, as a keyboard player, DAWs like Logic Pro or Digital Performer or Ableton Live are geared toward keyboard players and we have been replacing all of those instrumentalists in music for the last 10 years...*at least*...(drummers for even longer than that). 

People can spend $7K on a decent sample library recorded by the top engineers in the industry in an amazing studio and played by some of the top players in the industry. Now they are at your fingertips. You can score films, and it sounds like a live orchestra (it was live at some point along the way), you can do demos of your songs without so much as a text to your favorite drummer or bass player, or yes, even your favorite piano player (Logic's Session Players aren't exactly terrible).

I see AI as just the next logical step. 

But ultimately, you have to know what you're doing. Even the visual art world has seen AI become a force within it, but the person programming the AI has to know art very well to make the ultimate choices that get released.

I played in a pit once for the musical How the Grinch Stole Christmas. I was under headphones, as was the rest of the band. There were live horns, drums, bass, and another keyboard player. We all had personal mixers to decide what we wanted to hear at the volume we wanted to hear it.

On my keyboard was a little meter that ran from 1 to 10 that was triggered by my expression pedal with my left foot. In the music, there would be small numbers that would indicate how loud the music needed to be...what level on the meter it ought to be. My performance was supposed to be exactly the same every single night...no room for error or expression beyond what was written into the music.

Given that situation, you could argue that NONE of us were playing live music. We were nothing but living computers inputting our info, while the engineer at FOH only had to make sure the mix was acceptable. After that gig, I seriously didn't know why they used live musicians at all...we were basically playing tracks, with the only difference being we could possibly make a mistake....which was not tolerated.

AI just goes one step beyond that. Music has been digitized, quantized, tuned, compressed, mixed, etc, for a long time. It isn't what it used to be, and it will probably never return to the way it used to be since audiences now are used to hearing ""perfection.""

mo9u983,1k4ano8,reddit,"Yep. It's pissing me off. I found a few cool aesthetic channels, I think it was like ""The Luna Lounge"" or something, and it was supposed to be ""Space Jazz/Funk"" with art of Aliens sitting at a bar with big windows showing planets behind them etc. At first I didn't realize, but after listening a while, I noticed all of it sounded very similar and repetitive. Then I noticed the volume of content they were pumping out. Like 3 hour-long videos with ""unique songs"" every month for a couple of months. No artist names or credits given anywhere. The art also seemed like it was an AI prompt or something because it was also all very similar. No human is pumping out that kind of work at that volume and having custom art made (let alone doing it themselves) at that rate. 

No one in the comments was calling it out, so I think they were deleting comments. There was no disclosure. I felt cheated. I reported the channel as spam because YouTube doesn't have an option to report unflagged AI content, and blocked them and similar pop-up channels. 

Here are some examples of AI music channels that are pretty obvious.

Exhibit A: [Mugiwaves, a DnB/Synth-pop AI slop factory with AI art](https://www.youtube.com/@mugiwave) (some could be legitimate or used with permission, didn't scrub through every video to find out). 

Exhibit B: [The Luna Lounge, The Space/Funk/Jazz combo I described above](https://www.youtube.com/@Lunaloungelofi). It's a shame it isn't real because I enjoy the aesthetic, but I won't support AI replacing artists and consume AI over real art. 

Exhibit C: [Soul King Radio](https://www.youtube.com/@soulkingradio), an AI funk channel that is blatantly ripping off the name and aesthetic concept from the anime One Piece, where [a skeleton with an Afro named Brooke has a music career where he goes by the name ""Soul King""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MFcP6t7EYc).

moa4zpd,1k4ano8,reddit,"Absolutely agree with you. What you experienced highlights a real and growing issue—AI-generated music is flooding platforms like YouTube, often unlabeled or misleading, and it is having a noticeable impact on quality, creativity, and trust. Here’s the thing: AI music often lacks human intention, emotional nuance, and the imperfections that make real music powerful. It’s built on patterns scraped from existing work, which can result in passable “background” sound but rarely anything truly moving or meaningful. That “bland” feeling you picked up on? Totally valid. Studies have shown that while AI can mimic style, it struggles with innovation or genuine emotional expression—something human composers and musicians bring naturally from their lived experience.

The bigger problem is transparency. If you’re listening to music thinking it’s from a real artist and later find out it’s algorithmically generated with zero creative soul behind it, that’s a betrayal of trust. It dilutes the value of actual musicianship and clogs the ecosystem with content farms pumping out endless tracks that game the algorithm. And you’re not alone—there’s already backlash from artists and listeners alike about AI content being prioritized or mislabeled on platforms, hurting both creators and the people who want to discover authentic music.

You see it in EVERYTHING from background animations, background images, to icons, to sprites for video games. You can just use AI and bypass both paying and having to deal with copyright issues. Human made is quickly becoming a premium luxury, like free range chicken and eggs, or organic fruit. 

I just don't see any escape. Everyone's incentives are just bad for human made stuff when AI will do. If you are a solo creator of some flavor, or even in a team with minimal exposure and money, AI is an irresistible and cheap shortcut. 

It won't be long before AI will be making the backing tracks for aspiring singers/rappers because it means they can create without hiring anyone. AI is going to make the images and sprites for indie game makers because it means drastically less time and money spent on art assets that normally would require going back and forth with an artist you need to pay. Writers will use it as an editor to get their first books out. Once AI video gets good, indie writers and director will use it for their actors because it means they can create without dealing with real human actors, sets, and all that jazz. Think of how many anime nerds are going to do their own anime by using AI because they can't draw but want to tell a story they normally would have no ability to make. 

The most hopeful interpretation is that this will enable individual creators to make things they normally couldn't because it that's skills that don't have; so the anime nerd that wants to tell a story but can't draw, or the writer that wants to do a movie but doesn't have the social and business skills to deal with a full production crew.

My mom and dad are 85. My dad was always really athletic and ran marathons well into his 50s. My mom was never athletic, but was always thin and healthy.

Their decline was sudden, and sharp. Happily, they are still mentally in pretty good shape!

Wonder if mobility decline will happen to Mick soon. I hope not (I don't wish ill on anyone, except for a select few humans), but it's odd how our bodies fall apart. Some people have long, slow declines, others stay fit until a sharp breaking point.

mma0b6v,1jvcrs9,reddit,"The article was an interesting read, I never knew that bands outside of the US had to spend so much money just to be able to perform in the US. This is even worse when it's shown that it's easier for bands to perform in other countries that aren't the US. I agree that international bands performing in the US should be considered cultural exchange and that it should be cheaper and more efficient for them to be able to perform in the US. 

Also, it's not that surprising that international artists are choosing to not perform in the US due to our current international relations. When someone comes into the US, it's easy to tie them up with ""visa issues"" given how much red tape there is. Moreover, artists songs and personal opinions seem be playing a part in some artists losing their visas, like shown with Los Alegres Del Barranco's. Like, at what point is American market worth the amount of jumping through hoops only to be told, ""no"", detained for an uncertain amount of time, and then sent back home.

- Bands are messy...getting 3 or more people to agree and align...staying that way for an EXTENDED amount of time is hard in this day and age.

- Bands are chaotic - extension if the point above. Disagreements leading to legal battles and breakups

- Bands are FUN.  There is nothing like watching a band play together...LIVE...and in sync.  When a band's sound is tight, there's really nothing like it.  3 or more people connected creatively is a thing of beauty

- Youtube, TikTok...all these platforms are great...but they promote (more like encourage) individuals over bands.

moe0vsm,1k4yl9w,reddit,"Speaking anecdotally from my experience, but it’s HARD to get a bunch of people on the same page as you to really go and do it. Constant fights over scheduling sharing the one drummer who is good in your genre with 2 other bands, plus their side projects. It’s so expensive finding a practice space as an adult. Everyone has their own idea of what good music sounds like, and a show is expected to have more and more. So on one end, some venues have punk bands with a 2 guitarists, a bassist and drummer sounding minuscule, meanwhile I’ve been in plenty of bands that have whole midi triggered light shows and tracks and stuff when we show up to a basement show and the singer is absolutely insistent we load everything in the house to play the gig with the full show because it’s “part of the show” like I get it you don’t want to sound smaller, but the sound guy is working on an 8 track mixer and the speakers are also our monitors (we don’t need them the room is small). That’s not to mention that venues are closing across the nation because of ticket master.

So basically, it boils down to the difficulty of finding committed talented musicians, the egos of those who are committed and talented are very pronounced and causes conflict, it’s a pain in the ass to gig as a band (not to mention people are going to shows less in general) and that venues are closing down.

Much easier for the big record companies to manufacture singular artists of middling quality and put their PR behind them. They're easy to replace too. 

Artists with staying power and dedicated fans start demanding more money, or re-record their own albums to get the publishing rights. It's much more financially efficient to churn out artists that can get significant streams/radio play for a few years, then move on to the next one. 

Now, with AI, we can cut the cost of recording/producing, heck, even mixing, to a fraction of the previous cost, while maintaining more control over image/sound, and most importantly: percentages. 

The public doesn't seem to mind. And the way streaming services like Spotify is set up for royalties (basically, a pyramid), makes it so that controlling the playlists and generating plays, instead of *fandom*, is sufficient to earn ludicrous amounts of money, while foregoing the need for artists like your Bob Dylan's, Bruce Springsteens etc.",2025-04-22 07:30:38,3,UntowardHatter,music

I'm not complaining about it, I just think it's interesting. 

Back in the day when a full band was required to rock, the talent was an average of the members of that band, approximately, with the more talented taking the lead. 

Now with solo artists, some can be much farther from the average because there is only one (a single outlier in talent is unlikely, but having multiple outliers together is almost impossibly unlikely).

There is also the issue of, even if outliers with extreme talent do find each other, they could interfere with each other anyway due to type.

I believe this naturally leads to slightly less relatable, though more elevated art. It also goes the other way, but the bad stuff is mostly ignored or never gains popularity, along with some great stuff too",2025-04-22 13:39:08,1,JoeKingQueen,music

mksncgu,1joh8ty,reddit,"As a live music fan, purchasing tickets at a fair price can be a real buzzkill. The bots Bob refers to are automated software programs (computers) designed to interact with ticketing websites at high speeds. These bots swiftly bypass security measures, allowing resellers to stockpile tickets and sell them at inflated prices on secondary markets which sucks for us.

And then we have:

* Verified Resellers: Verified resellers are authorized by platforms to sell tickets, the prices they charge vary (and do) based on market demand.
* Individual Resellers (Scalpers): Work independently and typically resell tickets on a small scale.
* Ticket Brokerages: These are larger, licensed businesses that sell tickets legally but often at inflated prices, sometimes partnering with venues. (hmm?)

Anyone know how to get around this? (besides buying last minute)

I went to the Rolling Stones' *Hackney Diamonds* Tour in LA. A 24 oz Michelob Ultra was selling for $25, and concert shirts ranged from $40 to $60, with some not including the tour dates. I watched a lady next to me buy a letterman’s jacket for $700. WTF?

Fun fact about Bob, also known as Kid Rock: during his high school years, he was part of a breakdancing crew called the Furious Funkers and DJed at parties in exchange for free beer. His stage name was coined by a predominantly Black crowd in Detroit who enjoyed watching 'that white kid rock' the turntables. I guess many would say he's come a long way from his original roots. \~[Devil Without a Cause](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g0z4DVYeak) (1998)

When both Pearl Jam and Nirvana were active, you had people that preferred one or the other, but they were pretty much equally popular and successful. 
It was only after Cobain’s death that Nirvana was put on a pedestal like they’re on today and regarded as the band that changed music. It was several bands, and Pearl Jam was every bit as influential as Nirvana was at the time.",2025-04-04 15:06:23,15,Wildcard3369,music

Ten was just so much more musical than Bleach/Nevermind. 

Although it’s funny: looking back you can still hear vague influences from the 80’s in Ten. The way the drums are mixed, the guitar tones. Nirvana eschewed all of that shit. 

By the time VS came along, PJ had ditched the big reverbs and (most of) the stadium guitar tones.

To me, Vitology is where they had finally shaken off any vestiges of the rock era that preceded them. Yeah, they definitely had a huge hand in killing Hair Metal (thank god), but I also think they incorporated some elements of it and that contributed to how well Ten was received.",2025-04-04 16:35:20,4,Clovis_Winslow,music

""Plaintiff, one of the most successful recording artists of all time, lost a rap battle that he provoked and in which he willingly participated. Instead of accepting the loss like the unbothered rap artist he often claims to be, he has sued his own record label in a misguided attempt to salve his wounds.”

I don't think it's a good sign for Drake that his own label is calling him a bitchy sore loser...

mn60hry,1jzdwae,reddit,"I'm a lifelong country music fan. I guess now I should be called a classic country music fan. Country music has been absolutely awful the last 25 years. And I don't see any turning back. All of old Nashville died out, and it became like everything else. Make as much money as you can while pushing out watered-down talent that will do anything you tell them to do.

Fiddles, mandolins, and steel guitars are gone. Replace with synthesizers and a background beat. Much much more economical. Because those great Fiddlers mandolin players and lSteell Guitarists are quite expensive when you need to hire them for the studio, and then hire them to go on tour.

Honestly, it's a national tragedy. The country and western genre was part of Americana. From Roy Acuff, Kitty Wells, and Hank Sr... to Brooks & Dunn, Alan Jackson, Alabama, and George Strait. And then everything in between. It was amazing. And it still is amazing. But Nashville lost its way. And they no longer want a Merle Haggard, who spent time in prison and wrote all his own original material about it. They want Britney Spears with a Southern drawl. Or not. It appears that as long as you can fake it on your songs, I like Taylor Swift did, that that's good enough.

It makes me sick. So I agree with you. Not sure your age, but if you've listened in the last 25 years, then that's all you've ever heard. You're exactly right. Songs now are about ""look at my truck, look how big my tractor is, look how much I drink, I'm going to bang that chick!"" Every country song is just trying to convince you that their country. Whereas for the first 70 years, it was obvious that they were the real thing, so they sang about more complex subjects. It wasn't just about cheating, it was about why they did it and the sorrow they currently are living in.

25 Minutes to Go has lyrics written by Shel Silverstein, author of classic children's book The Giving Tree. 25 Minutes to Go is not a song for children, it's a man counting down the minutes until they execute him via hanging.

What did I just read? Erotic food comedy sounds like fun. 

Honestly I wonder why musicians couldn’t use OnlyFans just to sell live streaming solo performances. Or maybe they do?  The article  mentions some artists who release original recorded/video content to their OF first. 

YouTube is absolutely full of solo music performance videos where at least half the draw is the musician is a really good looking person (usually a woman), although some of them are also damn good musicians. Some seem to be pretty successful at drawing lots of views.

And a hardly original point that needs emphasis: the marketing of mainstream pop singers, again especially women, has overlapped softcore pornography (and more) for generations now.  Success in pop music has been dependent on looks forever. Doubly so for women.

Alas (from the aspiring pop star’s point of view) there is no scarcity of good looking people who can sing or play music well. But it’s the minimum barrier to entry for pop music success.",2025-04-06 11:56:50,2,MonsieurReynard,music

It’s my favorite of her songs so far. I’ve been saving the videos of her biggest shows that have been popping up on YouTube and I’ve watched them all. She’s an insanely talented performer, and she’s only going to improve. 

And there’s honestly no need to knock down any of the other pop girls to elevate her. There are videos of her warming up to Taylor Swift songs. Which makes sense, she probably grew up listening to her.

This is honestly my favorite version of “Pink Pony Club”. And trust me, I’ve heard *many*.

mlqg1mk,1jsyn8y,reddit,"I know nothing about apple music but I'll give my feedback on Spotify. Its algorithm is very stubborn. This is a positive, at least in one hand, because you can explore things in the program without worry that one listen of an album or artist will have the algorithm adding them to its dataset immediately thereafter. Spotify wants more user input before it commits that input to its dataset. So if there's something you know you want to start appearing in your algorithm it takes multiple user inputs and interactions before the algorithm will take the hint. I prefer having a robust, but steady music algorithm on hand for consistency.

Again, I know nothing about apple, but I can compare Spotify to YouTube as well. YouTube has a significantly more fickle algorithm. What listening to six albums on Spotify will do to your Spotify algorithm can be achieved on YouTube by watching two music videos. YouTube is much more likely to make recommendations based on a smaller dataset when compared to Spotify.

Apple Music - it's been the best overall. Not amazing at one thing but does everything fairly well.

Seeing these people write up their garbage, and share complete nothingburger articles in hopes of getting people to pull out their pitchforks is crazy.

What’s the reasoning?

Is it projection? What are they hiding? We all know how real projection is, one look at politics makes that abundantly clear.

Is it because he put out a statement about being a womaniser and sex addict and sought redemption? Tried to better himself?

Is THAT what put a target on his back for these people? The fact that he didn’t just ignore it?

Was it a case of feeding the Ibis? Pretty much nobody even acknowledges claims when people accuse them of anything in the public sphere.

But he did, he responded and fed the Ibis - is that why these people have latched onto him like this?

It’s wild to see and would be such an interesting thing to research.


Anyway, full steam ahead with the band - I can’t wait for the new album, would absolutely see them if they came to my country and whether this particular subsection of projectionists or whatever like it or not, the band and Jesse with it, are back.

Some pictures at dinner and a bus isn't all that damning. 

If my favorite artist sent me messages asking for dick pics you bet I'm saving that message for all time. 

This is hearsay, pure conjecture. Where was she the first round of allegations?  What about every tour before this one? It's been 8 years to say something, and again- every tour before that. 

Surely Jesse has done questionable things that he's not proud of, but to demand that he validate and corroborate your story as restitution is a win-win situation for her and a lose- lose for him; and that's why I'm calling BS on this allegation. She's risking nothing and wins regardless of his response. Even if some elements were true, it would be messy to agknowledge some of it and refute what isn't. He literally can't defend himself without it blowing up in his face. He could sue for libel for whatever is untrue, but we've all seen the shit show that leads to, and I don't think Jesse's the kind of guy that would fight back given how remorseful and ashamed he's been about his past behavior.",2025-04-09 03:59:30,1,avg_redditoman,music

Because she'd wasted so much time getting wasted before setting off, we were late, and we missed Mr Adams' set. She was both pissed and piss drunk but since she'd sprung for VIP seats we went in anyway and watched about 30 minutes of Oasis. She was miserable but I was pretty indifferent. On our way out I bought a bootleg Oasis shirt with a crooked graphic of the Gallagher boys to commemorate the occasion.

mnhrxro,1k0a2b5,reddit,"I was at this show at the RAH that got him fired and, in my opinion, Starkey was playing *extremely* well. That said, this particular show was not a good one for Pete and Roger.

Roger forgot the lyrics to one of the verses to ""I Can See for Miles"", although to his credit, he was excellent in regards to his singing, and even nailed the ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" scream. His voice doesn't even sound old, which shows just how much he still practices. At the start of the show he also had to ask the sound desk to turn up his monitor because he could not hear himself, which must have been frustrating.

Sadly, Pete was in dire shape; he blamed it on some knee surgery he had some time before the show. He just wasn't playing like himself at all, and he seemed shy and uncomfortable. There was basically no lead playing to speak of, and the rhythm playing was barely there. I hope it really is the knee issues and that Pete gets better soon, but I fear that Pete might have officially gotten old. Thankfully, Simon their rhythm guitarist and Pete's younger brother was absolutely dead-on and on-point from start to finish.

This particular show had some fuckups on Roger and Pete's behalf, and I suspect they are taking it out on him. I also suspect he will be back with the band soon enough.",2025-04-16 23:06:14,1,PrinceKajuku,music

mk8f9xh,1jl5erb,reddit,"There is no dispute that, at age 34, Michael Jackson slept more than 30 nights in a row in the same bed with 13-year-old Jordie Chandler at the boy’s house with Chandler’s mother present. He also slept in the same bed with Jordie Chandler at Chandler’s father’s house. The parents were divorced. So far, five boys Michael Jackson shared beds with have accused him of abuse: Jordie Chandler, Jason Francia, Gavin Arvizo, Wade Robson, and Jimmy Safechuck. Jackson had the same nickname for Chandler and Arvizo: “Rubba.” He called Robson “Little One” and Safechuck “Applehead.” Jackson paid $25 million to settle the Chandlers’ lawsuit, with $18 million going to Jordie, $2.5 million to each of the parents, and the rest to lawyers. Jackson said he paid that sum to avoid something “long and drawn out.” Francia also received $2.4 million from Jackson. Michael Jackson suffered from the skin discoloration disease vitiligo. Jordie Chandler drew a picture of the markings on the underside of Jackson’s penis. His drawings were sealed in an envelope. A few months later, investigators photographed Jackson’s genitalia. The photographs matched Chandler’s drawings. The hallway leading to Jackson’s bedroom was a serious security zone covered by video and wired for sound so that the steps of anyone approaching would make ding-dong sounds. Jackson had an extensive collection of adult erotic material he kept in a suitcase next to his bed, including S&M bondage photos and a study of naked boys. Forensic experts with experience in the Secret Service found the fingerprints of boys alongside Jackson’s on the same pages. Jackson also had bondage sculptures of women with ball gags in their mouths on his desk, in full view of the boys who slept there. According to the Neverland staff interviewed by the Santa Barbara authorities, no one ever saw or knew of a woman spending the night with Michael Jackson, including his two spouses, Debbie Rowe or Lisa Marie Presley. Rowe, the mother of two of Jackson’s children, made it clear to the Santa Barbara authorities that she never had sex with Jackson. The parents of boys Jackson shared beds with were courted assiduously and given myriad expensive gifts. Wade Robson’s mother testified in the 2005 trial that she funneled wages through Jackson’s company and was given a permanent resident visa. Jimmy Safechuck’s parents got a house. Jordie Chandler’s mother got a diamond bracelet. Two of the fathers of those who have accused Jackson, Jordie Chandler and Wade Robson, committed suicide. Both were estranged from their sons at the time. In a 2002 documentary, Living with Michael Jackson, Jackson told Martin Bashir there was nothing wrong with sharing his bed with boys.",2025-03-28 19:06:45,3,erotic_jesus,music

mk0yzo6,1jl5erb,reddit,"I am fully in the camp that MJ was a creepy dude with mental issues who thought he was a kid and wanted to be friends with and impress kids, but didn't molest kids. His celebrity enabled this lifestyle and made the media controversy sensation super easy, and the media went full on with the smears because it was a ratings bonanza. 

There's been plenty of work documenting how the actual court cases heavily diverged from what was presented in the media about him, such as an investigation by a multiple award winning journalist titled ""[One of the Most Shameful Episodes In Journalistic History](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/charles-thomson/one-of-the-most-shameful_b_610258.html)"", which pointed out how the media reported the accusations, but completely failed to cover how said accusations were debunked in court. It's also been covered on Reddit pretty well, and not in some conspiracy subs. For example.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/9a7i20/comment/e4tacgn/](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/9a7i20/comment/e4tacgn/)

It's too bad that in 2025, the media's sensationalized take has won, over the court & FBI findings, and people continue to invent whole new untruths about his supposed actions which were never even claimed back in the 90's/00's.

mk1na2c,1jl5erb,reddit,"Interesting fact for you all- The Arvizo family didn’t rush to the police when Gavin made these claims... they went to a lawyer. The same lawyer who got the 20 million settlement for the Chandlers from Michael in the 90s... if my child had been molested, two things- I’m either going to the police, or picking up a baseball bat and taking it to the perpetrators head. I’m not looking for their money and I’m sure as hell not publicising it so my child is going to be known as the MJ abuse victim for the rest of his life and have to get a new identity.
The maid who’s now making claims against him admits to going through his trash and selling his items and owing the Jackson estate over 1 million dollars, and never saw anything directly paedophilic. 

The new ‘documentary’ with Wade basically has someone who tried to shop a book deal for their abuse story and demanded 1 BILLION dollars from the MJ estate to keep quiet, which Wade admits to... on top of this he was turned down to manage the huge MJ cirque so lei show and attacked the Jackson estate for this decisions in prior years. Oh and he was also at Jackson’s defence in 2005 to testify against the accusers- let me ask you all a question- if you were a child molester and you had abused a child, would you get that individual to profess your innocence in court? Probably not. Might be suicide... just like signing a book of naked photos of boys and giving it to a child? The richest man in the world, a pretty smart businessman, let’s be honest- wouldn’t sign his own death warrant like that.
MJ had over 30 children come to his defence in the trial including Brett Barnes who said he’d shared a bed with Michael over 300 times and nothing ever happened and that when he dies his conscience will be clean because money isn’t what matters.

Whilst on the subject, what about Ryan White- the poor boy with HIV who the public treated like a Lepper and MJ took under his wing? Everyone was scared of contracting HIV, not Michael, he just cared for him and his family- I don’t think a pedophile would go for a boy dying of AIDS,  might be a risk to their own health!? You know, if they were looking to be sexual with them.... Instead he encouraged him to keep fighting his illness, paid for his medical treatments, would come and spend time with the family, brought Ryan his dream car- a Mustang... and when Ryan was close to death Michael insisted on flying there to see him before the end but he didn’t make it in time, he got there just hours after from the other side of the world and the boys mum said Michael just went to Ryan’s room and he just looked at his things and sat there silently and cried.
What about Farkus too, the boy MJ instructed his own medical team to find a liver for? He saved his life and they spent a lot of time together, as a grown man he says that nothing but innocence ever occurred with Michael.

I’m tired of people trying to take down and accuse an innocent human who was a hundred times more advanced than most beings on this Earth. There’s holes in every single accusation to the hilt.",2025-03-27 17:27:20,3,AllyKiss18,music

1. Prior to the 1980s, Radio DJs had a lot more control over what they could play, so they could direct the cultural conversation by popularizing the music that spoke to the counterculture. Once the radio got deregulated in the mid-90s, it got bought up by moguls who have no vested interested in left-wing protest music. They apparently have a LOT of vested interested in Nickleback though.

2. No amount of protest rock ultimately prevented where we're at now. As awesome as the counter-culture bands of the 60s, punks of the 70s, and DIY alt rockers of the 80s and 90s were, none of that stuff stopped us from getting here.

Think about it for a moment. Take ten random people, stick them in a room and play them protest songs about one specific issue or another. Then ask them if hearing that song inspired them to go out and change anything.

I guarantee 8 of the 10 will say ""no.""

Nowadays it's hard to find a band out there that doesn't have some form of synthetic sounds and vocals in their track.

Musicians and singers still exist. They just have an opportunity to access tools to enable creativity, expedite the production process, eliminate the need for certain professions and open up opportunities to reach more people quickly.

I have no doubt AI will shake up the industry and music production, but I doubt we'll end up with more than a handful of popular ""pure AI-only"" artists. I'd be blind and out of touch to say there will be none, but I am certain we will find ourselves in a situation where one or two band members might not exist, maybe a guitarist and a drummer have an AI singer, maybe a pop artist has a band that doesn't exist. Maybe certain layers in your mix are no longer simply a synthetic instrument, but a completely natural sounding artificially generated stem or sample.

Its a rough and uncertain future out there right now, but I am hopeful and positive we'll find a healthy way to integrate this new technology eventually once its better understood and its development slows.",2025-04-20 17:13:18,-10,MrVandalous,music

He plays it much straighter now than he did when he joined in the 90s. But he plays professional and clean, keeps good time to the click track that holds the score together and sounds fluid.

Armchair diagnosis is that Daltrey is losing his hearing more seriously than before and for years he blamed stage volume. Now they turned that down for in ear monitors and electric drums to tour with an orchestra. And then he blamed the monitor mix. His solo shows have the same thing, he's mad at the monitor mixer.

Obviously the Britney stuff also helped.

mlm8993,1jsepab,reddit,"Songs. I think in music across the board from music fans to musicians to critics, there’s a lack of capacity to see the forest for the trees when it comes to what the average person resonates with about music. JC is obviously an amazing singer. Likely the most gifted singer in N*Sync. And I hate N*Sync, but just being real, the dude can sing. But nothing, be it singing ability, vocal tone, personality, physical appearance, or industry clout can defeat the audience’s love of songs. 

I’m a musician myself and I can get really in the weeds about instrumentalists or performers and their abilities. There are absolutely amazing performers who have never once made a song I like. The degree of music theory available to the average free jazz player is astounding and in terms of raw ability probably outshines any of the most popular artists on earth. But the vast majority of us have less than no interest in listening to that. Why?

Songs. All back to songs. Michael Jackson was a great singer. Was he El Debarge good? Not by light years. But El Debarge never wrote “Billie Jean.” El Debarge never recorded a “Don’t Stop Til You Get Enough.” If given the option between the two, just hearing a couple songs of theirs, I think the average person would probably say MJ was the greater singer simply because they enjoy those songs better.

And that’s the reality with Timberlake is the dude is a very good singer. Excellent singer. Chasez is an extraordinary singer. But Justin had Pharrel and Timbaland at the top of their game and importantly Justin’s ideas were just really good. Really engaging anyway. Whether or not you liked Justin’s records, you probably felt something about “Cry Me a River.” You probably had an opinion about “SexyBack.” Strong opinions don’t really tend to come from stuff that’s just bad. They come from stuff that resonates. JC’s songs just couldn’t manage to resonate. 

I should say too that hype matters too. But you just can’t succeed on hype alone. I’m literally struggling to remember the artists who’ve come and gone who received huge pushes from their labels and had all the opportunity in the world but just had no song and/or no vibe. I think the concept of “Industry plant,” is an erroneous one because at the end of the day people have to like a thing for it to succeed. But nonetheless, once a thing is likable it will undoubtedly succeed more with greater promotion. Smashmouth wrote “All Star,” for the now obscure and forgotten flop Mystery Men (which I loved). The song was released, had its minor blip, and then disappeared until it was put on the soundtrack to the smash hit Shrek. So clearly more exposure can absolutely help a track and an artist, but the song has to be worth a damn to begin with. 

It also helps that Timberlake while not necessarily a great actor (I don’t mind him but I know a lot of people really dislike his acting) is at least a competent one, so he was able to take his great songs with him while he participated in successful sketches on SNL. He was able to get billing in that dud Mike Meyers movie which even if the movie failed and even if you didn’t like Timberlake in it, it helped solidify him as somebody who’s good songs could get on your radar. 

Anyway, that’s it. I think it’s songs. People prefer Bob Dylan to the easily more capable singer Phil Ochs and I think that’s exclusively because of the broader appeal of Dylan’s songs (I personally prefer Ochs any day but I get that he’s more niche). Same thing",2025-04-05 23:25:00,42,Strict-Farmer904,music
mlm7csw,1jsepab,reddit,"Prior to Timberlake's solo album,  Timberlake was already actively writing songs for other artists as well as N'Sync. The single ""Gone"" was actually written by Timberlake himself for Michael Jackson but he turned it down and it was recorded by N'Sync instead. Originally the song was meant to have multiple versions with the other members but only Timberlake's version was what they went with for the single. 
Allegedly Michael Jackson contacted Justin after that single dropped and encouraged him to go solo. They eventually worked together quite a bit. A lot of songs on Justified were also intended for Jackson.

I think Justin's talent as a songwriter is what gave him the edge over JC Chasez. While JC did also write a few songs for N'Sync, fewer were as popular as Justin's. Additionally, as Timberlake wrote a TON of songs himself, it opened doors with other musicians to help advance his solo career.

Also the whole Britney Spears thing. Gone and Cry Me a River were both written about her by him.

ml7aaqb,1jqiywa,reddit,"I really love this phase of his life where he’s looking back on his life/career after he’s done so much. The music, the documentary, his 20 hour 2016 audiobook that he reads himself. He spent seven years writing the book ‘Born to run.’ I suspect this is part of that process. I really can’t recommend his book enough, it is so thoughtful and introspective and you can tell that years of therapy have helped him understand what makes him tick. 

His need to create was the thing that really drove him, it was just tunnel vision. My favorite part is when he writes about the Super Bowl halftime show. I’m sure Patty’s cancer must be incredibly difficult too. He really doesn’t know what to do with himself if he’s not on stage and he readily admits that. It will be interesting to hear this music. He is not called the Boss because he’s a great musician, he’s known as the Boss because he makes every decision about the band. He mentioned that this is the opposite of how U2 work. It became an issue when he was nominated for the rock ‘n’ roll Hall of Fame as Bruce Springsteen, not as Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. They felt slighted, but at the end of the day, it was only his name on those contracts and he didn’t think it should be him and the band.",2025-04-03 14:04:53,29,Webgardener,music

Touring with Devin Townsend was off to a hilarious start when we received a notice from his tour manager of bus and tour rules. If food is present backstage, Mr Townsend must be allowed to finish eating before anyone else can approach the table. If you are seated and Mr Townsend enters the room you must offer your seat to him. If Mr Townsend asks for water or a towel and you are in possession of either you will immediately relinquish that towel or water.

Queensryche were a horrible band to open for. I had always loved them but they went out of their way to sabotage our set. Wouldn't let us set up our instruments on stage, but then wouldn't let us set them up backstage either and carry them up because we'd be making too much noise near their dressing room (we hadn't started yet). We didn't get to soundcheck because Queensryche didn't want any noise while they were preparing for their set. So...

Shamus and Cesaro are the nicest fucking guys. 

Cesaro is just the most down to earth dude.  Shamus asked us to look at his audition tape for The Walking Dead. He was going on and get my feedback. 

STING is super nice and very religious. Prays before each meal. It was like hanging out with your friends dad but then random people come up to him and are like ""Are you STINGER?"" 

WWE superstars have to buy all their own wardrobe shit so we're walking through a mall in Texas talking business and STINGER stops in front of a womans clothing store.

I tell him that I love his band and again..deadpan response. ""Thanks.""  Later on, I see his drummer a little ways away from the table and he actually talked to me for awhile.  Nice guy.

Years later, I'd meet Jared Leto while drum teching for a local band who was lucky enough to open for Jared's band 30 Seconds To Mars. This is during the touring of their first album, mind you.  After the show, Jared was very nice and even shook all of our hands before he and his band headed back to the tour bus.  I dunno if he's STILL this nice.

Bottom line, pretty much ALL the members of hardcore/metalcore bands I've met have been chill.  Keith Buckley (ex. Every Time I Die), all the dudes from Dillinger Escape Plan, the guys from Circa Survive, Between The Buried and Me, all the guys from Converge were really cool....hell, one time Schuylar from He Is Legend let us roll into a show with his crew because it was sold out.

I get it, but this 30 minute video he put out a few years ago practicing Dead tunes gave me a different appreciation of him. He seems genuinely humble but also demonstrates his virtuosity w/ the guitar.  (Skip to the 1:50 or so to start)

mmwvtg4,1jy6phm,reddit,"John Mayer is my favorite musician. I have to come to the defense of him when people say that he hasn’t brought anything new to guitar despite being a great player. That’s categorically wrong. In fact, part of what makes his continuum/ battle studies era brilliant is that he took the styles of Hendrix, Clapton, and Stevie (amongst others like BB) and seamlessly infused pop into it without losing the guitarist flair. That’s counts for something imo.

Furthermore I think when it comes to guitar playing, innovation kind of peaked around the late 80s/esrly 90s. I don’t really know many modern electric guitarists who have truly redefined the instrument when it comes to rock and blues. Furthermore, the entire story of rock and blues is taking what came before you. So even if you disagree with my pop point, I don’t think the “hasn’t brought anything new to the genre” take holds much weight. 

In addition to his ability to infuse rock, blues, and pop, I don’t think people really understand how great his phrasing is on the guitar. A good example of this is his cover of Going Down the Road feeling bad on letterman. Obviously it’s a dead (originally cotten) cover but you can’t tell me that his phrasing on the intro, verse, and solos of that cover aren’t borderline virtuoso level. He really is top of the class and anyone who says otherwise is just plain wrong imo.

A lot of old heads still don’t give him the credit he deserves on dead and company because he “has no emotion” or “it’s not Jerry”. Look, Jerry Garcia is great, even underrated in my opinion, but Jerry is nowhere near as tight in his phrasing, nor intentional as John. Not to say Jerry CANT be tight or intentional, but John just has more licks and knowledge in his arsenal and he can use them at will.

This clued me in to the fact that some songs might be fairly easy for a beginner to learn. I think many teachers neglect this fact, because when I was learning piano, my teacher would not allow me to spend piano time working on a song I liked.

I grew up, moved into poverty, abandoned my television for the radio since it was cheaper, and heard JM on the radio. After seeing his behavior and learning about his ego, the most ill will I could muster about such a talented human being was mourning the pop crap he plays when his blues and D&Co are killer.

* Speaking with [*TIME* in a cover story](https://time.com/7277722/ed-sheeran-interview-time100-2025/) for its TIME100 List on Wednesday, April 16, Ed Sheeran reflected on the years-long saga — prompted by his song's similarities to the 1973 Marvin Gaye classic ""Let's Get It On"" — and the ways in which it affected him.
* For a while, Sheeran, 34, felt like other songwriters were treating him like a “piggy bank, where people can just shake it,” he said. Once they legal proceedings were over, “everyone's left me the f--- alone — and the freedom really just lifted a weight.”
* In November 2024, Sheeran persuaded the court to uphold their decision in a copyright appeal case, arguing that he did not infringe the copyright of Gaye‘s sensual hit. Per [*Billboard*](https://www.billboard.com/pro/ed-sheeran-beats-lets-get-it-on-copyright-case-appeals-court/), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said that the pair of songs share only “fundamental musical building blocks” that cannot be owned by any individual songwriter.",2025-04-17 15:52:09,90,peoplemagazine,music

Hip Hop Marmalade spic and span
Met you one summer and it all began
You're the best girl that I ever did see
The great Larry Bird Jersey 33

Billy Shakespeare wrote a whole bunch of sonnets
Call me Willy Whistle 'cause I can't speak, baby
Somethin' in your eyes went and drove me crazy

Now I can't forget you and it makes me mad
Left one day and never came back
Stayed all summer then went back home
Macaulay Culkin wasn't Home Alone

Fell deep in love, but now we ain't speakin'

He had only just begun

He was God's chosen one

Jesse Lacey is not the same person he was when he was 20
Brand New is better 7 years later
Jesse, like everyone is redeemable 
You are not God, judge, jury or executioner.
If you don't like it, cool. But, no one cares about your opinion, or what you find irredeemable.
So stay away from Brand New. And the shows, and the music. 
Leave it for those of us who understand what it means to be good, forgiving people, and that no one is greater that everyone else. We are all just fleshy sin sacks.

It really does hurt when you love and support them, but now it matters what they do after. What’s the story on Jesse? He’s not a right wing grifter who turned to radical Catholicism, right? 

It all seems morally complex to me and that’s unfortunately just going to become more apparent about yourself and others as you age. I wouldn’t be upset at anyone that didn’t want to attend or that does. People saying you support pedophilia if you go and the whole concert needs to be burned down so seem like that’s where the negative energy is coming from that I don’t agree with.

It's very possible that Jesse may have changed, but we all have to remember that abusers have no incentive to admit to not changing. None of us know him. The people he victimized were victimized as a result of him abusing his power over them and the social dynamics at play. To me, allowing the band to regain their platform is accepting that you are ok with Jesse potentially offending again.

mjwxmz3,1jkokme,reddit,">The Oscar-nominated actor, 50, has taken his fandom for the rock band to new heights in recent years, touring some of their biggest albums in full with Jason Narducy and even singing the band’s 1985 single “Driver 8” on The Tonight Show in January.



>In a new interview with The Bitter Southerner, Shannon opened up about his love for R.E.M. and performing their songs — even if he’s not a fan of actors moonlighting as musicians.



>“I kind of walked away from \[songwriting\]. Because, if nothing else, it just seems kind of greedy,” said Shannon, who previously fronted the indie rock trio Corporal. “It’s like, how much good fortune can one person expect to have in their life? I’m not a fan of actors having rock and roll bands.”



>Still, he described his performances of R.E.M.’s music as “glorified karaoke.” 



>“Karaoke is, you know, on the one hand kind of an embarrassing ridiculous thing. But on the other hand, it’s an extraordinarily beautiful, moving thing that allows anybody, literally anybody, to go up on stage and sing a song that they love and sing it with as much passion or however the hell they want to sing it,” he explained.",2025-03-26 22:26:42,146,cmaia1503,music

But then, album after album they slowly started turning into queen and their albums were just new editions of ""i want to break free"" in different tones and lyrics. I am proud of them for touching sensitive subjects in their lyrics, they further the european tradition of trying to improve the world through music, but they need to find themselves because people used to look at Muse and found innovation, melody and technique and they traded that for the cozy sort of pop sound. 

Look at Polyphia and you will find out sort  of where i expected Muse to go. Look at U2 and find out sort of what they're actually turning into.

I remembered when I was in high school- I snuck out of the house one night to see Elton perform live in Detroit! It was an unforgettable performance that helped me understand the transformative power of music.

>Seeing him perform when I was in high school changed the course of my life. I had always felt like an outsider growing up and watching him on stage helped me to understand that it was OK to be different-to stand out- to take the road, less traveled by. In fact, it was essential.
>Over the decades it hurt me to know that someone I admired so much shared his dislike of me publicly as an artist. I didn’t understand it. I was told Elton John was the musical guest on SNL and I decided to go.

>I needed to go backstage and confront him . When I met him, the first thing out of his mouth was, “Forgive Me” and the wall between us fell down.

>Forgiveness is a powerful tool. Within minutes. We were hugging.

mmkxfd8,1jwst8t,reddit,"> There was no alcohol in the studio at any time because we didn’t want to put pressure on Warren. So believe it or not, we were sober when we did that. We drank around him once because I was reading a detective novel set in Miami and the characters went to a place called Harry’s Stone Crab Legs. I was talking to Warren and said, “I don’t even know what a stone-crab leg is. I want to get some stone-crab legs.” He goes, “I know this place out in the Valley.” So we went up to the Valley, and three of us R.E.M.-ers had a couple of drinks. Nothing untoward — we all kept an eye on Warren.

> Warren was driving, and honestly, I shouldn’t have had the drinks. There was a belly dancer there too.

The lead singer has a biography out that I think I read only covers the first thirty years of his life and he’s working on a follow up of the remaining years.  Is he that interesting? He also released a box set.  I have no idea what’s on it but it was like 10-12 years ago I guess.  Does Sully need a box set?

>Godsmack didn't come to an end, it's just a new chapter for them, and it's certainly a new chapter for Tony and I. We're already making new music and everybody's happy.

In other words, in the other body cam videos that they are NOT willing to show to the public, it is clear she did NOT fire the weapon or deliberately point it at uniformed officers. That is why she is STILL ALIVE.  Otherwise we would all have seen that video.   
  
As far as not ""following commands"". Try playing a game of Simon Says with a total stranger yelling at you after taking a round in the shoulder and losing 20 ounces of blood. She almost bled to death, by the way. 

If the woman had deliberately pointed a gun at uniformed police officers in the middle of a chase, she would have been filled with at least a dozen rounds. They are trained to shoot center mass and stop the target, not to graze or injure. That training is for the safety of the public and the officers. This was an officer accidentally catching a pedestrian in crossfire then noticing she was carrying a gun and thinking, ""Alright, we can accuse her attempted murder and maybe I won't get fired!""

ml2k35i,1jpujmy,reddit,"Live versions of Gravity and Slow Dancing in Burning Room (from the Where the Light Is album) by John Mayer have been forever favourites of mine. 

And this example is a little less of an architectured solo that Comfortably Numb or Hotel California would be (though he's done good covers of both) but something about the guitarist of the Main Squeeze (Max Newman) reminds me of why I started learning the guitar as a kid. It's a bit more raw than those songs, but something about the way he absolutely flys when the band really lets him loose just hits me like 1000 volts straight up the spine. I can't fully describe it, sometimes I use words like ""panache, or plays with fire"" but ultimately he just encapsulates, for ME, the magic of what an electric guitar can do that nothing else can. The phrasing and technique is quite good too but there's just this special sauce in the energy of it for me. 

Their cover of Have a Cigar: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R6StQfLNbw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R6StQfLNbw)  
Here's one of War Pigs:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSo76JiQrW8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSo76JiQrW8)

His take on Comfortably Numb is pretty great too, so long as you don't consider it sacrilege to change the original with a fair bit of homage to it. (Not that it's better that the OG, I just think it's also good)

Because I have ripped my CDs in a variety of formats over the last 20 years from 64k WMA files to FLAC with a few other formats and qualities in between such as OGG Vorbis. I have also used various qualities of audio equipment from cheap Philips earphones to my current setup which is not studio quality, though I have experienced studio masters on studio equipment in a recording studio. 

One thing in common with pretty much all of these is that the difference is really only noticeable after I have become familiar with the higher quality equipment or source and i've had to go back a step. I used to consider my TV speakers as fines, i'd watch films and TV programs on it just fine. A couple of years ago i bought an amplifier and connected some bookshelf speakers I had laying around to it. Going back to using the TV speakers they sound tinny, thin and generally pretty awful and my speakers are Sony SS-H1500 speakers, they are now something from someone like B&W and the amplifier is a Douk Audio M100, it is not exactly audiophile quality.

During lockdown I sorted out my ripped files by deleting them and re-ripping all my CDs to FLAC and making sure they were tagged consistently. I have a coupe of MP3 sample albums from Napalm Records, I also have a few of the tracks on CD, I know which one is which when I am listening on shuffle as I know how each one sounds. The ""core"" of the music is largely the same, it's in the fringes where it's different, they have less depth and clarity around the edges.  
  
 It's had to explain but it's the same as going from blu-ray back to DVD or DVD back to VHS. We were happy with VHS, it was what we watched but many people used to DVD or Blu-ray quality would really notice the flaws. 

I am no snob though, my amplifier is a Pioneer and my hi-fi speakers are by Sony, neither were low end options at the time they were made and the amplifier alone, adjusted for inflation, would be £1000-£1200 these days and the speakers about £300-£400, I paid about £40 for the amp and about £45 for the speakers. I am very comfortable with the sound and I have heard better but, as stated, that was a studio master in a studio, if that's 100 though my setup is a 75 (1 being a 64 k WMA file on cheap earphones) .",2025-04-23 09:15:39,-7,Martipar,music

If there was a union demanding that artists get paid more, have health insurance, have time off instead of touring relentlessly to pay the label back, etc than labels would have to meet a minimum standard for the artist. 

Unless things change, in many respects, the industry will remain the wild, wild west. Those who have the power will continue to have that power unless they are forced to relinquish it to meet a set standard.

ml588ep,1jq5iiw,reddit,"Former major label artist here. 

The advantages of being able to take out that loan and get into that environment are many. In our case, we got to make our albums to a pretty high standard, work with good people in expensive facilities. 

This is not just a luxury like the food there is better. To really have the budget to not cheap out and rush through everything was a great advantage compared to indie label budgets. We made those albums sound like we wanted and did not get interference. If we were having a moment of success in some part of the country we could go do gigs there. We got booked on some good tours through that association. 

We got dropped after the second album and it was a bummer to realize they weren't going to promote what I thought was our best work. But when we left, we could have signed to another label if we had the gumption to stick it out.

Doing everything yourself, as I do now, is another thing entirely. I don't get to hire great designers, I do flyers in PowerPoint cuz it's loaded on my work computer. Our latest release, we produced a whopping 100 copies. But, we've nearly sold them out and the future looks.... Doable. I miss the PR staff I could call and harangue for not doing enough to make us famous. But we carry on. 

I think you could look at a lot of bands and say the industry did them dirty, way worse than what happened to us. You could also look at Metallica, Nirvana, GNR and see examples where the bands really became who they were with a little bit of funding and development, and got some rewards in the end. Listen to Bleach and ponder... What if that band was stuck with those production standards for their whole career? They might not have been able to get Dave Grohl to fly out from DC to audition if they were gonna be on Sub Pop their whole lives, couldn't have afforded it. 

I'm an unlikely apologist for big labels, that was a four year blip in a near forty year career and it was surreal to live through. But what I'm saying is, it was both blessing and curse. Just like the indie labels I work with. A mixed bag of opportunity and limitations. Maybe the fact we never made a lot of money meant we got off easy.

ml4t12d,1jq5iiw,reddit,"It’s exploitative, but it’s not a scam. The labels tend to be greedy and take more than what seems fair, though.

In the vinyl era through the CD era, you couldn’t become a famous recording artist without signing with a label. Without a label, you wouldn’t have gotten on the radio, you wouldn’t have gotten into the record stores, and you wouldn’t have a career selling out stadiums. The idea is that the band makes money playing live, and the label gets almost all the rest of the money.

Nowadays it’s possible to build a following on YouTube and streaming services, but you’d also have to create your own music videos and record and produce everything yourself.

As for why successful band members run out of money, that’s easy. A lot of them are bad with money, and/or they treat their band’s income as if it’s a steady job that they will have until their 70s or 80s. A lot of bands that start off very successfully end up only having 1 - 3 good albums and fall off. Those with more financial savvy invest their money and live modestly in the early years so that they’ll be financially secure no matter what, but many prefer to buy expensive cars, jewelry, fly in private jets, etc. If their success slows down or stops, they wind up with no savings and they’re broke.",2025-04-03 02:06:07,18,TheLegendTwoSeven,music

We’ve been falsely led to believe that you’ve “made it” the moment you signed the contract with a major label, but it turns out you’re only at the very bottom of the totem.

He’s been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor.

In ‘87, Huey released this, Fore, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is “Hip to Be Square,” a song so catchy, most people probably don’t listen to the lyrics.

Screaming trees blew everybody away. Soul asylum shocked everybody as to how good the ""runaway train"" band was... When they were done it was as if the whole crowd was asking how the spin doctors was going to top that. 

Two songs after the spin Doctor started, half the crowd had left and you could see them exiting on the bridge towards land...

Chris, the lead singer, was obviously tripping his ass off. He was horrible.

* Five years after revealing her [harrowing abduction experience](https://people.com/music/duffy-rape-stripped-me-of-my-human-rights-kidnapping/), the Grammy-winning singer has [popped up on TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@emotion.hq/video/7485816448837897494) to help promote an upcoming remix of her hit song “Mercy.”
* In what appears to be her first public appearance in 10 years, Duffy, 40, lip-syncs along to a line from her 2008 breakthrough single before winking at the camera as the beat, remixed by e.motion, kicks in.
* The singer released her debut album *Rockferry* in 2008, and won the Grammy Award for best pop vocal album. Her second album, *Endlessly*, came in out 2010, though she left the public eye shortly after. In February 2020, Duffy revealed the reason for her lengthy absence from the spotlight: [a devastating ordeal](https://people.com/music/singer-duffy-raped-drugged-held-captive-days/) some years earlier in which she was raped, drugged and held captive.",2025-03-28 15:34:06,66,peoplemagazine,music

A few years ago i lost my dad to a sudden, very tragic accident. His coffin arrived to the sound of *Black bird* and he was lowered into the crematorium with *In my Life* playing. I now find it incredibly difficult to listen to those songs, and many others. But i remember listening to Yellow Submarine not long after he died, and for some reason *Pepperland* had a really profound effect on me. The nostalgia of being a child, the happy memories, the simple beauty of the song, the grief and the sadness- i couldnt help but bawl my eyes out.

It was in a foreign hotel's bathtub I baptized myself in change.

And one by one I drowned all of the people I had been.

I emerged to find the parallels were fewer. I was cleansed. I looked in the mirror

and someone new was there. Still, I was as helpless as a chess piece

when I was lifted up by someone's hand and delivered from the corner my enemies had got me in.

But in all of my salvation I still felt imprisoned inside that holding cell that is myself.

So I wait for the day when I'll hear the key as it turns in the lock

and the guard will say to me, ""Oh my patient prisoner you have waited for this day

and finally you are free! You are free! You are freezing.""

Now I'm staring at the sun, waiting for it to explode. Because a day is gonna come,

don't know when but it will come and then we will finally know the way out of here.

And I will throw away this wrinkled map and my chart of stars and compass, cracked.

And I'll climb out that tree all wet with sap to avoid the hungry beasts below.

I'll cut out my lover's tongue and sing of a graveyard gray and a garden green

and we won't have to worry no more. No we won't have to wonder again about

mkkhprs,1jn0vhw,reddit,"!?!?! There are better *Metallica* albums form that era, not to mention the hundreds of better albums (not more popular) from other bands, several with multiple better albums.

Music is subjective, and Master of Puppets is an *excellent* album and deservedly popular. . . . but on a desert island I'd get bored of it fairly quickly, and I think that there are more creative and interesting (as well as skilled, although that's not at the top of my criteria list) albums and bands from that era, such as:

Maiden's *Powerslave* (to mention only one)  
Priest's *Painkiller*  
Running Wild's *Blazon Stone* (and *Pile of Skulls*, and *Death or Glory*, etc., etc., p.s. best consistent message of any metal band, period, imo)  
Savatage's *Gutter Ballet* (and *Hall of the Mountain King*, and more. . . )  
Pagan Altar's *The Mythical & Magical*, or *Judgement of the Dead*  
Manowar's *Battle Hymns, Kings of Metal and Triumph of Steel* are all varried and amazing.  
Megadeth's *Rust in Peace*  
Half of Saxon's albums from that era (e.g., *Dogs of War* is a breath of fresh air)

Regarding your remark about the first 4 Metallica albums, those are definitely the best in my opinion. In fact, I don't like the Black Album or anything afterwards.

Metallica was great at well crafted thrash that could incorporate melodic elements. I never understood the point of the punch pulling commercial metal version of Metallica that started with the Black Album. 

In any event, two really good thrash metal albums from that period are Slayer's Reign In Blood and Sepultura's Arise, though neither is as well crafted as peak Metallica (which would be Ride The Lightning and Master of Puppets in my opinion).",2025-03-30 01:20:23,1,tiddertag,music

I seem to remember someone saying you need to turn off the “Autoplay Similar Songs” feature? Which is basically just the feature that makes Spotify keep auto playing different songs once your selected playlist ends. So if you’re listening to a playlist, and want Spotify to keep playing random stuff of its choice once the playlist is over, you turn that on.

But apparently that feature also causes Spotify to play a lot of the same stuff when you’re listening to your own playlists and have shuffle turned on. 

They should be separate features but they’re baked in together for some reason. When I turned it off, I got a lot more variation in my “Liked Songs” playlist which is 2,000+ songs. But when I’m listening to a smaller playlist or a single song, it won’t keep playing music once that song or playlist ends. Which is annoying.",2025-04-09 12:50:44,1,lets_just_n0t,music

mmzwx1v,1jwqbwp,reddit,"The sound was total garbage. Time alignment was heinous. Couldn’t understand 75% of lyrics.

I believe the problem is they were playing from the stage speakers and all of the house speakers hanging from above. Multiple sets of house speakers at different distances = horribly slurred music.

It was REALLLY BAD. Worst audio of any concert I have ever been to. Honestly, if they let ticketholders stream a video with soundboard audio from the show, that would be awesome. Then I could actually enjoy the show I was expecting to see.

We were front row in the 300’s, about half of our row left halfway through the concert. Glancing about later, I’d say 15% of people up top seemed to have left early.

I’m no sound engineer, but playing half of the upper house speakers (every other set) would have likely been a huge help, since then any other playing would have been further off-axis (several DB drop) plus further away (loudness drops with square of distance) to greatly reduce the slurring. Also likely possible to just run 18db/octave low pass 60hz on the every other set if they thought wouldn’t be able to carry the bass. 

The question then becomes, are all the upper hanging house speakers one channel? Or are they configured as individual channels? If they are all indivudual, then it becomes a whole lot easier. Figure average distance of the each set aimed at a given section of the 300’s from the seats, figure distance from mains, do time alignment to match. Move down two sections and repeat so you have additional delay as you move away from the stage.

Other option would be to play vocals from every other set and guitar from alternate sets. Again, take advantage of the off-axis rolloff.

But if the whole set of house speakers acts as one channel and you can’t do anything with it, then perhaps they should have just run 60hz low pass to them and done what they could with the mains by the stage to carry the rest.

Again, Id LOVE to be able to watch a video of the concert with soundboard audio, It looked like they put on an incredible show. But this was likely my only chance to see them in my lifetime and it was ruined by horrible sound.",2025-04-14 02:11:55,2,Alieges,music

Also simply do what I do. Pay what it's worth to you. If it's too expensive or if there isn't room inside for everyone then it's OK not to go. 

If everyone thought like I did then marked up resale and face prices rising higher than inflation would never be possible. Sold out shows also crash on the secondary when people refuse to pay those prices.

There's too much money involved for the powers that be to allow a fairer system. In the end it's about supply and demand, and as long as there are people willing to pay high prices, someone will be happy to exploit them.

I sometimes wonder if the real issue is on the demand side. With the exception of community orchestras, back in the 70s and 80s you rarely saw middle aged and older concert attendees.

Technically nothing stops you from scalping your phone. I could see that happening with AAA acts to get around this. But the new ticket cost would be so high to recoup the cost of a phone that it brings us to..

2) Don't pay markup prices. If the ticket was originally 100 and now it is being scalped at 200, don't buy it. Don't pay a cent higher than the original cost.

Let them have the tickets.

Seriously, this is the way. When a ticket goes on sale, if a bot buys it, let the bot have it. They obviously wanted it, they paid for it, and now they own it. That ticket is purchased, you didn't get it. Accept it.

That's it. That's all you have to do and this will stop.

But this isn't the question you were really asking, is it? What you really meant to ask is: How do we kill the bots *without sacrificing anything*?

If you're not willing to sacrifice, have you considered the possibility that you are totally 100% okay with what's happening? If a bot buys a ticket and then you buy it from the bot at a markup, was that not a free exchange? Is there some reason you had to participate?

No. You did it because you wanted to do it, and you're okay with it. So why should I or anyone else care about this if you don't?",2025-04-16 20:47:33,1,dickbutt_md,music

His daughter has informed me it’s due to personal circumstances.” Best reposted the tweet to his own page, writing, “I had a blast. Thank you.”



>Best was the drummer for the Beatles from 1960 to 1962 with John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison. He joined the band as they would often play at his mother’s establishment, the Casbah Club, and he established a rapport with the group. After several years, Beatles manager Brian Epstein dismissed him from the band at the members’ request and replaced him with Ringo Starr after the group’s first recording session. Best’s drumming was later featured on the Beatles’ 1995 compilation “Anthology 1,” where he played on several tracks.",2025-04-08 21:53:44,21,cmaia1503,music

He is unsurprisingly kinda caught up on lyrical quality of metal though. Understandable, there are stand outs but metal isn't really something you get into for the lyrics.

Fewer than 10 people still had the strength/interest in seeing Murphy after NIN wrecked the place. (We wandered back in during Murphy’s sat and, just as quickly, wandered back out. The energy the room had just an hour ago was completely gone.)

Anyway, by the 3rd time we saw NIN, still touring PHM, they were headlining.

mny0dy0,1k2wmqw,reddit,"And what if there’s a single independent musician that doesn’t have the skills or means to make visual art to go along with their track?  And or if they output more music than visual art to go along with it?  Do they have a connect?  Could they get help from someone?  What if they can’t and stuck with what they can do only by themselves?

It’s different for singular independent artists, or even artists that are lonely, to have ai help them come up with a visual cover.  Other than a band lets say or a group of musicians, where the likely hood of them knowing a visual artist could be higher than the individual who only has themselves.  Oh yea, and they also have to pay for the visual art, unless if one is generous and gives the visual for free.

It’s a brand new kind of art, at the cost of the environment, to fill in this puzzle piece that some musicians can’t fill so they rely on this choice to at the least have a full completed artwork along with their track, album, or compilation.",2025-04-19 15:57:41,-12,Zharo,music

To each their own—some artists just want to focus on making music, and that’s perfectly fine. But if you're choosing what to listen to based solely on album art, were you ever really into the music to begin with? Let the sound speak louder than the visuals.
That being said, I’ve seen your cover art, and honestly, it feels pretty dated. It looks like it would mostly appeal to an older audience or fans of grunge and classic rock. Just from the design alone, I don’t see it grabbing the attention of younger listeners.
There’s nothing wrong with using AI art—especially when you tweak and customize it to fit your vision. This post gives off “I’m stuck in my ways and want everyone else to be too” energy. The reality is AI is here, it’s growing fast, and there’s no stopping it. You either embrace it or get left behind—just like every generation has had to do with new tech.
Personally, I love being able to just type what I need, get an image, and move on to the next task. I’ve got music to make, videos to edit, contracts to mix, sound design, websites, and a hundred other things to juggle as a music producer. If one part of that process becomes faster and more accessible—even if it’s not free—I’m all for it.
Do I feel bad for graphic designers? Sure, but that’s not my path. Could AI take my job too? Absolutely. But I welcome the challenge. I dare it to make something as original as me. If I were a graphic designer, I’d level up my skills or pivot before it’s too late.

There’s literally an entire generation that won’t even click on a cover unless it looks like AI art. Let that sink in. You can either adapt or stick with what worked before—but just know it won’t hit the same anymore. It’s a numbers game now, and like always, the younger generation drives the trends in music. They decide what moves and what fades out.

I’m part of the old head generation, but even I can see there’s no beating AI. Yeah, it sucks—but it is what it is. Complaining won’t change anything. You either ride the wave or get out the way.",2025-04-19 16:38:51,-12,KingdomOfKushLLC,music

mjzufak,1jl1t0i,reddit,"The song ""Idiots Are Taking Over"" from NOFX's album *The War on Errorism* serves as a critique of political apathy and the state of leadership during the early 2000s, particularly targeting the administration of George W. Bush. This theme has garnered renewed relevance, as many feel that the socio-political landscape remains unchanged, suggesting a continuity of discontent through time, particularly relevant in recent election cycles.

The last time I saw them I was a bit tipsy and I yelled out ""I'll buy $50 worth of merch if you play Street Waves.""  Two seconds later they launched into the opening riff, and the place lit up. I bought a shirt and a live double album from 1977.

Thomas had some great, curmudgeonly stage banter.  He saw a guy in the audience wearing a Pink Floyd shirt and said ""For every guy that shows up wearing a Pink Floyd shirt, that's three girls that decided not to come.""  Right to the guy's face.

It was an unforgettable performance that helped me understand the transformative power of music. Seeing him perform when I was in high school changed the course of my life. I had always felt like an outsider growing up and watching him on stage helped me to understand that it was OK to be different, to stand out, to take the road less traveled by. In fact, it was essential.” 



>“Over the decades it hurt me to know that someone I admired so much shared his dislike of me publicly as an artist,” she considered. “I didn’t understand it. I was told Elton John was the musical guest on ‘SNL’ and I decided to go. I needed to go backstage and confront him . When I met him, the first thing out of his mouth was, ‘Forgive me,’ and the wall between us fell down. Forgiveness is a powerful tool.

mkpyw24,1jo99qz,reddit,"Ringo Starr is among the most scrutinized, fetishized, analyzed, and catechized people in history. Mark Leibovich spent about a year reporting on the former Beatles drummer—whom the world still needs. [https://theatln.tc/dYWUgEqA](https://theatln.tc/dYWUgEqA)

When Leibovich met Starr, now age 84, he had a new record to promote—a solo record. “Starr looks remarkably well maintained for his age,” Leibovich continues. “He is also one of those rare figures whose face has been such a fixture of our cultural lives for so long that his actual, three-dimensional presence in front of you elicits a double take. Is this the genuine cargo or some wiry wisp of a Ringo impersonator?”

Decades after his Beatles days, Starr still considers himself a “band guy”: “I need a group of guys,” he told Leibovich. “I need the bass player and the guitar players.” Since 1989, Starr has been playing and touring with a revolving cast of old musical buddies in “Ringo Starr and His All Starr Band.” “I wondered why Starr was still subjecting himself to this grind,” Leibovich writes. “If nothing else, it illustrated how being a ‘band guy’ remains essential to his center of gravity.” Before a recent concert at the Venetian in Las Vegas, Starr pointed to the empty theater: “Tonight, this space will be all peace and love,” he vowed. 

“If the Beatles at Shea Stadium in ’65 was packed with shrieking teenage fans, the All Starrs at the Venetian incubated quite a different ambiance about six decades later,” Leibovich writes. But when the first chords of “Octopus’s Garden” twang out, “the crowd goes an aging version of nuts. Everyone sings along. I sense some earnest effort in the theater to make this gathering count for more than just nostalgia.”

mn0tlsc,1jyplhm,reddit,"It's not weird, it's just 2/4.  2/4 time is more common in folk music for a couple reasons:  often, this type of music lacks percussion - the 2/4 helps drive the music without percussion without it sounding hollow. 4/4 is more empty feeling.  When there's only 1 or 2 musicians (common in folk music), filling up melodic space is also necessary, so this music makes use of drone tones which work better in 2/4 because you can contrast the drone with the other melodic components on the up beats without it getting too complicated.  Violin and banjo folk are heavy on the drone tones.  The song above, he's droning with both the banjo and his voice in some parts with the rest of the melody being the other parts of the vocals.  

2/4 is also easy to divide up to do polyrythms over for things like vocals.  6/8 over 2/4 or 4/4 sounds beautiful.",2025-04-14 06:41:03,13,ChiAnndego,music

mn0fxgi,1jyplhm,reddit,"First off: you’re absolutely right that this performer is not paying any attention to what we call a time signature. And you hear it in a lot of these old recordings - even up into the Carter Family if I remember right. They’re just untrained amateurs singing and playing what sounds cool to them, the way their parents and grandparents who taught them did. Many of the people making this kind of music were barely literate and almost certainly had no formal music training.

You know when you hear amateurs sing a capella and they rush through rests? It feels natural if you haven’t been trained since childhood to not do that. When kids learn to read music, there’s a *lot* of time spent clapping through rhythms and counting out loud before it becomes second nature. If you’ve never had that training, and neither have any of the people around you, and recorded music doesn’t really exist yet, you’re not going to absorb time signatures through the ether.

Edit: see discussion below for my apologies for my abysmal phrasing above. I wasn’t trying to say that they’re idiots for not knowing formal western music theory, though I can see how it came off that way.",2025-04-14 04:33:06,26,bobfossilsnipples,music

mn1fqxv,1jyplhm,reddit,"Okay! I have two slightly wild theories here: Conductors and work songs. I know that you’re talking about more pop music than classical but trends in one influences the other. 

So. The role of a conductor only really became a thing around 1820, before then you’d have a lead musician who would play and kind of conduct at the same time. As music became more intricate and complex, a dedicated conductor became a necessity who in turn allowed things to get even crazier! If you look at the orchestral compositions (especially Franz Liszt) of the time you’ll see that they were pushing the boundaries and really making interesting and intricate pieces. This, of course, spread to other less formal styles of music as a lot of musicians have at least some classical training. 

Now to my second theory: work songs! Work songs were used to keep everyone in time when you had to do things in unison, like pulling a rope, working wool, or picking cotton. These songs had to have a certain rhythm that couldn’t deviate from its BPM much or have a difficult time signature or else it would be too difficult for everyone to follow. They also relied heavily on call and response to keep everyone engaged in the song. Look at how sea shanties and folk songs had a huge resurgence during the pandemic! They’re usually easy to learn and easy to join in with and they’re simple. But with machinery being used more and more in place of people and louder working conditions, they became less useful and less common outside of pubs and folk music. People are always making up new songs and if they don’t need to have a steady beat then people will experiment with different styles. 

An unsung (pun intended) form of work song is field music used by armies to communicate during battles. They got phased out by the end of WWI- just in time for jazz! Suddenly the trumpet wasn’t just a loud thing to be heard across a battlefield! Trumpets got rotary valves around 1820 as well! So you’ve got a bunch of veterans who are out of a job and needing something to play that isn’t just drum core and field music (because who wants to play something that reminds everyone of the hell they survived), and a mixing of ideas and styles from Europe and around the world! That’s a recipe for innovation 

I don’t know if any of that made sense at all but it’s my two cents!",2025-04-14 10:34:19,2,ileisen,music

Was gob smacked by the death of Cliff. Eagerly awaited with wonder how they would move on. *Garage Days Revisited* introduced us to Jason.
*Justice for All...* Releases with epic eight minute songs. Incredible.

I saw them in that tour at the Oakland Arena and it was amazing. 


I kinda jumped off the Metallica wagon as they worked through new material (and their issues).

But you like Pink Floyd and like Wish You Were Here and The Wall. DSOM is really an almost seamless extension of those other records. You could almost mix and match songs from those three records and it would be a typical (post Syd Barrett) Pink Floyd record. I know Pink Floyd some fans prefer some of their other records over DSOM, but never met a Floyd fan who didn't really like it. You seem to be a first.

Let me tell you, after starting from his debut album, putting on Highway 61 Revisited was mind blowing. Like a Rolling Stone was a whole new song even though I'd heard it many times before. What a rush that must have been for Dylan fans hearing it for the first time in the 60s.

And the crazy thing is that it was his sixth album in just over 3 years!

His lyrical work, but specifically also the way he sang with limited vocal means... it will always inspire me to do better. And it also reminds me that two chords are enough sometimes. Song For Woody is a good example. 


If you watch the recent film, it might put you into another existential crisis if you're a songwriter, because it all seems so effortless to the actor. But I am sure Dylan worked hard. And he caught a great big wave.


I wish the film had showed more of Woody Guthrie, who is a huge inspiration to me as a musician. No early Dylan without Guthrie. Anyone who thinks art and specifically music should avoid politics has never explored these legends. Seeger too.",2025-04-08 06:53:56,7,Helsafabel,music

""I Shall Be Free"" - this one is him being really funny. Really have to listen to the lyrics.   
""Hurricane"" - it's a classic. and an awesome song. about a true story. there's a movie about it.   
""Masters of War"" - a great anti war protest song.

https://youtu.be/ITz36at74u8?si=PJJLFwdG-nxoK3La

Horror fiction was already popular in the 50s with pulp books, horror movies, etc.

By the 60s, horror was sort of campy with shows like the Munsters, and Dark Shadows.

It was the Damned that made goth popular because the singer dressed like the guy from Dark Shadows.

Bauhaus are the ones who really set the standard. Peter Murphy was like Bowie's cool little brother.

She had a moog taurus and was doubling some of the bass lines with it. Just massive bottom end. All in all, I've seen them about 10-12 times since 1988 and  the Beacon shows were as good or better than any of the other shows I'd seen. 2 solid hours, lots of surprises/new (to me) arrangements and all in all just super professional. The sound helped a lot. Beacon is just a great sounding room.

Their set list will be expansive, but they fly through it quickly. They play the songs exactly like the albums but at a faster tempo. There is also zero stage banter.

I think I figured out my “sound” in (and around) High School age (+/- a few years).

Then I just kind of stayed there for a few years.  Until I was 30 I don’t think I deliberately sought out new/different styles/sounds of music.   I’d stumble across a new song every now and then and kind of go down a rabbit hole of “what the hell genre is this and what else sounds like it?”  But it wasn’t systematic. 

Then in my mid/late 30’s (I’m 41 now) I started really engaging with the music, the subtle interplay between two wildly different influences or styles that shouldn’t work together but totally do. 

Right now I’m on a big Ska/Emo kick. You wouldn’t think they’d work together. But it slaps. 

Before that I was rediscovering Metal from the early days up through Electric Callboy.  None of these bands … Hell none of these genres were around when I was in High School. 

But the same zany skater punk energy from TRL 1997 is present in a lot of this stuff, even tho it probably got there in its own way and it’s doing its own thing.

mod6zq7,1k4v86l,reddit,"TLDR: I can ~~probably~~ definitely count on one hand the amount of new artists I’ve discovered past 21 that I then went on to become a really big fan of since. Although I definitely do find a fair bit of individual songs that I’ll fall in love with and go on to wear out.

I’ll still discover and listen to new music at 26, but it’s just… different. The days of me doing a deep dive into a new sub genre or artist, furiously consuming entire back catalogs, or listening to album after album multiple times to really “get” it are lonnnnnnng gone. It’s actually a little difficult to find the drive to listen to a whole album by an artist I’m not already a really big fan of in general. Nowadays I’ll usually just find new *songs* I really like, and that’ll be added to my rotation at whatever given point in time. When I was in my teens and maybe even up to 21 or so I’d pride myself on doing real deep dives to broaden my horizon’s, and would absolutely love having in depth conversations about music with people. These that’s a much taller task.

90% of the time I’d much rather listen to a podcast if anything, and my musical tastes are much more of a solitary thing for me than they used to be, which in and of itself kinda dampens the drive to discover new stuff. I also find myself skimming through songs a lot more than I used to. If something doesn’t immediately pop for me I’ll just move on. I’d say the easiest way for me to get into new stuff is just if my wife is listening to something which really catches my attention, and as a result I’ve found myself listening to some stuff I wouldn’t have been caught dead listening to when I was younger. One example of that would be a lot of the same old country music I used to hate when I was growing up and always hearing it from my parents, or Chappell Roan’s ‘Hot to Go,’ which I was immediately in love with from the very first time I heard it in her car.

Overall my engagement with music is just a lot shallower than it used to be, and I think that’s okay. I never thought I’d see the day where I find more enjoyment listening to political talk shows than Hip Hop or Metal, or would ever be willingly seeking out pop music, or mid 2000s country, but here I am.",2025-04-22 02:29:51,2,Wellsargo,music

It may simply be because our younger brain physically develops stronger neural bonds with experiences that happen between the ages of 10-30 than those at any other point in life.

I think what happens often is that, first and foremost, the average person enjoys music on a very casual and passive basis. When you remove the social structure of school you no longer have a large group of peers to filter what is cool and socially relevant when it comes to music. Additionally, younger people are typically marketed to much heavier than adults typically are when it comes to music - both directly and indirectly.

modhwky,1k4v86l,reddit,"I'd guess at least half of all people, at least in the USA, have a sort of ""psychic freeze"" (to quote Negativland) around the age of high school/college. It's most apparent in matters of culture, like taste in music, movies, etc., but also applies to their general personalities as well. This is why you'll find tons of people swearing that the best music ever made was what they listened to in high school, and they never seem to really grow and explore and move on from those artists. 

""Modern music is trash."" Well, yeah, if all you listen to is what the algorithm and Top 40 radio feeds you. It takes effort and curiosity and a genuine love of music to search out the good stuff.

mogqbfx,1k4v86l,reddit,"I always assumed that I would be chasing new music until I die. My dad (a musician) would listen to the Golden Oldies station all day, even while he was in a band that played covers of more contemporary music. I couldn't stand it, and I couldn’t fathom settling into the music that was popular when I was younger, and not trying to at least stay current, let alone expand my horizons. But I have a little more understanding of it now that I'm old.

  
I still seek out new music. It's an amazing time to be a music lover - there aren't industry gatekeepers, and we now have almost limitless avenues to find new bands and hear new songs. But even the new music that I love, it doesn't all ""stick."" I probably listen to the new stuff while driving in my car or sitting at my desk. It doesn't transport me to that first job at the movie theater, or carpooling to school with my idiot friends, or just a time when life had more discretionary hours to be wasted on stupid shit. 



Those songs from high school are tied to core memories in my formative years. They might even be the first songs that ""spoke"" to us, that we connected with on a deeper level than just ""this slaps."" But ""this slaps"" is also a huge hit of dopamine, so that gets coded into our tastes. I’ll go years without hearing some of the stuff I loved in school—and I don’t miss it. But when it shows up organically, I still crank it.

  
Also, back then it was more passive (because the internet wasn't a thing.) Back then, music just *found* you—on the radio, on MTV, in your friend’s car. Now, discovering new music feels more like an active pursuit. It’s a search. Some of my new favorites are amazing songs to which I have no memories associated, and some of my old favorites are dogshit cringey tracks that I still consider ""guilty pleasures"" because they take me somewhere in my mind.

  
But, I'm on the other side of it now: I have a wife and a young son, and new (or ""new to me"") songs are starting to get sticky, because they pull my brain to a time when I was rocking my son to sleep or bonding with my wife. Or the songs that my wife puts on for a dance party with our son - those songs are ratcheted up in my emotional ranking because there's such a core memory tied to them.",2025-04-22 17:26:54,2,whiskyfuktober,music

The enemy tanks for a while   
And the Anzio bridgehead   
Was held for the price   
Of a few hundred ordinary lives

And kind old King George  
Sent mother a note   
When he heard that father was gone   
It was, I recall   
In the form of a scroll   
With gold leaf adorned

And I found it one day   
In a drawer of old photographs, hidden away   
And my eyes still grow damp to remember   
His Majesty signed   
With his own rubber stamp

It was dark all around   
There was frost in the ground   
When the tigers broke free   
And no one survived   
From the Royal Fusiliers Company Z

So, wife and I went to a few concerts from bands I knew/loved.  started noticing the same people were attending. we started talking (hey we should be friends we love the same music!).  learned about DJs at particular bars/clubs. started going, and discovered new-to-me songs (how I missed book of love (boy, I touch roses), romeo void (never say never) and new order (age of consent)).  befriended the DJs, who introduced me to other bands I missed (Chameleons UK was one of them).

And started digging through those acts, reading articles on them, what else have they done (like has one gone off and did some other acts?). found +++ (crosses) that Chino from deftones did,  phil campbell and the bastard sons (motorhead guitarist). the creatures (siouxsie sioux from siouxsie and the banshees). plus bands they like/admire (death (not the metal band), slint, crass, the adicts, jawbreaker, voivod.

Some of those DJs introduced me to other DJs, and I started discovering newer acts in goth, industrial, and alternative (tr/st, boy harsher, leather strip, hocico, rosegarden funeral party, ACTORS).

And as concerts started getting more and more expensive for the big established acts, I started shifting to newer acts whose ticket prices were more reasonable.  Some discovered as opening acts to those bigger artists. Or I heard some buzz and decided, oh what the heck, youtube and watch them.  Found Gojira and Jinjer that way. Subscribed to some youtube channels, found bloodywood and house of protection from tankthetech. People raving about sleep token.  

Attended a few festivals and showed up for the earlier acts. Discovered twin tribes, spiritbox, drain, scowl, FEA, molchat doma, among others.

just kinda keeping an ear out, reading comments like in youtube, reddit, etc., and if I see a bunch of people raving about some band, I'll check them out on youtube.  Found Amyl & the sniffers, beartooth, orange goblin.

or even at record stores, spot the disk, and think, ah, what the heck.  discovered acid bath, dead pioneers, mercury rev, the nymphs. been exceptionally lucky, haven't gotten any clunkers yet (that I recall!).

mob1j9u,1k4et96,reddit,"Hey!  I’m 46 and love modern music and I’m always discovering new bands. 

Here’s how I do it:

1 - get in on local or national tour announcements and look up and listen to the bands listed that you don’t know.

I get email blasts from Bowery Presents, Dice, Avant Gardner, Goldenvoice, along with local venues

2 - I subscribe to emails for Rough Trade Records and learn about new releases and check them out.  

3 - my Instagram feed is nothing but music venues, artists, labels, and cats. 

4- use streaming services to help you. Work with the algorithm.  

Example - someone I follow, posted a video a few years back of a collab between two young people I’ve never heard of. 

So I look them both up and find the main artist is boring and the guests, who produced it, sound amazing. 

So I play their music on Apple Music. Afterwards, I have it set up where it then plays similar artists and I find LOTS of new artists from this way.  

What’s crazy is sometimes they blow up and I got into them sometimes before their album comes out or they’re from another country and no one here knows them.

I mostly (not completely) stay away from pop and metal, but if it falls under the indie/alternative banners, you'll find it there.  Rock, alt rock, alt country, folk, punk, post punk, emo, garage rock and sometimes even jazz or rap influenced groups.

Find a song or artist you do like and start a radio play of them to get some similar bands or at least stuff other folks have enjoyed that also liked your band.

Speaking of other people, they have ""community playlists"" that you can browse for new stuff.

I found some great stuff by following up on some message boards.  Someone would nention a group and 10 folks would pile on about how much they love it so, I'd check it out.

All standing? Wear some comfortable shoes. Best thing about all standing shows is you can move around.

Getting some quality earplugs is a good idea, especially if you plan to go to concerts more regularly in the future. I defintiely regret not using them sooner on the days where the tinnitus and muffled hearing is bad.

Edit: Don't feel as if you NEED to go with someone because the whole point of going is because YOU want to go and see the people on the stage.

mjsodsn,1jk530u,reddit,"Hey there:

When I was younger, I was in a position very similar to the one you're now in. I was either 17 or close to that age, and went to see Fall Out Boy in their heyday. No one I knew could/wanted to go, so I went by myself.

Personally, I barely remember the concert. It was really overwhelming to be surrounded by so many people. It was hard for me to just enjoy the show, because it was just too much for me to be in a crowd that big (1000+, give or take), and I really would have preferred to just have more room to breathe, watch, listen and enjoy the show without the vast swathes of sweaty bodies all around me that reeked of beer and pot. Whether or not I had anyone to go with probably wouldn't have changed that, honestly.

As I got older, I went to more and more shows - they rarely felt comfortable, despite eventually becoming someone who would crowdsurf and mosh all the time. In hindsight, I wish I'd been self-aware enough to realize how uncomfortable it all made me. I do have some great stories from some of those shows, but I often wonder about whether or not it was worth making myself so uncomfortable to go see these shows I can only remember little bits and pieces of, even when I did go with friends.

Anyway, back to you: Should you go? You could certainly give it a shot - I think it might be worthwhile to discover whether you enjoy that kind of setting or not. And simultaneously, if you discover you aren't really comfortable in crowds, that is absolutely okay, too. I know I'm certainly not one for concerts anymore (at least ones that I'm not performing at - I play in a couple of bands, and love being onstage), but I have tons of friends who love going to them, and I'm sure many people here will speak to the incredible times they've had at live shows.

Lastly - I think other people in the thread have said it already, but if you feel unsafe or uncomfortable at any time, it's definitely okay to go out and get some fresh air (don't forget to hang onto some proof of purchase, though - definitely don't want to get stuck out there). Depending on the show/venue, the bathrooms can be quite packed, so going there for a breather might prove to be difficult. And hanging out at the back of the venue can help you not feel too swarmed - depending on how tall you are, you may have trouble seeing, though, so try to find a good spot before the show starts!

If you decide to go, I hope you have a great time! And if not, we live in an age where thankfully, you can watch live videos of just about any band via YouTube - it's obviously a very different experience, but it's a completely viable alternative to a live show if you're not into those.

If you do end up in the mosh, don't worry! The moshers are usually the nicest people in the spot! Just kind of bounce off of people till u get to the side and slide out. Pretty easy. If you fall, put your hands out to the side and someone will grab you and pick you up

Don't take a drink if someone offers it to you, 1: you'll get kicked out by venue staff since you're underage, and 2: you don't know what they did with that drink. In fact, don't consume anything given to you by anyone who isn't behind a bar, and if what they give to you leaves your sight, it's not yours anymore 

I'm not sure if people crowdsurf to the warning, but if you do end up at the front, keep an eye behind you and be ready to catch people and move em forward towards the front. That's rlly all u need to know tbh.

mjt4wbk,1jk530u,reddit,"Yes. I’ve gone to loads of concerts by myself. 

Once the band starts playing it’s really not any different from going with friends, as we usually get a bit separated once the crowd starts moving anyway. 

I always prefer going with friends just to have someone to talk to in between sets and such, but I’ve also always had a good time when I end up going by myself. 

Also, if you don’t want to get rowdy in the crowd you can chill near the sides or the back. That’s where people usually go when they just wanna stand and watch. But you’re young and newer to going to concerts so I’d encourage you to try to get near the front if you’re up for it!

I wound up talking to this other girl and we decided we wanted to be closer to the stage.

Yes ear protection 100%. 

Find a female security guard & tell her you're there on your own & ask if she could come check on you periodically cuz it's your first solo concert. I did this because I had just had back surgery & knew I couldn't adequately defend myself if something happened. She was amazing. She checked on me & walked me to the drink line & merch line to make sure no one bumped me. It helped me relax & enjoy the music knowing someone was watching my back. 

Get a drink cover. Most concerts now pour your water into a plastic cup instead of leaving you a bottle, some asshat threw it I'm sure is the reason. So instead of having a huge open cup for anyone to roofie, there's lots of creeps out there, you can protect yourself & again relax a little bit. 

Text a friend that you trust during breaks & make sure they reply back to you. Establish a plan if something happens and you don't message them on your schedule. They need to know that you may need emergency help if you go x hours without a text. 

Bottom line, without anyone with you you have to find other ways to get support in the event you do have a problem. Better to have it & not need it than need it & not have it.

mmta21d,1jv48jz,reddit,"I have the Etymotic ones.  To be clear, my aim is to reduce the volume, not block the sound altogether.  

I have mixed feelings about the Etymotics.  They definitely reduce the sound *level*, but they also reduce the quality.  I was hoping that they'd just make it quieter but you'd still hear the bass and high-frequency signals in the same proportion.  That's not really what happens (for me at least).  

I can still hear high frequencies pretty well, but the bass is strongly reduced.  

There's a strong occlusion effect (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occlusion\_effect), which seems to mean that when you've got something filling your ear canal, you can hear a lot of your own voice by bone-conductance which makes you feel a bit like you're underwater.

Overall, at a concert, I wear them for a while, but I take them out for the songs or bands I really want to hear.

On the upside, they're a good snug fit for me, unlike regular earbuds that either don't fit in my ears, or just fall out or work their way loose.  

Also, if I'm a a concert and talking to someone, they have the benefit of somehow compressing all the sounds together, so I can hear one person talking me to a fair bit more easily.  The other part of this is that the occlusion effect means that I can talk comfortably in that setting and hear *myself* so I don't feel the need to shout.  This in particular is something I find really good.",2025-04-12 23:26:18,1,moose_und_squirrel,music

There were also hundreds if not thousands of people who couldn't get into the tent to see them, it was so packed. I saw at least five other artists make pro-Palestine statements including Green Day, one of the headliners. 

A wrinkle that I don't see mentioned in coverage is that Infected Mushroom, an Israeli artist, also played at the festival. I saw footage of people at their set draped in Israeli flags. 

These artists can and should be playing the same events. An artist is booked for a time slot and it's up to them how they use it. Not every artist is going to have the same views, same politics, and same musical style, but the fact that all of them get to exist at the same event is what makes events like Coachella so awesome.",2025-04-24 18:27:05,29,IslandDrummer,music

Buckdancer's Choice is a collection of poems by James Dickey.  The actual poem, ""Buckdancer's Choice"" is about a young boy who listened to his mother whistle an old Minstrel Song (also Buckdancer's Choice) as she is slowly losing her ability to breath. It is her last fight to show she's alive.  What choices there are for for the last dancers of their kind?  The whistling become transcendent for the boy listening.

The song ""Buckdancer's Choice"" is about lost or unrequited love.  It talks about shooting out the street lights but leaving the porch light on, then burying every hope you've ever dreamed of.

The Dead tie it together with:  
It's a buck dancer's choice, my friend  
Better take my advice  
You know all the rules by now  
And the fire from the ice  
Will you come with me?

Sid was a sad case, whose participation in the band was basically so John had a good friend around, and he looked the part. 

But he was a truly messed up kid and he ended up a murderer…

mm4jn4c,1jurbqp,reddit,"You're already into metal.  For fun go listen to like bring me the horizons first two albums.  You'll notice a very very distinct difference. 

The choice now is just what does your ear like?  Do you like blast beats and drops, do you like Melody, do you like clean vocals with hard backing?  It's time to explore. 

Although not really metal, bands like ghost, night wish, and sleep token scratch a metal esque itch for many while still being understandable to untrained ears.  This can lead to black metal bands. 

Then you have the nu metal esque stuff where everything from limp Bizkit to slipknot fall.  It's not a really well defined genre in my opinion but I find many of my favorite bands fall into this category that I constantly listen to.  Could be my age though as well attributing to this. 

Next we get into the slightly heavier stuff like miss may I, of mice and men, black Dahlia murder, lamb of god, asking Alexandria etc etc etc etc.  There are so many of these intermediate bands that are good. This is stuff that also holds another soft spot in my heart but again, I'm old. 

Finally we get into the really heavy like Lorna shore (amazing band), slaughter to prevail, kill Whitney dead, chimera, cannibal corpse etc etc etc.  This is the area where taste comes into play as well as your ability to discern lyrics.  It takes time, and a desire to develop an ear for it but it can be rewarding if it's something you enjoy as both a technical front and an artistry standpoint. 

Overall, just keep listening, keep finding bands, pull up YouTube and click a song you know and like, scroll the side till you find a band you don't know and click it.  Continue on until you're 60 clicks deep.  You'll find stuff you like and stuff you hate.  Then just comes the curation of your taste.  Glhf.",2025-04-08 23:50:57,8,hoogin89,music

Vol II"" and Run To The Hills by Iron Maiden, I was led there by my desire to explore the world of rock as I was sure that glam must've led somewhere. I still bloody love glam rock, Sweet, Slade, Wizzard all that good stuff. 

  
Anyway, these days I listen to DreamTheater, Nightwish, Epica, Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Watain, Tailgunner, Venom, Children of Bodom, Helloween and Manowar and a lot more, heavier, lighter, newer, older if it's got verve, energy and sounds good then i listen to it.

mm74ppr,1jurbqp,reddit,"Dig back into the roots. Metalcore and deathcore bands that started those genres for example like Darkest Hour, despised icon, the red chord or for metal core the early bands like Killswitch Engage, all that remains, as I lay dying. 

From there branch into the melodic death metal / Gothenburg scene with bands like in flames, carcass, dark tranquility, the black dahlia murder, the haunted, arch enemy. Then further back into death metal where you can listen to the classic American bands like Death, Morbid Angel, Deicide, Obituary as well as the Swedish Scene (Entombed, Dismember, Grave and first couple albums from Therion, Tiamat, Katatonia), the Dutch scene (Pestilence, Asphyx), and UK (bolt thrower, benediction, first couple Anathema albums).

Throw in some more progressive or out of the box kind of bands as well. There’s Opeth who started in the Swedish death metal scene but went more into the melodic and then progressive rock/metal side of things. Bands like Between the Buried and Me are the more progressive metalcore side, and you get bands like The Dillinger Escape Plan which was huge with the mathcore branch of metal core. 

If you want to keep digging into the roots of death metal then your next steps are thrash metal bands like Possessed (usually also the first death metal band depending how you slice it), Sepultura’s first couple albums. There’s also the German scene of Kreator, Destruction, Sodom, and Poison (not that poison) or the Canadian bands like Sacrifice, Razor, and Slaughter (again, not that Slaughter, look for the album Strappado), or European bands like Onslaught and Bulldozer. That was traditional metal like Judas Priest, Iron Maiden and the like mixed with the fast Uk and European hardcore styles like discharge, anti-cimex, and so on.

Edit: also throw grindcore into the mix eventually. The classics and arguable standard bands of the genre are Napalm Death, early Carcass (first 2 albums, some of the third), Nasum, Pig Destroyer, Agorophobic Nosebleed, Repulsion, Terrorizer. This branches more into the punk genre in one direction (powerviolence bands like Spazz, Crossed Out, Despise You) and the noise genre in other direction (the locust, the berzerker) among plenty of other examples. Goregrind like Haemorrhage, Exhumed, Birdflesh, General Surgery is another offshoot and tends to blend fast paced songs and some aspects of death metal more than their punk counterparts",2025-04-09 12:04:31,2,ForestPoetry,music

When I first listened to it, I felt it wasn't that good and of course, it wasn't. Though I didn't get headaches, I didn't like the rhythm of the song and I couldn't listen to it completely. This is because our ears and the brain are sensitive to changes in sound volume and frequency, which can lead to different types of headaches, including tension headaches and migraines. Also there are some people out there who enjoy these kinds of songs, maybe their ears are not that sensitive compared to ours. But, yes I agree that it does.",2025-04-25 10:50:53,1,Ankush_Nath,music

Metallica gets shit on for their trajectory and the changes they made. Like it or not though, it at least makes sense. it all sounds like metallica. Pearl jam does whatever they want, but it still sounds like pearl jam even when they play a ukulele. finger eleven though? it's just stabs in arbitrary directions. im not sure if they were just failed attempts at cash grabs or were under order from the studio, but there is no identifiable finger eleven sound

It's interesting reading your post as I've been nostalgic so much about the 3 or 4 piece rock band that strikes gold with their catchy power chord rock tune. I'm 13 years older than you and for a while in the rock/alternative world in most of my teenage years, and beyond, you felt like just anyone out there could get big because they wrote a really great rock song with a killer hook. Usually just a handful of power chords and a good melody was all it took. 


I guess I feel nostalgic because I felt like for a while at a time a bunch of friends could form a band and with practice and some talent and some luck, they could make a name for themselves and maybe make it big one day. It felt obtainable and that was exciting. I cant say because I'm just old now but it feels like it's not really that way anymore. Are kids excited to form a garage band with their friends to make tunes and rock the city and their neighborhood and one day maybe make it on MTV and the radio and get big? It felt I knew so many kids that made their attempt at it in high school and their early 20s back then. It was fun man. 


Like you, i feel a bit sad for the loss of the past. But maybe as another poster mentioned...what's old will become new once again. 


Edit: it's funny cause I don't like the song paralyzer  but I'm happy they had that big tune that made it big. I saw them in 97 at the first concert id ever went to and heard them play the song ""tip"" and it blew my mind. I remember needing to know who they were so I could buy their cd. I'd never heard anything like it. That whole tip album is perfect. ",2025-04-25 02:47:11,8,Martian-Lynch,music

You can sell the rarest stuff online through discogs, eBay, or however you prefer, then a lot of the middle road stuff could probably be sold to a store. Won’t be a lot of money but figure selling a bunch of $10-20 records for $5 each to them is probably better than trying to sell those on discogs individually and deal with the shipping and extra hassle. The unsellable stuff after all that can probably go to goodwill or as a lot for $1 each.

Given the size, might be worth making a list. Given the time period my guess is focus on rock (psyche and garage styles especially) and jazz artists (blue note) and old blues and soul type stuff if anything goes back to the 50’s.",2025-03-31 14:15:14,3,Heavenwasfull,music

my mom and some friends smoking marijuana on an abandoned railroad bridge in mass. I had never smelled it before. Her friends were strangers to me.. and some guy scolded her for ""hogging"" the joint.

she started singing.

she died in 1992, ruled suicide..very drunk, hit by vehicle.

Our Battalion's first KIA was after the ""war"" in Iraq had ended.  This was late spring/early summer of 2003.  We were in al Dora, Baghdad, basically being police.  It was such a strange time.  The insurgency was just getting started.  A couple of our guys were at a propane filling station pulling guard.  Most homes there used re-fillable propane canisters for their kitchens, and keeping them operating and orderly was one of the things we were doing.  

Some guy walked up behind him with a pistol and blew him away, shot his partner through the neck, and disappeared.  His name was Mike Duell. 

We had a memorial ceremony at our Battalion headquarters compound.  According to his buddies, it was his favorite song, so at some point during, they played it.  It was surreal.  Fucking weird.  Any time I hear that song, I'm immediately transported back to the Dora and the junk palace at battalion.  Even typing this takes me back.

I was friends with this girl in college and there was always something there but neither of us really acted on it. We would always gravitate towards each other no matter the circumstances, whether it was a student government event, or project for the group that ran activities on campus, or just running into each other at a party. And the thing was...it was never awkward like some cheesy movie. It was picking up right where we left off. 

I knew she loved Coldplay and I got us tickets to see them play. The concert was Saturday night. We figured it all out and made plans on how to get down there and when and everything. The Friday night before I worked my usual gig at the campus comedy show and she did a babysitting gig to earn some extra money. 

Saturday rolls around and we are all set to go. We meet up and when we look at the tickets we discover the show was for the night before. We are broke college kids so we don't have money to get tickets for the Saturday show.

We go back to her dorm and we are both completely crestfallen. In some weird stupid desperate bid I put onA Rush of Blood to the Head and say let's pretend like we are there. She indulges me until The Scientist comes on. She stands in front of me and puts my arms around her shoulders and puts her hands on top of mine. She then begins to sway back and forth to the music with me behind her until ""but tell me you love me"" plays and she tilts her head back and looks up at me. I turn her around and kiss her. 

She later told me that her plan for the concert was to tell me she liked me during that song and she wasn't going to waste the chance to do even if our plans were ruined. 

Every time I hear the song I think about how and how soft her hands felt on mine and how she felt...and how I felt. And how I don't ever think I'll feel that way about someone again.",2025-04-05 07:28:24,2,joelupi,music

Not a horrible feeling but moreover a melancholy for me. I associate the song with a moment when I was about 12-13yr old and went to Seminole Canyon State Park(TX) with my father. We were going to camp overnight, wake up early, and go on a hike down into the canyon to see ancient(for the New World at least) cave paintings. 

  
Well, as we sat in our 89 F150 that night listening some radio and playing cards by the dome light(too windy for fire) while facing the Rio Grande and Mexico. As we played we watched as huge storms rolled across Northern Mexico and the mountains towards us.  Huge amounts of lightning were going off as it slowly rolled towards us. We bunkered down in the bed of the truck (had a fiberglass bed cap with a dome light at well) on an air mattress right before it got to us. 

That storm made that truck roll side to side in a way that was scary, especially considering my father and myself at that time combined for like 400lbs( I was 5'10-11"" and 200lbs, he was 6'3"" and same weight, lol).  The lightning was going off everywhere and the wind was howling across the desert. It was terrifying at the time for me(my dad fell asleep, he was a champion sleeper).

 After eventually falling asleep I woke up around dawn with my father and we got out to find about a half inch of water on the desert floor. Needless to say that a hike into the canyon wasn't going to happen that day, forcing us to pack up and leave back to San Antonio. At least the wildflowers that morning were absolutely stunning. 

  
Rainbow In the Dark was one of the songs that played that night and for whatever reason hearing that song while watching those tall clouds lighting up Mexico as it rolled towards us galvanized the me of that night.

  
The melancholy feeling it now evokes is because my father passed about 13 years ago and it is a core memory I have of him, it was a pleasant trip full of hope, terror, disappointment, and beauty. All in two days.",2025-04-05 06:41:10,1,doom32x,music

I felt similarly for a few years, still listened to a lot of stuff of varied genres. Some was definitely good and what I should like. But it didn't scratch an itch, I didn't connect. 


I still threw all this stuff on playlists which seemed to make things worse where it felt like I was encountering stuff I should like but felt was mediocre.

mkiknia,1jnbbk0,reddit,"There is a lot of recent ""recommended"" music that I hear about and that I listen to that I found *interesting*, but does not overwhelm me. Either I like a few songs, or I don't really enjoy listening to it regularly.

One example of this is Ado, very talented singer from Japan, some amazing songs and vocal performance, but others that are ""standard j-pop"" and don't feel that interesting.

But on the other side, there are bands that I found out recently and that I really fell in love with:

\- The Warning: trio of young sisters from Mexico that are doing a unique twist of hard rock

\- ZUTOMAYO: Japanese pop/funk/rock band (at their concerts, there are something like 20 people on stage) led by female singer/songwriter ACAne

These bands are not in the style I'm generally listening to, which is more jazz/fusion and electronic music. But the common element (that works for me) is that they are fantastic on stage and they work on musicianship as much as the vocal performance.

Pay me my money down by Bruce Springsteen. What was that? Why is he playing new orleans music, why is he having so much fun but most importantly, why was this ear worm so fucking good.

And that was that, Bruce is now the face of my YouTube algorithm. His live shows are incredible and probably most importantly, his voice is aging so well. Even the newest stuff he does blows my mind. I'm a fan waiting on the edge of his seat for new music from a 75 year old.

Maybe it was because I was older, but the musical arrangements just resonated and instantly was a fan of Andy and Johnny Marr’s work.  Still could do without Morrissey, but Johnny still plays the songs on tour and does the singing himself or guest performs with other bands.

The solos imo are some of the best solos in all of metal. Theres not a pretty melody to be heard. Every second of soloing is completely blistering. It almost reminds me of free jazz.

mo8rif9,1k3w014,reddit,"Why not gigs rather than clubs? 

Clubs tend to be groups of friends dancing together which will make you feel like you are sticking out more. 

A gig on the other hand everyone faces the front. People next to you will just assume you are with the people on the other side of you. Much easier to blend in and avoid being self conscious. If you start to get paranoid that the people around you have rumbled you... just move somewhere else in the crowd. 

Also I think it's generally considered more normal to solo gig. I know people with lots of friends who do it.

If you want to dance to club music there are plenty of big acts that do more gig style shows rather than club nights.

Going to from your posts here in going to assume you're a bit of a introverted nerd. If that's the case can I recommend getting you tickets for Flying Lotus? Seeing him play top a festival and the biggest reactions from the crowd being for stuff like the Final Fantasy 7 victory theme mixed into the Ghost In The Shell opening... genuinely the most ""i belong here"" moment of my life.

If you go enough, you will find people who keep coming back into your life eventually. You'll form a circle if you're a regular. Find a spot that most suits your interests and start showing up before it gets full. Get there early and chill out at the bar or at a table and just hang out. People will be interested in talking to you most likely the first night. I am in a similar situation. I don't have friends where I'm living now, and I don't have family because the older generation has passed away. All of them. My kids are grown and live in three different states. None in the same state where I am. I play guitar and am finally getting the feeling that I should start showing up at places where they have open mic and other live music. So I will go alone. And I have faith that I will find my circle in one of those places. I believe you can also at the dance clubs.

Pink floyd; dark side of the moon (only money and on the run dont get me to cry but man eclipse, brain damage, time, us n them, colors…), wish you were here, comfortably numb

[Arctic Outpost AM 1270 ](https://radio.garden/listen/arctic-outpost-am-1270/sl0laSBK)in Longyearbyen, Norway - Awesome collection of 78's and 45's, mostly swing and blues, but fairly eclectic within the timeframe remit.    

[British Home Front Radio ](https://radio.garden/listen/the-british-home-front-radio-service/x83mXMQd)in Doncaster UK - Not really pre-war, more trying to recreate a wartime radio station. Also has ads, announcements, and radio show snippets of the war era.     

[Radio Dismuke ](https://radio.garden/listen/radiodismuke/uWLxn4lU)in Fort Worth, TX - Lots of fun-time stuff, tends to be boppy and more upbeat than these others.   

[WLVN 1940's Radio ](https://radio.garden/listen/wlvn-1940s-radio/iBoBAi4E)in Livingston, MT - Focuses on that decade, does a lot more country than the other stations, also has contemporary ads and drops sometimes.   

[KBRD Radio AM 680](https://radio.garden/listen/kbrd/Js0JMaWZ) in Olympia, WA - At night they have mellow swing era music, daytime they do lots of old radio plays like Yours Truly Johnny Dollar, Suspense, or The Shadow. Sometimes they just have modern music as they are a normal community radio station.   

[KTQA-LP 95.3 FM](https://radio.garden/listen/ktqa-lp-95-3-fm/V_bJCXf9) in Tacoma, WA- Also mostly old-timey radio plays, some community radio stuff too. Rarely but sometimes does straight old timey music programming.    

  
Ok, hope that fills some holes for your listening pleasure. These are basically in order of my preference. I just have these in a block of my favorites on Radio garden, so if I feel like some old-timey stuff I'll put on Arctic Outpost and if they're not satisfying the itch I'll go through the list until something does.",2025-04-23 05:50:41,26,byOlaf,music

He uploaded over 2,300 old folk 78s over the course of eleven years.  These are not original 78 transfers, as he posted the music that he had that he thought others would enjoy.  The channel does not go as in-depth as the ones you mentioned but it is a good resource for fans of Harry Smith-type stuff.

Is a tiny prayer to father time

As I stared at my shoes

In the ICU

That reeked of piss and 409

And I rationed my breaths

As I said to myself

That I'd already taken too much today

As each descending peak

On the LCD

Took you a little farther away from me

Away from me

Amongst the vending machines

And year old magazines

In a place where we only say goodbye

It stung like a violent wind

That our memories depend

On a faulty camera in our minds

And I knew that you were truth

I would rather lose

Than to have never lain beside at all

And I looked around

At all the eyes on the ground

As the TV entertained itself

'Cause there's no comfort in the waiting room

Just nervous paces bracing for bad news

And then the nurse comes round

And everyone lifts their heads

But I'm thinking of what Sarah said

I stepped into an avalanche

You strike my side by accident

Your laws do not compel me now  
To kneel grotesque and bare  
I, myself, am the pedestal  
For this ugly hump at which you stare

You who wish to conquer pain  
You must learn what makes me kind  
The crumbs of love that you offer me  
Are the crumbs I’ve left behind

It’s just a shadow of my wound

I have begun to long for you

Know I am proud of the steps that you've made

Know it will never be easy or simple

Know I will dig in my claws when you stray

So let us rest here like we used to

In a line of late afternoon sun

Let it rest, all you can't change

Let it rest and be done

I still think *22, a Million* is his most striking album, and I love the widescreen, pastoral vibe of his s/t, but this one just feels cozy in the way that I need right now. On the first few listens, there aren’t any real show stoppers on the level Holocene or 33 “God” (or 666 upsidedowncross, or 8(circle) or pretty much any other song on that album or even a “Hey, Ma” or “Faith”), but it’s got a fantastic vibe.

Personally, I'm an absolutely massive Bon Iver fan, and I think this is his weakest album yet. There's still some magic for sure but I think it has the least going on sonically and conceptually. Maybe it's a product of his working with a lot of straightforward pop artists in recent years. Or maybe he's just already explored the extents of his artistic voice, because this album feels like trying to find new spins on sounds he's already dabbled in whereas the tetralogy (and particularly the first three albums from it) felt like he kept venturing into exciting uncharted artistic territory compared to what we'd heard from him previously.",2025-04-12 21:46:06,-5,youngbingbong,music

The Velvet Underground & Nico, didn't enjoy it before listening to their third album, now my favorite band ever

loveless - my bloody valentine, thought it was just bunch of random noise thrown in together, after developing an obsession with shoegaze, (Blue Rev - Alvvays and To See the Next Part of the Dream - Parannoul was all I was listening to) I finally realized it was genius and it's now in my top 10 albums ever

Unknown Pleasures - Joy Division, thought it was boring at first and only liked Disorder from it, I don't know what changed within me but I love it now, I hope the same thing happens with Closer

For the First Time - Black Country, New Road, absolutely loved Ants From Up There, and got disappointed that their debut album was very far from Ants, after a while, I learned to appreciate Sunglasses then the whole album

I was working @ a record store when it was released. The whole staff reacted as if it was one of the greatest albums ever whereas I thought it was eh, ok, I guess… - as my tastes (at the time) leaned more into goth/EBM/industrial.

Fast forward to a couple weeks later, I was mildly stoned while driving a convertible with the top down on Lake Shore Drive @ 1am when the title song came on the radio - & for whatever combination of reasons it just clicked with me. Picked up the album next day & really gave it a serious listen.

Another album is Cocteau Twins' Heaven Or Las Vegas. That also took three to four listens before I started to really appreciate it.

Frontman Robert Smith repeatedly clarifies that the lyrics are purely literary, but misinterpretations force the band to issue disclaimers and alter lyrics in later performances.

mnbfcho,1jzxpre,reddit,"I like one person's response that it *is* real life - that it introduces something additional to real life rather than replacing it with something less real.

I like this because music makes me feel distinctly alive, so it's less like hiding from life and more like embracing more welcome experiences.

One way I might describe it as helping me ""escape real life"" is the time transporting element. Something I spoke about a lot last year was my chronological 20th century dive—1901-1999 Jan-December, listening exclusively to music of each decade as the months progressed.

I feel it even more looking back now at the previous year, but man there was an escapism to being, musically at least, in the 40s in March, and having the music of that era (and the preceding decades) being all that existed. I can listen to music of this time period now and still be moved, but nothing matches that experience.

It ceases to be novelty or curiosity, and you tailor music to moods very differently than you would in the 'modern' era of, say, 1967 onwards, certainly 70s/80s onwards where you can immerse yourself in dark ambient sounds if you please. 

Even thinking back to the more recent months, like the 80s/90s at the end of the year, it feels so different. I was living life in the present day, but half of me was permanently transported. I can't speak to anybody who can relate to this. Nobody. 

God I've felt so adrift this year with all that behind me. It's like finishing your favourite film and feeling like you've awoken from a wonderful dream. But it's still, still life. I can't separate any of my time in 2024 from the music that accompanied it - so it's less escaping and more enhancing real life.",2025-04-15 23:03:00,1,RiC_David,music

Released in 1964, when The Rolling Stones was singing “It’s All Over Now” and The Beatles released “Eight Days A Week”, The Kinks had this rough and ready track, part grunge/garage rock, part punk…and STILL a banger SIXTY YEARS LATER!! A testament to its status in the pantheon of forever rock!
