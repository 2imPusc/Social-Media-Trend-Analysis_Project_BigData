gaming,1k4q0av,"What are some games that would be better WITHOUT experience and level systems? (excluding Battle passes, account levels, and other player retention BS)","RPG style level-up systems often get alot of praise for being a really easy way to add a sense of progression to a game but I think there's plenty of times where they actively hinder the experience, and it be better without them.

Again, this is **NOT** referring to Battle passes, or account levels that just artificially board you from content so you're forced to grind.  This stuff is done for ""player retention"" metrics so they're tacked on because of corporate reasoning.  I want to hear games where the devs put in levels so you can unlock new skills or raise your stats, but it would've been better if those levels weren't there at all.

For example, in Street Fighter 6's world tour mode, your created character having a level actually makes it harder to gather dyes from random enemies, since they often require you hitting them with certain attacks, and they can easily DIE before you reach the goal needed to get the item you need.  

Another example is Sonic and the Secret Rings which has an EXP and Level system where you can equip more abilities as you complete levels.  However, every ability is either useless, should be standard, or in some rare cases, actually hinder your ability to control Sonic (primarily with homing attack lock-on range during enemy hunt missions, and whatever's making me overshoot rails when I try to jump off them).

gaming,1jyntup,"The struggle is real: modern gaming woes, what's been your biggest issue lately?","Hey fellow gamers, I wanted to start a discussion about the real struggles we all face in modern gaming. Whether it's technical issues, microtransactions, or just trying to find time to game in our busy lives, it seems like we all deal with something. Here are a few things I’ve been dealing with lately:

1.Endless Updates: You finally get some time to play, but then your game needs a huge update that takes hours to download. You’re just sitting there waiting while everyone else is playing. Not fun.

e.g. Call of Duty (any recent title)

Every time a new update drops, it feels like you're downloading an entire new game. You boot up for a quick match, and boom 120GB update. Game night = postponed.

2.Microtransactions and Pay2Win Mechanics: I don’t mind buying cosmetics, but when a game’s progression feels locked behind paywalls, it gets frustrating. Especially when it impacts the gameplay experience.

e.g. NBA 2K series

This franchise is notorious for pushing microtransactions in MyCareer mode. If you don’t spend money on VC, your player feels useless online for a long time. And it’s not a quick grind.

3.Servers and Connectivity: Getting dropped from a multiplayer match because of server issues, especially right before you’re about to win, is just the worst. It's like the universe conspires against your victories.

e.g. Battlefield 2042 (launch period)

At launch, the server issues were so bad that players were being disconnected constantly. And even when you got in, bugs were everywhere. It’s gotten better, but that launch period was brutal.

4.Toxic Communities: Some online communities just aren't fun anymore. There's nothing like the stress of getting yelled at for ""being bad"" in a casual game, or dealing with trolls in every match.

e.g. League of Legends

Even people who love the game admit it can be incredibly toxic, especially for newer players. The learning curve+pressure+trash talk=not always a good time.

5. Game Lengths: I don’t know about you, but sometimes I just want a good game that I can finish in a few hours without feeling like I’m being dragged through hours of filler content.

e.g. Assassin’s Creed Valhalla

Great game, beautiful world but there’s so much to do. Side quests, collectibles, upgrades, minigames… it can start feeling like a second job rather than fun.

Above mention problems I could think of 1 game that is good. Hades, no microtransactions. Tight gameplay. Polished and complete at launch. You can finish it in a reasonable amount of time, and it respects your time while being super replayable.

So what about you? What’s your biggest issue with modern gaming? Or do you have any clever solutions to combat these frustrations? Let’s talk about it.

I had all nintendo consoles until the N64 and then I was shifting to playstations always and mostly PC gaming. then I bought a SWITCH, i dunno why i skipped the rest, i think it was mostly due to the games i spend most time on the other systems and of course private life when growing up, but the SWITCH somehow was itching in my fingers and i felt some nostalgia and it was like having a 2nd birthday gift made for myself :) was such a great day having bought it with mario odyssey and zelda! felt so nostalgic and was never disappointed. i always wanted to play Metroid Prime (and of course more games like the zelda ones etc.) and was so happy to have gotten METROID PRIME last year, this moment was again very nostalgic for me, i even played it in my holidays and was sucked in and enjoyed nearly every minute! then i expected that NINTENDO would release the 2nd and 3rd before Metroid Prime 4..... 

I know I could get a Gamecube etc. but I really dunno why there is still at least no MP2 by now and i will wait to play MP4 until having played the other 2 games. also disappointed that Mario Galaxy 2 was still not released :(.

gaming,1jp6dyq,What's the best games adaptation of an anime?,"I was thinking today about how anime games usually skim over a lot of the story because they're made for people who have already seen every episode. Sparking Zero is great example, as it even removed an entire arc of the Super anime.

It makes sense that a potentially 100+ hour story would need to be trimmed, but it's unfortunate how often the result is a bastardized, truncated mimicry of the original writing.

So, I pose a question to r/gaming: what is the best anime adaptation of an *anime.* Specifically in regards to the story. Lots of anime spin off games capture the experience of the setting, mostly in regards to combat, so the question is specifically not asking what the most fun adaptation game is. 

As a bonus question, what spin off game has the best original story? It's not uncommon for anime spin off games to just come up with a whole new story, though the writing usually isn't very good. What games prove that wrong?",0,0.29,15,2025-04-01 20:46:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1jp6dyq/whats_the_best_games_adaptation_of_an_anime/,Hormo_The_Halfling

I do have a Steam Deck and love it, but games like No Man's Sky, Baldur's Gate 3, Civilization, Lies of P, etc work great on my Mac and it's nice to just sit at my desk and enjoy a little higher resolution than the SD. I've noticed that some games (GRID, Control) are now available on Mac, but only through the App store. I already own Control on Steam and I'm not going to buy it again, so I'm stuck. Apple is so far behind with gaming, why would they limit adoption? I understand profit motivation, but if it didn't work for Epic to push gamers to an alternate store, it won't work for Apple. I would think they'll make more money by working to make games work well for Mac and more universally available so they sell more hardware.

During that time in CSGO i could literally just cheat and the only thing I'd have to worry about is to not be blatant on the spectators so that they would not vote kick me, but VAC itself literally does nothing on my ass as it could only watch in horror as I hack ingame. The cheat I used in question was also free, and I don't spend money on such things. If I were to attempt the same thing in let's say, Valorant or Fortnite, I would get BANNED in an instant.

Now that with COD Warzone and Verdansk 2025 is out, and people are STILL CHEATING like haywire, I'm wondering if they should just go ham and do what Riot did with Vanguard, or if they should find other ways of cleaning the game up.

I believe (now on the fence about this) that it's still super effective against cheaters at the cost of privacy as well as excluding players such as on Linux (especially Steam Deck) and GeForce NOW (I'm the latter) due to it's intrusive nature.

gaming,1jyawe9,Open-World vs. Non-Linear,"Hi all!

Yesterday I hopped into a discussion on the direction of open-world games in the industry. What I see a lot of in the comments of that discussion are people using open-world and non-linear interchangeably. To me, these are not the same. However, it definitely depends on one’s definition of those two concepts.

As an example, I argued that Majora’s Mask is open-world, but someone else disagreed with it being considered a true open-world game.

Then there’s the linearity. Is an open-world game non-linear by definition? To me, it isn’t. An example is Marvel’s Spider-Man. Undeniably open-world, but very much a linear game, the way I see it.

Furthermore, is a non-linear game open-world by definition? I also say no to this. A game like The Walking Dead is non-linear to me. However, it’s certainly not open-world.

What are your definitions? How do you view these two genres as they relate to each other?

EDIT: Super cool to see the different perspectives. Something that’s abundantly clear so far is that my definition of linearity is a bit narrow. I like the idea of narrative linearity and level linearity. Something like The Walking Dead is (of course) linear in terms of level structure; you can’t choose when you want to progress the narrative. However, it’s non-linear in a narrative sense. On a separate note, to those of you trying to argue that open worlds have to be “large maps,” good luck to you. It seems there are lots of others that agree with you, but I certainly don’t.",0,0.42,65,2025-04-13 15:58:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1jyawe9/openworld_vs_nonlinear/,Bee892

But coming back to replay Bioshock 2 recently, I couldn't help but reassess my views. The game felt generally forced and contrived, almost like a caricature at times of the first, an obligatory sequel that somewhat tarnishes the legacy of a classic.

Here are some tips to be ready for online retail war!,"If you're planning to brave the Nintendo Switch 2 launch (despite the overpriced games), here are some tips to have the best chances of competing with the scalpers and other enthusiastic gamers like yourself!

1. Make sure you have yourself signed into all major retailers (Target, Walmart, Best Buy, Amazon, etc) on as many devices as safely possible. Utilize passkeys & biometrics where ever possible to minimize the amount of time it takes you to sign in.

2. Make sure you have your preferred payment method set up as **default** on those sites. 

3. Avoid payment methods, such as PayPal, that require you to be bounced back and forth between sites.  Remember, middle-man financial services like PayPal will be hammered as well.

4. Walmart tip: The site allows you to link a bank account for payments. If you're comfortable with that, it cuts out the need to connect to a credit card company to access your funds.

5. Obviously, get yourself signed into *all* the retail sites you want to try on all devices. It might be worth it to have WiFi turned off on at least one of your mobile devices because many sites handle network traffic from cellular differently than over normal TCP/IP. Those channels might be a bit less bogged down.

gaming,1joanc0,"For competitive fps gaming, does physical distance from your screen matter at all or just field of view?","What i'm asking is, is there an advantage to being on a small screen and sitting very close over a large tv farther away?


Trying decide whether to get the 83"" S85D ($1800 at av dudes) or the higher quality 77"" S90D ($2200 most places). S90D is a QD-Oled that is brighter (room does get a bit bright for my 11 year old 300 nit LG a few hours out of the day), has better colors, and 144Hz instead of 120Hz. I think if i get the 77"", i will be slightly too far away on my couch and will end up switching input to a smaller, older screen i will have next to it for when i need a desk for rts type games. I think the 83"" will be big enough not to feel the need to do this unless there is some type of inherent advantage of being closer regardless of field of view. Obviously, I will feel it if it exists. I'm going to be doing just ps5 for everything but Age of Empires (which i will play on the smaller screen with the desk) until there is a graphics card that can do 4k60 with raytracing for a price that doesn't want to make me puke. My gtx 970 is good enough for age of empires, and i don't feel anything short of 4k60 with raytracing will be a big enough upgrade over ps5 to be worth the upgrade. Is the 144Hz worthwhile over 120Hz for pc gaming? I have heard you should have at least 60 base frames to get a good experience with frame gen. Nothing is going to run at exactly 60, so 65 or 70 would result in going above the refresh rate if it is 120. Will this cause tearing or does that only happen when the fps is below the refresh rate of a screen that does not have VRR?

In a time where making games has never been more simple and accessible, literally everyone can create high quality games with free software and no programming knowledge.   
A time where Gaming is the largest and most profitable entertainment industry with the largest consumer base which is growing year by year.   
A time in which distributing video games is simpler and cheaper than ever.  
A time where some of the most popular video games have been made by one person or a small group of developers, putting AAA games to shame.  
  
It's all gaslighting by the big corporations that it couldn't be helped... inflation... costs going up... and so many other excuses.  
People need to realise that it's not the consumers problem when companies decide to spend millions on a polished turd and seem to be happy with creating aggressively mediocre games and then complain when people don't buy them.

They're playing the victim while making the consumer out to be the bad guy.

gaming,1juiifl,The volatility of one's online game account is saddening.,"Ubisoft, Microsoft accounts hacked and their support was extremely unhelpful, and flatout denied to do anything despite me collecting evidence all the way back from 2019.   
  
I had my Ubisoft, Microsoft, EA and Epic hacked in Feb while I was asleep and my PC was off. Woke up next morning, noticed my google account hacked and fixed it. Noticed that my Epic and EA were hacked right away (the Ubi and MS emails must've gone to Spam), and I got my account back in 30 minutes (despite the hacker having changed out the login e-mail ID).

I noticed my Ubi and MS account being gone in March. Oh-shit moment followed by a quick trip to their respective supports and opening a case. 10 days later, I had responses from both of them - Ubisoft somehow managed to verify my account, and then proceeded to NOT be able to verify my account and then decline the account recovery process. Microsoft also declined the recovery for similar bullshit reasons, both stating ""account security"", yada yada yada and whatnot.

  
I have purchased a couple of games in both the accounts, from my memory I've spent 60$ on each account totally in the games and DLC for them. I had a few thousand hours totally in each account playing Rainbow Six Siege, Crew 2, Breakpoint and on the MS side a ton of hours in Forza Horizon 4, some in minecraft and a few in Horizon 5. I have no CDs purchased to provide keys for (since I bought my PC in 2019 when CDs were more or less extinct). 2FA was enabled by email for all my accounts except the EA account. Launching Rainbow Six from my linked Steam account opens a login page for the Ubisoft launcher and doesn't log in to the account or launch the game.

  
Now, thankfully my Steam was untouched (which is where most of my games reside, and hooray for Steam Guard) but it still pains me to lose all these hours and games. What pains me more is the callousness of the support - they state vague reasons, refuse to explain everything and most of the times spew what looks like automated AI responses, which is HUGELY discouraging as a customer that has spent money on them (and can potentially spend money again on them if the support is good). 

It once again reinforces the idea that we don't own anything, anybody can take anything from you and support can take the hacker's side and be unhelpful - resulting in one losing things in the blink of an eye. Makes me less hopeful for the future of gaming, as things get more digital.

I personally think Gaming is the best value for entertainment when you consider how many hours (20 hrs on the low end of the average time per game) you get out of a game versus going to the movies (~2 hours, $15) or lunch/dinner (2 hours, $20).

What do you think fair value for new games is?

To give ideas on structuring replies, consider the following types of games:

AAA Singleplayer
AAA multiplayer 
AAA live service
AA releases
Indie Games
Early Access
Remasters
Reboots

gaming,1jk204g,How do I get my foot into the Gaming industry as a career?,"Hey, Gamers! A fellow gamer here! I've been gaming since I was 4 years old. Some of the first ever games I played were Zelda: A Link to the past, Sonic the Hedgehog, and Donkey Kong Country. It's been a passion/hobby of mine my entire life. I love everything about it and can't get enough. Loved growing up with video games and being there alongside them as they advanced in technology year after year. From playing my Gameboy Color under the street lights on my rides home to now being fully immersed in a VR experience. It's been a wild ride.

I've been in the restaurant business for about 15 years now. From a little busser that was too shy to ask if you're done with your plate, to a bartender that can keep up with the wittiest of people. I fell into the job and can't complain. I enjoy what I do. It pays the bills and then some. Like I said though, it's a job and I enjoy it. Although, I'd much rather a career that I love! I'm getting older now and I'm starting to feel it. Long nights, on my feet all day, shaking drinks, carrying kegs, trying to cater to 20 different personalities at a time. It's a lot, physically and mentally.

I so badly want to get into a career with the gaming industry. I want to be apart of it all. I just don't know where to start. I took a game design class in High School which was super cool that my school had that available, but I didn't stick with it enough to take that into a job. I can be artistic and creative. I'm a good doodler, cartoonist, caricature artist. But I'm not sure if I'm good enough to rough draft designs. I have a good voice, I can mimic well and come up with my own silly and serious voices. I'd love to be a voice actor for some characters! I also thought about maybe being a video game tester just to get my foot in the door.

I know the industry is hurting a lot lately. I've heard of a bunch of lay offs in many studios. But in my mind that just means when things ramp up again there should be plenty of open positions.

So please, Folks. Lend me a hand. Give me ideas. Point me in the right direction. I want this so badly. I want gaming to be my career!

The games we're playing right now are ultimate chicken horse, rounds and Risk of rain 2. For example in ror2 which is supposed to be a coop game everything he cares about is having a bigger damage stat at the end of the game, even if it means stealing items from me, or like in rounds he plays every time the most broken build imaginable and he still loses from a random ass build i make which is really fun to use. We tried games like cuphead, minecraft or keep talking and nobody explodes but he just finds them boring so we've run out of games to play. Ngl im starting to become really competitive as well and i find it extremely entertaining destroying him in a game when he gives it his best hahah if you could drop some names, preferably indie or medium sized games(we're not fans of big games like cs2 RL or LoL) it would be awesome, since we already have tens of hours in the games i've mentioned and they're getting a bit stale, thanks ",0,0.31,28,2025-04-04 13:31:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1jrbyic/i_need_game_reccommendations_for_my_annoying/,JustAlex426

Duty sees the zone as something that needs to be destroyed, and when you got shit like whirligig anomalies which throw you in the air and rip you apart, you can see where they're coming from. there's the Ecologists that are just scientists that want to study and research the zone, and given how flesh (a mutant pig thing) can smell through their eyes you can see why they have an interest in it being around. 

then there's games like New Vegas where the main factions are: a rich guy in carbonite, a robot that is incapable of saying ""no"", a weak government that is so thinly stretched it could break any moment, and some weirdos in football pads that are led by a guy with a brain tumor who declared himself Caesar after he read a book and is making the same mistakes of Roman Empire by stretching way too thin.
