music,1k3uveo,How much money is Tom Petty's music is generating these days? His radio presence is insane.,"Not complaining, I like Tom Petty. 


Don't listen to the radio that often, usually stream, but there are 4 radio stations I listen to and my car always starts the radio before it connects to my phone. 


Two of the radio stations are ""classic rock"" one is ""oldies"" (The Temptations used to dominate that channel) and one is ""variety"". They all play Tom Petty regularly and it seems like his music is ~15% of what is played on the radio. Guns N Roses also gets played a lot on all the stations too, but not quite as often. 


Was out of town this weekend and heard half a dozen Petty songs in the car on the out of town channels. 



I guess it's because he fits a lot of genres, classic rock, oldies now but not super old, I consider it folk, also could be ""easy listening""? I don't know. Radio is falling out but his music must be generating a crazy amount of money, you'd think he's the most beloved musician in history based on the radio.",276,0.87,121,2025-04-20 19:48:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1k3uveo/how_much_money_is_tom_pettys_music_is_generating/,ImOnTheBus

The shear emotion in Shane MacGowan’s voice, the depressing epic story, the uplifting music behind it, everything about it makes me cry every single time. For those who don’t know, it’s about a young Australian man going to war in Gallipoli during WWI and the horrors he experiences to his comrades and himself. It also vaguely explores his life back home after the war, too, as he utters my favorite lines:

“And now every April I sit on my porch
And I watch the parade pass before me.
I see my old comrades, how proudly they march
Reliving their dreams of past glory.

I see the old men, all twisted and torn
The forgotten heroes of a forgotten war
And the young people ask me, ""what are they
Marching for?""
And I ask myself the same question.

And the band plays Waltzing Matilda
And the old men still answer to the call
But year after year their numbers get fewer
Some day no one will march there at all.”

Tom Morello performing with Kaiser Permanente Therapists on strike today in Los Angeles.  -My wife is a therapist at Kaiser, and they have been on strike for Six Months! All the therapists want are the same benefits offered to the Northern California Therapists! More info in comments

**Some background info on the strike**

Nearly 2,400 mental health workers at Kaiser Permanente in Southern California have been on strike for almost six months now, fighting for better patient care, fair working conditions, and benefits equal to their Northern California counterparts.

The strike has reached the six-month mark, with workers continuing to hold strong despite significant financial struggles. Some therapists have even resorted to donating plasma to make ends meet while remaining committed to their cause. [Sandiegouniontribune](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/03/25/strike-by-kaiser-mental-health-workers-nears-the-six-month-mark/)

**What are they fighting for?**

The striking therapists, social workers, psychiatric nurses and psychologists are demanding the same guaranteed seven hours per week that Northern California Kaiser therapists receive for critical patient care duties, pension benefits that Kaiser eliminated for Southern California mental health professionals hired after 2014, and fair wage increases. [Nuhw](https://home.nuhw.org/2025/01/17/press-release-kaiser-permanente-refuses-to-offer-new-proposals-during-bargaining-thursday-as-mental-health-strike-in-southern-california-approaches-third-month/)

Back in 2022, a 10-week strike by mental health workers in Northern California ended with Kaiser agreeing to provide more time for patient care duties and increased staffing. Now, Southern California workers want those same gains, with State Senator Maria Elena Durazo supporting their cause, saying ""These workers are saying, 'Hey, wait a minute. You do this in Northern California. How about the people in Southern California?'"" [KPBS Public Media](https://www.kpbs.org/news/health/2024/10/21/kaiser-mental-health-workers-strike-southern-california-over-staffing-workloads)

The human impact has been significant. Patients who depend on these services have been left without their regular therapists, with some being offered outsourced access to therapists through online services. This has created anxiety and uncertainty for vulnerable patients already struggling with mental health issues. [CalMatters](https://calmatters.org/health/2024/12/kaiser-strike-mental-health-southern-california/)

Some patients have reported being ""hot potato-ed"" between different therapists without any continuity of care, leaving them frustrated and without the consistent treatment they need. [Courthousenews](https://www.courthousenews.com/southern-california-mental-health-patients-speak-out-during-health-care-worker-strike/)

Recently, in a powerful escalation of their protest tactics, striking therapists began a five-day hunger strike in early April outside Kaiser's Los Angeles Medical Center to highlight Kaiser's failures to address patient needs. [Nuhw](https://home.nuhw.org/2025/04/04/kaiser-mental-health-professionals-launch-l-a-hunger-strike/)

Today, the picket line in Los Angeles got a major boost when Tom Morello from Rage Against the Machine joined the striking workers to show his support. I was there personally and saw how his presence energized the crowd and brought more attention to their fight.

Morello joining today's action follows his long history of supporting labor movements. He has previously shown up for striking workers, like when he played a surprise set on a Hollywood picket line for SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikers, saying ""I'm here to support them and express my solidarity."" [NME](https://www.nme.com/news/music/tom-morello-plays-surprise-show-on-hollywood-picket-line-im-here-to-support-them-and-express-my-solidarity-3483070)

The strike continues with no clear end in sight. Mediation talks were prepared to begin as early as February 17, but the strike has clearly continued well beyond that point. [KPBS Public Media](https://www.kpbs.org/news/health/2025/02/07/kaiser-mental-health-workers-prepare-for-mediation-after-four-month-strike)

If you're in Southern California, consider stopping by a picket line to show support. These workers are fighting not just for themselves but for better mental health care for everyone.

If you youre inclinded to help the therapists continue their strike you can do so here - [https://nuhw.org/kaiserhardshipfund/](https://nuhw.org/kaiserhardshipfund/)

This is sort of a psa to say that seeking out and listening to independent music is very time consuming, yet rewarding too, but I want to caution lazy and/or AI cover art. 

I do judge the search results by their cover art, it’s really all we have to go by when sifting through dozens of independent albums each day. AI artwork is almost a guaranteed pass on a curator listening to your art.  Lazy cover art is another big issue I’m finding on bandcamp. If you don’t care, why should a potential new fan care?

music,1k4v86l,Do a lot of people stop listening to new music after high school?,"My inquiring mind wants to know, is this like a thing that a serious number of people do? If so, what are your thoughts on why this happens? 

I didn’t even know who I really was at 18, and had yet to experience most of the “real world” heartbreak and struggles that would shape a lot of the music I was drawn to and embraced throughout my life. 

Don’t get me wrong, I will stand by NIN’s Downward Spiral/Oasis’s What’s the Story Morning Glory/Radiohead’s Ok Computer til I die. But if that had been the peak of my new music discovery and appreciation, I would have lived a much less fulfilling life creatively, for sure. And I would have been exposed to so many less women and non-white and queer artists. This literally pains me to think about as a musician. 

I would have never had learned about Beach House or Janelle Monae or St Vincent or The Knife 🤯

How can music move forward and progress and evolve faster than a crawl if people stop consuming new artists’ music at 18? Where would we be right now if a large percentage of today’s adults’ new music-listening peaked at Blink-182? 

Oh shit. That would actually explain a lot.

I'm from the generation that'd find music by watching MTV or going to The Wall and listening to samples on a scanned CD with those greasy headphones. 

If it matters, I'm a big fan of alternative, midwest emo (I think that's what it's called, think Hawthorne Heights), rap (I'm pretty selective here), and some rap-adjacent techno-ish stuff like Freddie Dredd? Idk. Kinda lost.

Not really sure where to go to find new music :(",112,0.9,175,2025-04-21 14:25:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1k4et96/where_can_an_old_guy_keep_up_with_current_music/,asahdude13

Edit 2 - My mom said no sadly, my dad doesnt like concerts, my sister doesnt have enough vacation time, and my brother said he would depending on how long he would be in the state i live in now. my mom is reasonably scared on how other people would act, i did ask my friend he also said he would (he also likes the warning never knew) but he will be out of state during that time. i was thinking about stuff that could happen + me being a girl it would be best for someone to go with me. thank you again for your replies sad to say i prob wont be going unless my brother can stay here longer for his trip. ill for sure go the next time they come to usa!!

I'm no music expert, but I think it's a crazy diverse mix of sounds. Starting with a phased guitar chord, jumping to that simple four note riff, then charging into that hardcore distorted part over the verses which then tones down to a more subtle version of the same riff. There are more and it's all over the place. One of my favorite things about this song is how many different pieces it seems to be made of.

I’ve got tinnitus and my doc has recommended I wear earplugs whenever I go to concerts to avoid further damage.

I was looking into the Etymotic ER20s since they seem to be pretty popular, but I’ve read a lot of mixed reviews about them. Some people say they don’t let in enough sound, while others complain that they make the music sound flat and lifeless.

I’m also considering the Alpine MusicSafe Pro and Decibullz Custom Molded Earplugs.

Alpine seems to balance sound quality and protection pretty well, but I’m worried about how comfortable they are for longer shows.

The Decibullz ones are custom molded, which sounds great, but I’m not sure if they’ll affect the sound experience

music,1jpmcag,Songs with the best openings?,"What are some songs with great openings as per the title. I recently heard Curtis Mayfield's "" If there's a hell below we're all gonna go"" and the start of that song is so surreal. Another song that comes to mind is Praise God with Kanye but he's generally great with that sort of stuff like Runaway and Black Skinhead. Purple haze also has that killer palm muted  opening riff.

Any other examples? Can be from any genre, the more diverse the better.",71,0.89,342,2025-04-02 11:33:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1jpmcag/songs_with_the_best_openings/,Traditional_Garden40

music,1jsaxvy,Your 3 favorite debut albums of all time?,"Hard to pick just one so let’s talk about our 3 favorite debut albums of all time.  It’s interesting that when I think about many legendary bands (Beatles, Rolling Stones, The Who), their debuts are ok, but they are hardly great: there are a lot of covers on those albums and the originals are not quite up to snuff yet. 

But I have 3 that I think show close to a fully-formed band right out of the gate: The Cars, Van Halen and The Pretenders.  Whether one is a fan of these bands or not, I think most would agree that each band’s signature sounds are presented here as are some of each band’s very best songs.

music,1k49cah,Bros B4 Hoes,Long story short a gay rap group called CockMasta Flex made an album called Bros B4 Hoes many years ago. They only ever made 100 physical copies of it and the last ones I know of were sold about a year ago. If anyone has any idea where I can find one or some of the other one off merch sold it would be greatly appreciated. For context the other merch they made was a pair of timbs that say gay on the tongue owned by one of the members. There was also a cockstika (a swastika made of cocks) made by Thrust Bareback (one of the members).

music,1jmprdt,Greatest Second Half of any Album?,"There are a number of records which I adore that somehow have a questionably weaker first half compared to its latter finale of songs. Examples of this for me would be Random Access Memories by Daft Punk, OK Computer/Kid A by Radiohead, In the Mountain in the Cloud by Portgual. The Man, Laterlaus by Tool, Spiderland by Slint, To Be Kind by Swans and Sound of Silver by LCD Soundsystem. 

HOWEVER, in my very honest opinion, there are TWO albums which I feel enter into the realms of perfection past the first half.

1. Siamese Dream by The Smashing Pumpkins (1993) - from Soma onwards it becomes a flawless record. Such propulsive energy, the emotional dissonance of guitars and vocals in Mayonaise - this is cinematic rock music made with the largest ambitions and intentions. 

2. Remain in Light by Talking Heads (1980) - after an instrumentally very worldly opening to the record, the entire song slows down more dramatically after the hit single Once in a Lifetime. Eno’s influence is all over this (I could have put Bowie’s Low in this too) and the minimalistic, often mumbling Ulysses’s style train of thought thinking is peppered over Seen and Not Seen and then a complete full collapse of existential wonderment in the terrifying The Overload. Genuinely an album of stark contrasting halves, it’s the second half that impacts me more personally.

Anyways this is my first ever post, please help me if I’ve done anything wrong with the setting up of this discussion!

Strange one for me but its 'With Every Heartbeat' by Robyn. I had a horrible dream once where somebody I loved died and that song was playing in the dream as it happened. Now that song absolutely terrifies me. I feel like it haunts me. It's so strange but has anybody else had anything like this?

Edit: just remembered another one. 'Vidrar Vel Til Loftarasa' by Sigur Ros. One of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard but it just feels me with instant sadness even though it's gorgeous.
