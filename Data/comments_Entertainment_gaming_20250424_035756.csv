gaming,1jocrk8,mkqu2oc,The mystery of the monolith only gets more interesting as the series goes on. The alternate ending spills the beans on what it really is and Call of Pripyat shows what the zone is like without it.

gaming,1jocrk8,mkt6vwq,"I heard SoC was good but at the time Call of Pripyat was out. Gawd daaaaamn I love that game. I did try Chernobyl after but couldn't get into it for some reason. I have access to STALKER 2 via XBGP but I'm waiting for patches/improvements.

Pripyat is what made me excited for Metro 2033 which then became one of my favorite game series'.

Also, FYI, there's an old movie, 1979's Stalker by Andrei Tarkovsky. I believe it was the inspiration for the game. It's incredibly good.",3,2025-04-01 05:04:48,SuperDabMan
gaming,1jocrk8,mkqwp4c,"Finally, someone mentioned it! I loved this game most out of the franchise (I didn't play S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2). 

This ending is the most common one for everyone who plays the game for the first time. It symbolizes the character's greed, which kills him, because under the curse he sees gold coins falling and killing him.  
  
We can see that in each ending, whenever a wish is fulfilled, it is fulfilled in an absurd or exaggerated way. In no case does the protagonist's desire to get something lead him to anything positive. 

  
In my personal opinion, the wish-granter punishes the character for wanting to use him for personal purposes. Or it doesn't want humans to try to change the world. Maybe people are just users, not those who can change something global or they're the ones that are supposed to build it without any help. So human is supposed to give, but not to receive. We can discuss this for a long time.

I may be slightly off-topic, but I really love this game and it left me feeling so cozy. I plan to play all the games again one day.",5,2025-03-31 20:34:51,ANT_games

Come up with a good car modification system that can translate to plastic minis, flesh out the world and I think you'd have a winner on your hands.

Get a bean bag or large floor cushion(s).

So long as the bed isn't one of those divan style beds you can store the bag/cushion under the bed when not needed.

Set yourself a strict sleeping regime were you stop gaming at least two hours before you have to sleep so your brain isn't being over stimulated.

gaming,1k202v5,mnqadre,"I don't know anything about your self control, or your situation. But if you are in a tough spot then even the best of wills can break. 

Do something to set yourself a timer or hard stop on the console/TV at night when you need to sleep. Maybe a smart plug that shuts off at X time every night, worst case. 

The worst thing that you can do is spiral down and just play games or watch TV late when you should sleep. You don't have the separation you'd usually have and hardships can make you slip and form bad habits. That's what past experience tells me. Some people do ok with a TV in the bedroom, I'm not one of them and it's best to err on the side of caution imo. 

In terms of comfort, a hard pillow to prop yourself sitting up, a wall mount, and honestly maybe a pair of headphones instead of a sound system would be the way to go.",1,2025-04-18 09:01:42,HeliumIsotope

Mario Kart World isn't for us. It's for kids who haven't played Mario Kart or have only played MK8. Sure, they mix up the formula somewhat but it's all just Mario Kart. Same thing with Zelda, Call of Duty, and most other series of games.

Even things that aren't series still feel kinda samey when compared to other stuff. I've played WoW and FF14 so all other MMOs just feel like more of the same. I've played 100s of shooters and they all start to feel the same.

What I look for from games now is a unique experience. My favorite games today are Wildermyth, Dwarf Fortress, and Void Bastards because I feel like I really haven't seen these kinds of games before.

The days she said “my husband is going to raid with yall”, it was actually him talking.

gaming,1jw0g9j,mmh54yf,"I was actually the cause of significant drama, which had real life repercussions.

When I was a kid, my friend was in RuneScape clan.  One day he let me know that his internet would be down for 2 weeks, and asked if I could let the clan leaders know.  I said sure I will.

The idea struck me to instead inform them of his death.  I got on their IRC chat channel and told them he’d been hit by a bus.

To my surprise, the clan members didn’t seem all that shocked by the news. They let me know that his marriage had recently broken down after he’d lost his job, and that he’d had to move from “the big house” to a smaller one.  The only problem with this response was that my friend had never had a job nor a girlfriend, and still lived with his mother. 

My friend had been in this clan for years. He was close with these people, and he’d been lying to them about his life the whole time. I even started to wonder if he was strategically setting himself to appear offline at hours when he should be at work.  It was a very uncomfortable feeling to have uncovered that my friend was capable of this kind of thing—funny coming from someone like me, I know.

I ended up presiding over my friend’s RuneScape funeral, where we all listened to several of my favorite songs, including the full version of Bat Out of Hell.  I also arranged for his clan mates to donate items to me, which would be dropped over his RuneScape grave site.  Naturally, I kept them for myself.

Around a week later I logged into the IRC channel again to add more lore, but to my surprise I was kicked by my friend, whose internet had been restored earlier than anticipated. The last thing he ever said to me was, “Why you telling people I’m dead?”  I couldn’t bring myself to ask him why he’d been lying to his supposed friends for years.",46,2025-04-10 23:25:21,streetpatrolMC

gaming,1jty82m,mm3nfm5,"System Shock 2 and Deus Ex. Story wise these games can easily top any best written movie.

System Shock 2 with entire story and how it's delivered to the player via just observing things where ghosts of the past in your augments tell you what was happening, but also through one of the best narrated audio logs found across the space ship and some as text logs. Also amazing how certain characters evolve through the game, from protagonist as well as certain individuals and it really conveys the story to you in such interesting way. You really need to experience it and appreciate it that game of such caliber was released back in 1999. Remaster is coming up early this summer so anyone interested, try it out. System Shock 1 was remastered some time ago, also worth trying that one in more modern form. Absolutely worth it as well.

Deus Ex is a bit different, mostly with delivery of different outcomes to so many scenarios as well as interactions with NPC's talking to them, through your comms in the head and also through different logs found through world, quite similar to System Shock 2, partially since some of key people who worked on System Shock were working on Deus Ex too. With Deus Ex, story revolves more around ethics of human evolution and body modifications, transcendence and gods. It's old game now and feels a bit clunky, but it's actually very cinematic with very deep story.

I'd also put Dead Space here because of how similar it is to System Shock in its own way, also delivering very deep story and narration. Maybe it lacks the character of people you listen to unlike with System Shock 2 where you kinda really connect with the people you listen to through audio logs, especially their accents which were really wild. But it's there and it's conveyed to the player in cool way. It works.",2,2025-04-08 20:55:51,StaticSystemShock

AWD is statistically the fastest. it has higher acceleration, and the weight penalty is minimal in comparison. However RWD is more fun imo. it lets you kick the rear tires out easier and usually has less understeer compared to AWD. however the downsides are its harder to control, lower acceleration, and being basically useless offroad. FWD just kinda.. exists... its mainly designed for economy cars as its the lightest of the 3 drivetrains, and its downsides are only seen at racing speeds. however, forza is a racing game... so dont use it. its only in the game for accuracy's sake and i think only about 60ish cars in the entire game can use FWD out of 500+. FWD's main downsides are horrid amounts of understeer and the worst acceleration out of the 3 drivetrains. it does have the small upside of being better than RWD at offroad but pretty much any class B and up car will require AWD to be fast offroad anyways.",7,2025-04-22 02:27:34,Brett983
gaming,1k4v4tq,mod6106,"That's a very complex subject that depends a lot on the specific car, how it's set up, what the power levels are, and where the engine is. There are entire books dedicated to discussing various car setups and how to use them.

In very general terms, a classic race car is/was real wheel drive. When you accelerate, weight is transferred to the rear and this is a good thing for traction over your drive wheels. Separating power from steering helps with tire usage and traction as well, and because of how the weight works you can get a good front/weight rear ratio with the engine in the front, transmission down the middle, and a differential in the back.

Front wheel drive tends to be less than ideal for a fast car. When you accelerate, the weight shifts off the front wheels and thus reduces traction, which isn't ideal. Combining power and steering also reduces the effectiveness of it, and having the engine and transaxle up front tends to make them front-heavy.

However, FWD's main benefit from a driving standpoint is they tend to be easier to drive and recover from. If they understeer (push towards the outside of the corner), you can generally just steer a little more and give it power to pull out of it. If it starts to spin out, countersteer and power out of it and just goes. This makes it a little safer for passenger cars and a little more straightforward for newer race drivers.

Rear wheel drive is more versatile for handling - by balancing steering, throttle input, and just the right amount of weight balance a skilled driver can really control the car exactly how they want, and generally pull better times than an equivalent FWD car because of the weight transfer, traction, and general handling characteristics.

AWD, on the other hand, is kind of its own thing that, depending on the car and setup, can combine the best of both worlds. Most cars aren't fully 50/50 AWD though - some are rear biased split, some front split, some primarily FWD or RWD unless slip is detected, etc - lots of different varieties. In general though a good AWD system can combine the benefits of both by having rear wheel power for accelerating while having front power to steer and handle under braking in corners. This is why a lot of supercars and other high end sports cars tend to be AWD.

All of this is very highly variable and dependent on the car and driver skill of course. A very well tuned FWD car with a driver who knows how to handle is it going to turn some very good track times. A poorly balanced RWD car with a bad suspension setup is going to struggle in corners. Not all AWD systems are created equal. But those are the generalities. There are books like Going Faster by the Skip Barber racing school that gets into it some, and [even a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-sGV2XXUeU).

Edited to add: Forgot to mention mid and rear engine cars, like an MR2 or Porsche 911. These have all the advantages of a RWD car (weight and traction over the drive wheels) while also usually being rear weight balanced. This means with a skilled driver they can do some pretty fantastic handling by letting the rear end basically turn itself, but does mean they can do things like snap oversteer with improper throttle control. Adds a whole new dimension to everything.",9,2025-04-22 02:24:08,Scoth42
gaming,1k4v4tq,mod95ok,"My time to shine.

FWD has engine power being sent to the front wheels of the vehicle. The front wheels are also in charge of steering the vehicle and provide a majority of the braking force.

FWD cars have the most difficult time getting around corners because the front wheels are dealing with the forces of cornering and trying to put power down. These are just forces competing for priority, and they affect handling negatively. What can happen is something called ""understeer,"" where you turn and accelerate, but the car just pushes straight forward, even with the wheels fully turned.

High-powered FWD cars also can suffer from ""torque steer,"" which is when the power/torque from the engine forces the steering to turn towards a direction. What happens is you floor it, and the steering wheel will start turning in your hands to the right, and you'd have to fight that while driving quickly on a track.

RWD cars are considered the best layout because they don't suffer any of the things that FWD cars do. The front tires can just focus on braking and cornering. All the engines power is moved to the back wheels on the vehicle. The thing to watch out for is ""oversteer,"" which is the complete opposite of understeer. You turn the corner and accelerate hard, and the rear end can swing, causing you to spin out.

RWD was the standard layout until the 1970s when FWD cars became more popular.

AWD is a combination of the two. You can get understeer like a FWD car,  but it's a minor issue when you consider the substantially large benefit of all four wheels being powered. It offers a HUGE amount of grip and is incredibly stable in poor road conditions.

Will AWD/4WD make you invincible on roads with poor conditions? Absolutely not. You still need to be cautious in poor conditions, but it allows you to be more sure footed in it.

The difference between AWD and 4WD is that AWD is either full time or automatically switches between FWD/AWD without the ability to manually choose which you use. 4WD allows the driver to stay in 2WD mode until they manually switch it into 4WD, like on pickups.

gaming,1k2pjgy,mnxd96a,"Yeah so, for reasons I have a lot more time and want then my friends to play stuff and I’m tired of always playing stuff alone. So before I left for work I redid a room in my house and made it an office / streaming room. 
Spent stupid amount of money of new 5090 + 9800 combo, got lights and a green screen.

Trying to piece together some overlays and stuff and I want to do some funny shit like viewers being able to «flashbang» me w channel points of something (just make all lights in the room flash) also looking at which games I could play w viewers 

So I work in a 2 week on 4 week off rotation. For the upcoming 4 weeks off time, from Tuesday the 29th I’ll be full timing 4 weeks and see how it goes. The goal is really to have more social gaming experiences and make some friends along the way.

Anything beyond that would be a huge bonus 


Twitch having such a low bandwidth is kinda off putting but I think multi stream to yt also so if anyone wants 4K 60fps they can get it there. Twitch seems easier to build a community?

Games I like : Escape from Tarkov, Arma Reforger, Star Citizen, Valheim, silly stuff like REPO 


I usually go DEEP in every game I play

Edit; I guess more is better. Here is a few GTA vids I made some years back

I missed the last post or two, so let me keep you up to date on what I've been up to!\~   
  
I've been doing about 3 day streams a week, and a spontaneous night stream on the alternate when I'm feeling up to it! Most of them are long so come by and chat if you like Gaming content of any kind, music, and other types of media! 

  
There's two videos in the works/on hold right now for rivals until I have enough ""B Reel"" to be happy, so look out for those if you like Rivals!

I do not have a schedule, but I'm most often streaming between the late nights, to early mornings! Can't catch my stream? That's okay\~! I update the best of the best as shorts on my channel as they are edited!

Those games taught me what an RPG was and how they work. Before those, I thought they were just... weird wods and still enemies.

RPGs like final fantasy were just...walk around, something happens, and then enemies stare at you and you press buttons until the game ends. I could read the menues but I didn't understand what they meant. 

The secret of games were more Action RPGs but the fact you needed to utilize a menu, equip weapons and armor... it helped me figure out how navigating menus worked. How shops work, how classes work.

gaming,1jrru29,mlh63rr,"Knack for PS4

So as a note, I would rather be bored than frustrated.  Most people say the opposite; they'd rather be frustrated cause they 'at least feel something' but its such an unpleasant experience for me I'd rather be bored.  As a result, I'd rather play a boring game than a frustrating one.  Cause, I thought, if its boring then I can entertain myself or at least spend time analyzing or thinking about other stuff, or at the bare minimum, watch a video on the side to entertain myself.  I played Balan Wonderworld and I think that game at its worst is just boring (outside of the minigames/balan bouts) but I can genuinely see why some people would enjoy the game if you don't compare it to every other video game you've ever played in the past 20 years showing you what a good game is like.

So Knack, I was expecting it to be similar.  Very mediorce and plain, but had at least SOMETHING interesting to analyze, right?  Right?....no.  The game is so painfully by the numbers you can see every single decision the developer made as it happens on screen.  The story is lazy, the gameplay mechanics are basic and uninspired, and the game is nothing but a fancy way of showing how many loose particles they can have on screen.  Like I said, I can tolerate boring games, but this was *REALLY* pushing it.  In comparison, Balan was bad but all the things it got wrong were FASCINATINGLY wrong.  Like if you try to figure out why they made any decision in that game, you'll immediately become confused and have to piece it together like you're solving National treasure.  Knack?  No. The reason for every single decision is so plain and so obvious that there's nothing interesting in what he does right OR wrong.  Special moves are there as screen-clears for when you die too many times.  The villain is the villain cause he's the villain dont think about it.  The only really unique thing is the treasure chests that give you more options if you have more friends who've also played Knack, which is such a transparently BS tactic to try and buy the game for friends.  And even then, it takes too long to get any of the power-ups, including the ones that might actually change up the gameplay.  You might think the size/loose-particle things would be interesting but it's a bullet point on the box and nothing else.  Your size is so strictly controlled, it basically doesn't mean anything besides spectacle.  Katamari Demacy does that better.  Or any of those games where you eat things and grow bigger until you're eating the planet or whatever.",3,2025-04-05 01:54:07,Bladebrent

Regarding fighting games, I was very much a fan of Super Smash Bros, but not much else.

At some point I played Rakugakids on the N64, and because this game has a cute and silly cartoon aesthetic, it was the first fighting game I felt enamoured enough by to actually learn how to do inputs. I learned how standard fireball and shoryuken inputs work because I wanted to play Rakugakids.

Nowadays I can appreciate Street Fighter and other traditional-style fighting games, of course. I even enjoy games like 3rd Strike with their more technical mechanics, though of course I'm no good at them.

GTA 3 100% can be blocked accidentally if you do the missions in the wrong order. Paramedic also sucks and gangs become super dangerous once you leave an island so if you're going for 100%, do everything on one island before moving on

Vice City has better driving though Firefighter and Vigilante are harder. For Firefighter, sometimes people will run down small alleyways and you'll struggle to get to them. Vigilante I would do in either the tank or the hunter helicopter if you're struggling in the car. For ""Demolition Man"", you can kill everyone in the building with the helicopter blades before you pick up the bombs as the time doesn't start until you do

San Andreas is a pretty long game but not everything is required for 100% (the marathons, burglary, stunt jumps are all not required). I would do Burglary anyway to get unlimited sprint. Paramedic I would do in one of the small towns as it makes it go much faster. There is body armor under the bridge near grove street (since you don't unlock Ammunation for a while). ""Wrong Side of the Tracks"" needs you to drive a particular way from the train for Smoke to hit people (though you can just jump on and shoot them yourself).

*Spider-Man: Miles Morales* is the best game I've played that takes place at Christmas, but that's not exactly cozy and the plot has nothing to do with the holiday directly. It's more of a ""Die Hard is technically a Christmas movie"" thing. See also: *Batman Arkham Origins.*

I'm not sure if your rule against DLC is just about cosmetics, but I will say that Saints Row 4's DLC, *How the Saints Saved Christmas* is absolutely hilarious, and does add new maps, several missions, and new mini-games.

Sam & Max Beyond Time and Space starts with episode 201 *Ice Station Santa*, which is Christmas themed, but not really the type of game that holds up to repeated playthroughs.

Cave Story had a spin-off, *Cave Story's Secret Santa*, which is a stealth game. How cozy you find it may depend on how much you like the genre, but I found it stressful and gave up.

*Bridge to Another World: Secrets of the Nutcracker* is a decent hidden object / point and click adventure game. Like Sam & Max it probably won't hold up to repeated play, but it is enjoyable.",1,2025-03-25 18:58:41,figmentPez

Quizzically it can feel both cozy and unnerving at times, it's fantastic. There's a sequel too but the first game is definitely my favorite in the series. Don't spoil the story for yourself, go in blind! I'd highly recommend playing it this year!

Edit: I could probably recommend some other games with nice Christmas themes if you'd like but finding ones that are similar to Costume Quest is the hard part, I'm not sure I have any more that would fit that bill exactly.

gaming,1jtdxai,mlx1evm,"As a niche recommendation: The Last Remnant. It's union-based combat where you set up formations and then give each unit orders before the turn starts. The orders are generic, like ""Use physical attacks"" ""Stay back"" ""Flank them"" or ""Use healing"". Each character learns new skills over time (automatically) that you can also choose to deactivate if you don't like them or want them to fulfill a specific role.

The animations for this game are pretty flashy even today. The combat banter is fun too. It's a game where a lot of things happen in the background, like class determination, but the wiki has you covered if you want to go in-depth. Weapon and accessory upgrades are cool too. The plot is definitely not everyone's cup of tea, but I enjoyed it.

It's definitely a niche pick, but I think it might just be what you're looking for. Sadly, the OG PC version has been replaced by a visually inferior remaster unless you own a physical copy, but the game's the same. The optional bosses in some of the sidequests are insane too.

gaming,1jtdxai,mlws818,"Dragon Quest IV. I'm a fan of the NES original, but there's a DS remake with a more ""modern"" aesthetic. In the original, you play through a series of chapters controlling different groups of people throughout the setting. Eventually they come together and you control your party via loose guidelines such as ""offense"" or ""conserve MP."" It's a brilliant, beautiful game with one of the best soundtracks on the system. Yes it can be slow, yes it can be daunting, but overall it is paced very well and I consider it a top 35 videogame. The remake on DS controls normally by default but you can choose to control your party via commands as in the original. 


I've actually thought a lot about this particular concept and found a few games that feature conceptually, emotionally adjacent mechanical systems. 


If you haven't played an RTS, check out Pikmin. You don't fight enemies directly - instead, you must manage your Pikmin population and order them to attack for you. First game is about time management and exploration, second is a dungeon crawler. StarCraft is a game you control totally on your own, but I feel like it hits that bone in my body that wants to command an army and watch it mow down enemies. I prefer the first game and expansion. Nothing beats watching 200 zerglings swarm an enemy base. 


Dragons Dogma has comparable gameplay featuring a crew of AI-controlled companions. 


In Diablo II you can amass an army of skeletons or animals that do everything for you.

Deep character development and interaction. Story decisions seem as though they can effect later parts of the game and you are given some freedom in your path, though there is a linear path from area to area. Different zones are open world and beautiful, filled with places to explore.

Atomfall is also story driven, but it's very mysterious. Heavy focus on resource crafting, survival, and exploration. It doesn't hold your hand AT ALL, so be prepared to be frustrated if you need guiderails. It seems in my 15 or so hrs that you can complete the game many different ways and you are given almost ultimate freedom in your interactions with characters.

This is one of the few times when the gaming industry and government overlaps and, so it's irresponsible to want to shut it out. And, like it or not, it's probably going to a lot worse.

gaming,1jr4x9x,mlcmcp2,"Ever since the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct dropped the console and its games prices, I've been trying to collect some data on console and game prices over the years. I'm '97 born so things like the Sega Megadrive (Genesis for those in N. America), SNES, PS1, N64, Dreamcast are all ""before"" my time. 

The PS2 was my first ever console, it was released at £299 and iirc the standard game prices for the PS2 fell within the £30-50 range. I never personally owned a GameCube but I'm aware of the facts that it was a much cheaper console (£129-149) and that after heavy criticism for the N64's £60-70 price tag on games (and some even exceeding that for both the SNES and N64) Nintendo opted to shift to minidiscs to bring game prices down to the PS2 games' range. Similarly, the og Xbox had a similar price tag as the PS2 at £299 and matched the PS2 games' prices.

Looking back, I realised I was definitely privileged, something I obviously didn't understand back then because we (my 2 siblings and I) had all 3 late-noughties consoles; the PS3, the Xbox 360, and the Wii. Again, my memory might be slightly hazy here since this was nearly 20 years ago now but I believe the Xbox 360 came out at £299 but stepped up its game prices to £50 mark, the Wii was the cheapest system of the 3 at under £200 and its games were the cheapest too falling in the £30-40 range. On the other hand, the PS3 (the original fat one) came it at a whopping £425 at launch with £50 games and Blu-Ray disc support, later on they would release the PS3 slim and super slim both of which were cheaper than the original console.

Following that we entered the Wii U and Switch, Xbox One, and PS4 era, and once again Nintendo delivered the cheapest console (Wii U) at £250 at launch, also taking the 2nd cheapest spot with the £279 Switch, the PS4 was next costing £349 at launch, and the Xbox One was the costliest coming it over £400, all 4 had the games costing an avg. of £60, which made the PS4 the most lucrative out of the 4 and so we only bought that one. The Switch of course had additional costs if you wanted a pair of Joy-Cons or a Pro Controller or if you wanted the upgraded Switch OLED which cost just over £300.

And finally, the Xbox Series X, the PS5, and now the Switch 2. For simplicity's sake I'll only be talking about the versions with disc readers for the Xbox and PS because we bought the PS5 that has the disc slot. So, the Switch 2 will cost £395 and its games are looking to be £75-85? compare that to Xbox Series X/PS5's release prices of £449 and on avg. games falling in the £60-70 range, that's a complete slap in the face.

If anyone can provide me some more information/insights on console and game prices over the years or make any corrections in what I've listed please feel free to. Apologies for the essay 😅",3,2025-04-04 10:12:29,remorse714

You can also unlock artifacts that let you customize how you play the game. Whether it being introducing harder rule sets or letting you choose what items you want so you can move away from the RNG mechanics.

Helldivers 2 is also a great game but feels more made for 4 players on higher difficulties. It also doesn't feel like you have much impact on the war campaign in the story because you are relying on others to organize what planets you attack or cutting off supply lines, etc.

gaming,1k14aip,mnj97r9,"The thing about Risk of Rain is that even though you get in runs where bosses just seem impossibly tough, you also end up in runs where you're compounding damage values to the moon and melting bosses ultrafast, and the joy of it all is the constant push to make the god run happen. When you get super familiar with the item catalogue, you start to know which items could break a run wide open, and so the gamble mindset kicks in and you keep fighting, even when its hard. It also gates some content behind some pretty complicated puzzles and hidden things that can be fun to sort out as a team, even if you do end up wiki searching the last few. There are also a ton of incredibly high quality mods for additional items and playable characters. It also has, in my humble opinion, the greatest goddamn video game OST of all time. 

Helldivers 2 is also very stellar, but it certainly is by far the most peak as a 4 player experience. You'll still have fun as a 2-stack, and maybe you can tolerate joining with randos, but just be aware that the progression well isn't endlessly deep or anything at this point. It also keeps getting updates that make it harder to run, so just be aware that what you're running it on may come into the picture. Enshrouded would be your best bet in that regard, in terms of running consistently, and having solid progression systems, and it sounds like it's maybe the safest pick for the two of you, but by my experience, you'll encounter something more unique and special with Risk of Rain 2 or Helldivers 2.",2,2025-04-17 04:48:09,ShoulderNo6458

The bumper failure is due to a bad seal where dirt gets into pressure switch that controls the bumper causing it to stick.  

Buy a small can of WD40 Contact Cleaner.  Be sure it's the contact cleaner and not regular WD40 though.  Take the face plate off the controller and spray down the pressure switch with the contact cleaner while pressing and releasing the bumper, reassemble, and congratulations you've fixed the entire problem in 5 minutes.  I'd recommend getting a cheap spudger so you don't damage the casing but not even necessary if you don't want to buy one.

There's nothing near the quality for some reason. I've tried many good controllers that also crap out and have buttons break, and they aren't even as good as the elite 2.


Machenike G5 Pro V2 is a good controller with Hall sticks. I've had bumpers fail twice though. 


Gulikit KK3 Max is also solid, but again I've had trigger issues. 


Haven't tried the 8bitdo ultimate yet. Always got steered away hearing it has a lot of software issues and some defective thumbstick issues as well. 


I wouldn't even spit on a ps5 controller. They're fucking awful. They feel like bargain bin madcatz toys. Just with some useless gimmicks and a trash battery. I pray someone finds a way to use non Sony controllers on the ps5. 


I've just accepted replacing my controller once a year or so. I play very high intensity games, I'm usually achievement hunting whatever ridiculously difficult game I can find so I put my controllers through a lot of abuse. 


If the elite 2 had Hall sticks it'd be perfect but with modified dead zones it's still overall better.

gaming,1jsnen5,mlr79ls,"✨ **Nouveau Concept de Brawler : Epo !** ✨

Salut la communauté Brawl Stars ! 🎮 J'ai imaginé un nouveau Brawler qui pourrait apporter une mécanique unique au jeu : **Epo**.

🔹 **Attaque Principale** : Epo tire des projectiles comme un mélange entre **Colt et Ricochet**, combinant précision et rebonds stratégiques pour atteindre les ennemis derrière les obstacles.

🔥 **Super** : Pendant **10 secondes**, Epo peut **imiter l'ulti** de n'importe quel Brawler allié ou ennemi sur le terrain, rendant son gameplay ultra-adaptatif et imprévisible !

🎨 **Idée de Design** : Epo serait un personnage à l'apparence futuriste, avec un hologramme scintillant autour de lui lorsqu'il active son Super.

🌌 **Skin Épique – Epo Galactique** 🚀 Epo adopte un look totalement cosmique ! Son corps devient une combinaison spatiale brillante avec des **effets de galaxies mouvantes**, et ses tirs ressemblent à des météorites traversant l’arène. Son Super génère une **aura étoilée** qui le fait ressembler à un voyageur interdimensionnel. Ce skin est de rareté **épique** et apporte des effets visuels incroyables !

J'aimerais beaucoup entendre vos avis sur ce concept ! Pensez-vous que ce Brawler aurait sa place dans Brawl Stars ? 😊

If you work on computers / in computers the new task manager is absolutely horrid as well as ditching the action center.

UAC is a pain in the ass now.

They took away the simplicity of a lot of things to make it look more modern (talking about you ToolTray Icon)

The network Selection methods as well as IPV4 configuration is now hidden behind 3 different submenus. 

Taskview is now crap for multiple desktops.

The TPM Requirements are stupid. Basically any CPU older than 3 years can't run windows 11. And if you can you aren't guaranteed any updates/security.

Project Zomboid - feels like old school sims, but with zombies and survival mechanics, inventory management

Baldur’s Gate 3 - DnD madness with a whole story and is absolutely replayable with multitudes of choices in story and character building, as well as endings (also inventory hell management)

No Man’s Sky - space exploration with story, resource management, (and also inventory management lol)

Satisfactory - make your own factory, inventory management, guided by quests 


These are just my favorites atleast :) No Man’s Sky and Baldur’s recently has updates, and they’re both so fun to get lost within the world so I highly recommend those. Both PZ and NMS have customized sandbox modes so you can play it however you want!

Half Life: Alyx does a lot of neat stuff, though it's very buttoned down in terms of simulation of the player body for comfort reasons and is also not quite an imsim. Boneworks and Blade & Sorcery go in the other direction to the point that it makes some people hurl, but given you can stomach it they allow for an incredible amount of player agency with combat and traversal.

The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners I feel strikes a nice balance between the two, leaving simulation of the lower half the body (walking etc) abstract and simplified allowing it to be comfortable, but hands and arms are simulated including physical weight of objects. Melee combat feels weighty and impactful, while traversing doesn't have the wobble motion of Boneworks and B&S making it much easier to stomach. As games, it and it's sequel are sort of Deus Ex-lite but firmly in ""AA"" territory in terms of production value.

Something like Assassins creed will bring you to a new area and give you a bunch of missions, and then you move on to the next area, and do more missions.

In GTA and RDR, you'll get a mission that *involves* you travelling to a new part of the map or seeing something else.

I'm thinking the large scale heists where you fly, drive and shoot your way across the terrain, but there are smaller escort missions that take you out of Los Santos to show you the desert for the first time, and then later, a mission that takes you back into the city. The beauty of those, is that there is immersive dialogue because it's within a mission.

In RDR, the first time I saw Saint Denis was a mission that took me there.. and it's unlike anything else on the map... And you could play the game for 30 hours and then be like 'holy shit, there's a full blown city here too!!'",3,2025-04-10 17:11:16,WeekendInner4804

gaming,1jrtlst,mlhew58,"EverQuest, the OG 3D MMO from 1999. I have a deep and unmatched love for the classic era of the game, and private servers such as P1999 and especially the more recent Project Quarm have brought me back to the game yet again. There's truly nothing like it.


The forced interconnectedness and reliance on other players created a feeling that has never even been close to being replicated in any MMO since, and that's not even touching on the amazing classes that are so much more unique than any other MMO since as well.


Besides that I still play some other old MMO's via private servers, such as City of Heroes and Star Wars Galaxies. But EverQuest is truly my own neverending quest.",3,2025-04-05 02:54:46,KrazzeeKane

For me, it’s been *Apex Legends* for the fast-paced action and team play, and *Rocket League* for when I just want something that’s easy to jump into but still feels competitive. I get the Fortnite thing too, the chapters definitely made it harder to keep up. But yeah, sometimes it's nice to just fall back on games like *DBD* and *R6 Siege* where you know exactly what you're getting.

gaming,1jr52cl,mlc1rjg,"It depends on the game and what its trying to deliver and what you're after. 

Gameplay in Disco Elysium consists of clicking characters and talking to them yet it fully delivers as an experience because it so perfectly written. But you're not going to enjoy it if you're not after story.

Balatro has no semblance of a story yet it fully delivers as an experience because its so perfectly designed and balanced around its gameplay loop. But you're not going to enjoy it if you're not after a pure gameplay experience.

Some games are a perfect fusion of multiple aspects whilst some may be lacking in some areas. The importance of what is nailed is going to depend on you as a player as well as the design goals of the devs.",16,2025-04-04 06:36:11,isthisthingon47

gaming,1jr52cl,mlc3ijr,"It's entirely subjective and will vary by reviewer

gaming,1jr52cl,mlbzay8,">while lesser budget titles from non big name studios seem to get harsher scores for doing the same thing.

This part is whats important. game journos will scores games differently depending on who made them. Also considering what games lately are praised for stories, Im unsure they can even recognize one :)

  
As to answer to question in my opinion. It depends on the game. Some games are pure gameplay and story is not there at all or just to push action further. Those obviously should be scored heavily on gameplay quality. Imagine if marvel rivals for example was scored on story over gameplay, it wouldnt make any sense. 

On other hand you have story heavy games like adventure games, visual novels and so on. Imagine if Disco Elysium for example was scored on gameplay over writing. It wouldnt make any sense either.",6,2025-04-04 06:16:02,Dealric
gaming,1jr52cl,mlc2tf2,"This is why some sources pulled away from a number score. All judging is subjective, that's why sports use a panel to reduce bias. Metacritic showed up because of this. Gaming is much more diverse than it was a decade ago, and understanding the reviewers' preferences is important(also reading the review and not just looking at the number is huge)

Generally, most larger publications want someone who is into the genere reviewing. I'd give side scrollers a way lower score than they deserve because I don't get on with the genere. Sometimes out of place reviews are there because it wasn't the right reviewer. 

Once the generes separate a bit further (like music, movies) it will be easier to lock in what makes a good game. Right now, games are kinda lumped into a gaint mess(+sports). Some people really seem to care way too much about games, clearly not designed for them. Until we divide these generes mlre, we're going to have to look at the substance of the review and not just a score.",2,2025-04-04 06:45:54,ethhlyrr

gaming,1jr52cl,mlc2ggd,"It depends. How important story elements are depends on the type of game it is. The story of The Last of Us is WAY more important than the gameplay. The mechanics in TLoU are serviceable but not best in class. The game isn't really designed for you to play it more than a couple of times. Yet it remains as a top tier game that I'd recommend to anyone. Why? Because its a story game with a phenomenal story. 

Meanwhile Souls games almost embody the opposite. They have stories and lore and those elements aren't bad but they are rather subtle and can be entirely missed. Instead those titles are built entirely on a ruthlessly well designed gameplay cycle that drives the entire theme of the game. The gameplay offers avenues for the weak to overcome horrific challenges while also allowing for extreme levels of skill expression from those who are dedicated to it. The mechanics tend to be deeply nuanced but simple enough to easily grasp. The story often acts less as an actual story and more as a powerful ambiance to set your epic battles in. 

But something notable is that in both cases every single category in the game will hit a score of at least GOOD ENOUGH. When a game starts falling below that standard they'll start taking hits for their failures. Its why there are so few actually good Souls clones and why some huge AAA titles will have a bad story and suddenly you realize that its gameplay is this horrible hollow chore that gets in your way constantly.",2,2025-04-04 06:42:25,Dangthing
