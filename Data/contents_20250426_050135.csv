The terrine had to chill in the fridge and so did this so timing worked out pretty well.

Let a stick of butter get to room temp then mix it with a head of minced garlic, a bunch of parsley, scallions, and some fresh oregano & thyme. Roll it in plastic wrap to make a cylinder shape then toss it in the freezer.

Once it stiffens up, beat your meat flat then wrap it around the butter, wrap, roll, and chill in the freezer until firm.

Flour, egg, bread, egg, bread, fry until crispy, then bake at 400° until it's cooked through.

1jpqo3l,reddit,[HOMEMADE] Bacon Egg and Cheese Egg Rolls,"**INGREDIENTS:**

* 2 quarts oil for frying
* 5 slices bacon cooked and crumbled
* 5 eggs
* 2 tablespoons milk
* salt and pepper to taste
* 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese shredded
* 5 egg roll wrappers
* Your choice of any other ingredients (I went with diced sautéd red and green bell peppers)
* Your preferred dipping sauce (I used Buffalo ranch)

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

* Heat oil in deep fryer or heavy skillet to 350°F.
* In a bowl whisk together the eggs, milk, salt and pepper.
* Scramble your eggs in a nonstick pan over medium heat until just set. You want them slightly soft since they'll cook a bit more when fried. Set aside to cool slightly.
* Cook any other ingredients you plan to add to your egg rolls. I added diced sautéd red and green bell peppers.
* Lay out an egg roll wrapper in a diamond shape with one of the corners pointing toward you.
* Spoon some scrambled eggs and add some crumbled bacon, shredded Cheddar and any other ingredients you want into the center of the egg roll wrapper and using your fingers wet all four edges. This will help the egg roll stay together after you roll it.
* Next, take the corner that’s pointing toward you and fold it up over the filling, fold the left and right ends in and roll the egg roll up tightly. Repeat for the remaining egg rolls.
* Fry egg rolls in batches for 3 minutes or until golden brown.
* Drain on paper towels and serve with buffalo ranch or your preferred dipping sauce.

Or if you'd like to air fry them instead you can air fry them just preheat your air fryer to 350°F and fry them for 8 minutes or until golden brown.",2025-04-02 14:58:05,food,food,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,836,16,,0.99,https://i.redd.it/6zbas2j3rfse1.jpeg,DudeFoods

1jv9svp,reddit,[Homemade] Burger Buns,"Hello dear Viewers , today I’m sharing the recipe for some delicious homemade burger buns , the same ones i used for chicken burgers in my last post. You can also make them without the eggs. 
This recipe is apt for making 6 Buns. 

INGREDIENTS:

1. 225g/  of all-purpose flour, which is roughly 1 1/2 cups.

2. 1 egg. Just one egg will do the trick.

3. 10 ml / 2 tsp oil, You can use any type of oil you prefer. I used EV olive oil. Use 35 ml oil if you want them eggless.

4. 30g / 2 tbsp sugar, We'll need a bit of sweetness to balance out the flavors.

5. 15g/1 tsp of blocked yeast, Make sure to crumble it into small pieces before using. If you’re using active dry yeast then use 11.25g. 

6. 170ml/3/4 cups of water.
We'll need this to activate the yeast and bring the dough together.

7. Sesame seeds for topping (optional)
 

Procedure:

Take the blocked yeast and crumble it into small pieces. Then, mix it with 170ml of warm water. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes, or until it becomes frothy and bubbly.

While the yeast is activating, let's mix the dry ingredients together. In a large bowl, combine the AP flour , sugar, and a pinch of salt. Mix well until everything is fully incorporated.

Next, add the egg and oil to the dry ingredients. Mix until the dough starts to come together.

Now it's time to add the yeast mixture. Gradually pour it into the dough and mix until everything is fully incorporated.

Knead the dough for 10-15 minutes, or until it becomes smooth and elastic. You can use a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment or knead it by hand.

Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rest in a warm, draft-free place for 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.

Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release any air bubbles. Divide it into 6 equal portions, each weighing around 80g.

Shape each portion into a round. Place the shaped dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving about 1 inch of space between each bun.

Brush the tops of the buns with a little water or egg wash, and sprinkle with sesame seeds.

Cover the dough with a clean towel and let it proof in a warm, draft-free place for 30-45 minutes, or until it has doubled in size again. 
If you’re looking for some perfectly round buns then use a stainless-steel baking rings.

Preheat your oven to 180°C. Place the baking sheet with the dough into the preheated oven and bake for 12 minutes, or until the buns are golden brown.

Remove the buns from the oven, brush them with some oil while they're cooling, and then let them rest for at least 15-20 minutes. ",2025-04-09 16:19:15,food,food,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,663,39,,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jv9svp,Playful-Ad2307

1jpakqh,reddit,[Homemade] Beef Rib Bao Buns,"Smoked a Dino Rib over the weekend and have never made Bao buns before, thought it would be fun to make a beef rib Bao bun and make one giant bun to match the rib. Came out great! 

Bao Buns receipe: Ingredients 1/3 cup warm water 1/2 cup warm milk 1 tbsp active dry yeast 4 tbsp sugar, divided half 2 tbsp neutral oil, I used canola oil 2 1/2 cups all purpose flour 1/2 tsp baking powder 1/4 tsp salt

Mix yeast with warm water & milk, and 2 tbs sugar and let sit for 5 mins. Mix the rest of the dry ingredients together. After yeast has started yeasting, mix the dry with the wet ingredients and mix, I used a stand mixer. After it turns into a soft dough, roll into a ball and let sit in a bowl covered until it doubles size (2hours). Roll out dough to 1/4 inch thick and use a 3 inch ring cutter or about the size of a wine glass rim to cut out little circles. Put oil on the circles so it won’t stick and fold in half. Steam buns for 10 mins.

Ribs: Smoked at 225F for 1 hour, 3 hours at 250F, and 4 hours at 275F. Pulled at a 200F internal temp, wrapped with wagu tallow and let rest for 2 hours. ",2025-04-01 23:46:25,food,food,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,575,18,,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jpakqh,runs_with_airplanes

I will post the recipe later today if you guys want! The only thing is, I don’t know how to make it spicy!! i’m not sure what type of chili oil/pepper mixture they normally use. I usually get spice level 10 at restaurants and I want to make the same at home! I tried using a chili oil I normally use in other dishes, but it gave it a very distinct different flavor that changed it a lot. When I ask for another serving of chili oil at the restaurant, they give me something that looks like thick pepper paste but not blended up like gochujang; almost like unblended gochujang is the best way I can describe it and i’m assuming that’s what they add to make it spicy.
