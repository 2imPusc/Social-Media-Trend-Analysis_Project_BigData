Hi, I'm a Northern Vietnamese, but I have many Viet Kieu friends online! I just want to share my explanation based on my experience.

I guess most of the people you asked must be adults (maybe over 30?). If that’s the case, then I can say that this generation often has friends, family, or even themselves who were involved in the Vietnam War, especially those from the North (If you've read about Vietnamese history, you might understand). Of course, blaming innocent people is negative, but there's often some prejudice and resentment in their attitude, which is somewhat understandable. On the bright side, it shows how much Vietnamese people respect older generations. Empathy should come from both sides.

I know you might feel disappointed about the prejudice against Viet Kieu, but don’t worry, many young people today are more open-minded. They might still be a little conservative when it comes to politics, but they won’t reject cool friends 😋😋😋",5,2025-04-07 17:38:07,meRyrylielafw97

VietNam,1jxdkzg,mmpufxn,"Yesterday some dude on here suggested that ""Trump is a manchild"" and ""he gonna fold once inflation hit US"" so Vietnam just need to wait for the orange man to pushback. I wrote a comment but busy and didn't send it, so i repost this here again:





The tariffs in effect in 8/4, while he announced it in 5/4, after just three days.                  







So let's say, an US importer import from a Vietnamese manufacturer a particular product and sell it in the US market through retail chain. With the FOB price of the product, meaning that includes manufacturing cost and transportation costs, export taxes, when the products sitting at the Vietnamese port, Vietnamese manufacturers have 20% profits margin at that price. Meanwhile, US importer, after the shipping cost of the product to US, duty fee, tax( if have), VAT,  to retail chain to the hand of end customers, their profits margin is also 20%.           






Now, if the tariffs is 46%, literally, every product that importer bring to US and sell at the same price, they would sell at a loss because the tariffs is higher than their profits margin. If they rise price, people would buy it less or find alternative, it's called market elasticity. In reality they would be very hesitant to raise the price of the products, because it shoo away loyal customers base, especially if there's an alternative brand( just imagine what happens if Cocacola raise price compared to pepsi).       







So what the US importer should do? Find an alternative supplier from country with less tariffs? Unfortunately finding alternative manufacturers is not easy like upvote and downvote on Reddit. You have to look for their FOB price compared to the old one, see their quality, reputation, secure payment, local taxes and paperwork. Then find shipping companies for that route. It take times, and a lot of money. Or they can withhold the product in the Vietnamese ports, wait to see how things fold out to change accordingly. 





Oh, so they're keeping the containers in the port. But that cost money, to rent land plots and maintain the product itself. This is very nasty, especially for goods that can't keep long like agriculture products, especially fruits and vegetables. It's because they need to keep cool to maintain the fresh (which cost money to run refrigeration), and even then, they will gradually losing their freshness. On the news you hear ""Dưa hấu giải cứu"" ""Mít giải cứu"", it is just basically Vietnamese fruits and vegetables, get turned back by importers so they selling it to domestic consumers at discounted price. The clearest example you can see is during Covid, when China temporarily halt Vietnam goods cross border because they find virus on Vietnamese fishes. Around 5000 containers stuck daily on Laocai border, truckers have to run AC to keep the fruits fresh which cost 2-5m vnd per day.




With profits margin of 20%. Let's say, a container worth of good is 500m vnd. If they need 2m vnd per day to maintain the container, if it's not shipped for 50  plus days, the manufacturer would be at profit loss for that container. And if it's goods such as vegetables, fruits, meat, the cost to maintain even higher and the time they can hold even shorter before the whole thing go bad. For the small-middle size businesses, with limited capital. Each month, they have to pay land rent, workers wage, bank interests, electric bills...If the products are not shipped to get money back for circulation, they will bankrupt soon. 





And it's just short-middle term. In long term, what scary is the uncertainty. US market related companies, maybe back in the past they find Vietnam is a good place to replace China to avoid trade war, now see that Vietnam can also in the list of Trump, they would want to divert the supply chain partly away from Vietnam to avoid a situation like this happen. [This article about how much fashion companies hit by this and they're thinking about reduce supply chain in Vietnam](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2025/04/02/trump-tariffs-on-vietnam-could-raise-prices-for-shoes-furniture-toys.html)





Vietnam has hundreds of thousands export oriented firms. 40% in there related to US market. Many of them specifically established to serve US market. If companies reduce operations in Vietnam, many of them would go out of business. Mass layoffs, high unemployment> people don't have money to spend> consumption drop> businesses stop expand or reduce operations> even more layoffs. A vicious cycle that could push Vietnam into recession. 





That's why you see, General secretary, PM, vice PM, all have to immediately go to US to negotiate. People on this sub who keep chanting ""Vietnam bend the knee and kiss the rings"" are people who are not directly affected by this, and the economic downturn wave have not hit them yet, so they can talk like that. For companies, they're sitting on the fire when their goods is staying at the port.",42,2025-04-12 11:37:35,Oceanshan

It also lowers the perceived value of the place if customers are buying premium food and next to them someone’s eating a 50c banh mi.

VietNam,1jvo05c,mmcqz1e,"Some major factors I can think of:

* Crowded cafes and restaurants attract even more customers. An empty cafe or restaurant is generally avoided because ""the food / drink must be terrible if they have no customers"".
* Vietnamese cafes don't invest much on foods, I guess their profit mainly comes from the drinks so they don't mind people bringing food from outside, as long as they buy drinks.
* In Vietnam, there are fewer religious restrictions related to food. In Malaysia and Indonesia for example, you are generally not allowed to bring food from outside because it may contaminate the space and utensils with non-halal foods.

VietNam,1jryvod,mliknwr,"I'm from Finland and it's more common here and in the rest of Nordic countries than in other places in Europe. By law the parents' ""maintenance liability"" for children end when the children turn 18. But the moving out is mainly because the government provides you with assistance when you move out. On top of getting free higher education the government will also pay the students a monthly allowance and about 50% of their rent. And if you're unemployed you get other social benefits like housing benefit and unemployment benefit.  Of course if you already have a job at 18 then good for you. And then there's free universal health care on top of all that. 

So, even if you're a full time student you're not financially dependent on your parents anymore. This makes a huge difference to countries where you need a ton of money to get through the higher education. And that's why people move out very early. Personally I moved out and to another city as fast as I could get my benefits in order after the mandatory military service when I was 19, like almost all of my friends did. Not because I was ""kicked out"" but because I really just wanted to start my own life and not live under my parents' rules anymore.",38,2025-04-05 09:21:10,IhailtavaBanaani

VietNam,1jryvod,mlin9wa,"I feel oddly relevant in this conversation... In the VN channel. I am a former Taiwanese kid, married to a European guy (Polish). 

What's interesting is that if my partner had stayed in Poland, he would have technically been supported until he left university. The Polish side of the family came together, organized a very old apartment, chipped in to renovate it (both financial and labor), and gave him a small allowance to buy groceries and books. However, his immediate family who moved to the states, *demanded* he pay for rent and for his international tuition as a transfer student.... 

As a Taiwanese kid, I was welcome to stay at home... But, and this is a huge BUTT. I had to comply with my mother. She was very hard on me and toxic. I was asked to do chores otherwise she would accuse me of treating her house like a hotel. I was asked to do her homework or she will Burt herself. I also had no privacy, my room was rearranged without me knowing. My mail was opened. So I slept in my car, went to school to shower/work out, and worked part time to afford school. 

What I'm trying to say is that actually I think America is where the indoctrination of leaving when you are 18 is coming from. Whether it's my in laws using it to kick out my partner, or giving me the ability to work hard and scrimp/save, it's an American philosophy to be independent.",9,2025-04-05 09:50:40,stentordoctor

In Romania, when you finish high school, you either go to work or university. Parents usually give you just enough to survive so you’re forced to “grow” without being in an existential danger.

In richer countries with more socialist safety nets, the state gives you that bare minimum, so parents are usually off the hook completely. This is probably where that statement holds some truth, since some parents might get a taste of not giving a frik about you and just ignore you if times get tough. But those parents would probably kick you out in any culture.

Some parents also downsize when kids move out, so they’ll repurpose their rooms or move into smaller houses. My parents did the opposite, so me and my sister have our own rooms in a new house we only live in for one or 2 months a year. But they like having us around.

VietNam,1jug4ej,mm6aeli,"Nah, nope. Too long, did not read: The depiction of Vietnamese soldiers and combat is horribly wrong.

>!Few details in the movie depicts the Vietnamese soldiers wrongly. For instance, there is a playboy who at every night f\*cked a woman soldier, later she got pregnant and no one knows who is the cause? This kind of scene repeated at the final 5 minutes of the movie. You know, if such irresponsibility and immorality existed among Cu Chi warfighters, they wouldn't last very long against sweeping operations of the U.S. and ARVN forces. PAVN and NLF soldiers back then were known for their vigour, resilience, endurance and toughness. It doesn't take a bookworm to learn about many love stories among them, but they picked the worst one. Goddamn, this made me speechless.!<

>!Other details to be named:!<

>!1. There is a cooking scene and these fighters chose to emerge from the underground. They do not use the specialized kitchen (I do not remember the name of the engineer who designed it), but they use a normal kitchen. If anyone knows about how American air reconnaissance worked, then congratulations, that cooking team just have their entire unit commit mass suicide.!<

>!2. At the opening scene there is a guerrilla woman dumping one of her teammates to the river. Like, really? PAVN does have a code for handling deceased soldiers. Whoever died will be properly buried, I know that many dead soldiers has not been recollected yet, but no. This is just mishandling your teammates and no real Vietnamese soldiers did that. !<

>!3. Entering and exiting the cave freely without saying a correct password. That is a kinda bold move, what if someone hostile can infiltrate the unit and leak intelligence? Watch The Pacific, there are many friendly fires for those who exit their foxholes at night to do personal hygiene, only to return and get shot dead by your teammates.!<

Conclusion: The good thing about this movie is it does not overvalue anything or lean too much on ideology, and I appreciate the crew's hardworking for the upcoming anniversary of Vietnam's reunification, but they could have worked better than this.",3,2025-04-09 07:19:04,red_hulk1995

VietNam,1k2v3bz,mny767a,"I’m moving from US to VN to be with my wife there soon. 

Odd Immigration story. I was traveling multiple flights in the U.S. to make it to Vietnam Airlines departure in San Francisco. My second trip to VN, last being a year before. 

My two U.S. domestic flights were late to San Fran, causing me to miss the 9pm VN Airlines flight. I was a bit put off, as I had to buy another ticket to VN next night 9pm. 

So I went to the U.S. airline counter to complain, ask for a credit, etc. Got a big “No”. Was told had my US flight itinerary been “linked” to my VN flight - maybe could have been compensated. 

There really is no way to link domestic US flights ti VN airlines flight, as you have to buy the tickets separate. 

I got to VN, stayed for a month. Then when leaving, VN immigration pulls me aside for “random bag check” they went thru my things, but not very carefully or tearing it all apart. I was calm and complied. 

I was with my wife. A VN woman from the airlines and asked her if I knew why I was being searched. I casually replied the truth, had no idea. VN Airlines woman said the U.S. had flagged me for a search on my return to the U.S. 

The U.S. airlines had no idea I was getting in a flight to VN, until I complained about them being late. Maybe I was flagged out of spite by the U.S. 

The bag search was simple. I had sealed packages, they just asked what they were. Upon return, the U.S. customs officer asked me how much cash I was carrying. I pulled out my wallet and said “$20 U.S., I use my debit card” and had no issue with me.

VietNam,1k2612l,mnrk90n,"Alright let's get this fact straight right away so you wont ask further questions.

Yes, you are not wrong, Vietnam in the modern times has been countlessly listed as lacking freedom of religion to a good extent. As in they dont allow independant religions or worships to form, and the state constantly intervene or disrupt with followers of independant religions or independant worshippers. So Vietnam is not exactly free when it comes to freedom religion.

Now as for your other questions. Mosque as in Islam dont really exist because Muslim never really took roots in Vietnam. You can still find churches for Catholicism / Chritianity and temples for Buddhism though as those are more prevailent here since Vietnam has had quite a history with those religions.

As for the Cham well... I see that you know about Dai Viet's conquest of Champa but I think a lot dont exactly understand how much of an astrocity Dai Viet caused.

I will just say this.

You see, the Ming dynasty's consulate came to check up on the Champa empire as Champan diplomats requested the help of the Ming dynasty to intervene with the war and restore the kingdom. However, when they arrived at the kingdom to verify the diplomats' words they saw no trace of Champa culture left or any Champa people as Dai Viet has thoroughly done an ethnic cleansing of the region. So the Ming dynasty just told the Champa diplomats to give up as there isnt really anything left to restore. What's most shocking however is this cleansing all happened I kid you not in just merely 5 years. 

So yea, that's why you dont really see Champa culture nowadays and that's why it needs preservations.",37,2025-04-18 14:35:25,OrangeIllustrious499

For the ruling class. I don't know about nowadays, but back then then maybe (the Vietnamese history book doesn't mention the ethnicity of the rulling kings or emperors back then. Same for now, the government doesn't went out of their way to mention the ethnic makeup of the current cabinets)

Probably because there are like 8 mosques in Vietnam 

There are 5,400 Churches and 20,000 Buddhist temple in Vietnam as Vietnam is a Buddhist country with some Confucius influence and Western influence from the Christian missionaries which dated back before the French colonial era

As for the Cham, they were largely ethnically cleansed centuries ago (late 15th-early 16th) when the Dai Viet finally conquered the South and destroyed the Champa empire. 

More recently, they were between a rock and hard place. During the Republic of Vietnam (and the French Occupation before it) they were not viewed kindly. Not really persecuted, but definitely had to suffer prejudice. That, the war in general, and fears of persecution under the secular communist regime caused many to flee into Cambodia. Then the Khmer Rouge started their genocide and the Cham were on their checklist. In 1979, the Khmer Rouge invaded Vietnam through areas with large Cham populations.

Some of their descendants are alive today, namely in Chau Doc, An Giang province.There's several mosques there and many people are noticably Muslim.

They don't know how their architecture works, nor are they aware of anything other than speaking a few words of the original language. You'll have better luck learning about the original Champa culture from the Champa diaspora pockets in the aforementioned locations. 

Islam is not prohibited outright in Vietnam, it's just really unpopular. There are mosques in Saigon, I've definitely seen one (though very small and modest, I know it's a mosque since the sign reads as such. But it's not a grand temple like in an Islamic country). But only in Saigon since it's an international melting pot of foreign cultures. Otherwise you won't find a mosque in rural areas. As for why you won't find modern Champa Islamic temples, it's because as mentioned they've been genocided to the point of barely knowing  who they were anymore.

VietNam,1jvuqua,mmdho3m,"
There are several factors, but in terms of pure economic growth, I can point out three points if you think of GDP as a function of capital (K) and TFP (A). Let's not discuss labor quantity now.

1. **Investment Quality (K):** One dollar invested should yield the highest possible GDP growth. The simplest measure of this is the ICOR (Incremental Capital-Output Ratio). Intuitively, the lower, the better—because achieving the same level of GDP growth would require less capital. Historically, Taiwan’s ICOR was 2.7 (1981–1990), South Korea’s was 3.2 (1981–1990), Japan’s was 3.2 (1961–1970), China’s was 4.1 (1991–2003), and Thailand’s was 4.1 (1981–1995). Vietnam’s was high at 5.92 (2010–2016) [source](https://mof.gov.vn/webcenter/portal/ttncdtbh/pages_r/l/chi-tiet-tin?dDocName=MOFUCM236509). This is clearly due to bulky and inefficient governance, lack of long-term planning (e.g., the Cat Linh–Ha Dong rail project), and widespread corruption (many have recently been exposed and tried). If Vietnam wants to sustain high growth, it must bring this number down to between 3 and 4, or even better, like Taiwan's.

2. **TFP (A):** We cannot rely on low-cost labor forever—we must raise labor productivity. A country grows much like a worker does. First, you learn to make existing things. During this phase, you're mostly copying and learning from others, so low pay is acceptable. Once you're efficient and have some capital, you can start innovating—doing R&D and creating new technology to capture more value. Vietnam’s R&D spending is currently 0.43% of GDP (2021), roughly the same as China's in 1996 (0.56%). [source](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/GB.XPD.RSDV.GD.ZS?locations=CN-VN-JP-1W-TH-US) I believe we are still in that phase, learning from technology transfers from Japanese and Korean firms. With more experience and exposure, we can begin meaningful innovation.

In 2021, China’s R&D spending reached 2.43% of GDP—almost matching the global average of 2.62%. Judging by Vietnam’s R&D ratio, we’re not ready to fully innovate yet, though we can copy and innovate in parallel. The government is trying to increase R&D spending by restructuring the budget and administration. But that alone isn’t enough. To incentivize innovation, we must improve the rule of law, patent protection, and the ability to monetize innovations. Higher education must also be reformed to allow talented people trained overseas to come back for research. These changes will disrupt the status quo and affect a lot of groups of interests—but they are necessary.

3. **Governance:** The current government seems ambitious. They aim for double-digit growth, major infrastructure projects (like high-speed rail and metro systems), and systemic restructuring. We don’t face the same barriers as other countries—no caste system like India, no political instability, no wars, and relatively few natural disasters. What we need is a responsible, corruption-free government-- from top to bottom. Petty bribes allow unqualified people into a system that needs competence. Corruption drains public funds for private gain, often laundered overseas. Hiding statistics blinds us to reality. Without addressing these issues, neither ICOR nor R&D spending will reach their potential.

Regarding new tariffs, if Vietnam can attract investment, some capital inflow from China may come our way. Even though global demand might fall due to higher prices, Vietnam can leverage its domestic market of 100 million people. As you mentioned the case of Japan, Vietnam can learn from that example. The real question is: can we use this opportunity and capital to improve investment efficiency and human capital (through education and R&D)? Or will we waste it on inefficient projects and corruption? Laos, Cambodia, and other countries are also in the game. Once the cake is gone, it may not come back.",24,2025-04-10 12:03:57,brevity142

The first thing any miracle economy did was to be able to manufacture essential goods. Japan, Taiwan, Korea, Thailand did that. Vietnam has nothing worth noting in 2025. besides some really crappy kitchenware or electronics. Why crappy you ask? cheap components from China.

Tried to copy China, but too dumb to copy technology for themselves lol. 

You're also forgeting that Vietnam is a not a free market country, but a state-dictated capitalist country. There are no private corporations in Vietnam, all that exist are state-funded and state-controlled. 

The reason is simple, Vietnamese business landscape is extremely corrupted and as soon as an individual sets up a mega business, government will jump in to either hi-jack control, or annex the business into one of their state-controlled businesses. This limits market competition, and in turn limits innovation and growth. This also makes Vietnamese business not reacting fast enough to capitalize on anything.",5,2025-04-10 14:01:06,Thick_Help_1239

I kinda drifted away and eventually drifted back. They were very excited about catching up and so was I. When they closed their restaurant doors, the last few days, we came in to wish them will and that we hope the best for them, they wished us the best in life also. 

Its just what we do. At least the more outgoing folks do this more.

Còn chưa kể huấn luyện để dùng F-16 nữa. Không có máy bay Lead In Fighter Trainer (LIFT) cùng hệ thì biên chế làm sao được? Hay là lại mua L-39 bản cho châu Âu? Hay Yak-130 nó quá giống M-346 rồi nên không cần nữa? Tòm lại tin vịt hết thôi, không có đâu.",21,2025-04-22 00:21:46,thenoobtanker

From 18 to 27, your local phường đội, not công an, do annual round of physical checkup and score your physicality. Students usually go to school registrar office to verify their attendance for exemption from service.

Short answer, you will not get arrested. You are currently enrolled, therefore you are exempted.

However, by involving in the process of getting the new ID, you would raise a flag on yourself and give phường đội a reason to come poke at you & your family regarding the whole deal of getting your exempt paperwork done. They probably already know you are studying abroad, and they know well how to make the matter complicated (e.g. ask for the verification paper with wet signature not email, translated to Viet, notarized...).

1. The lane separation is basically useless. At the very least, there should be a physical barrier or grade separation to prevent cars or motorbikes from entering—like the Adelaide O-Bahn system.


2. It lacks short headways and high frequency. Being a BRT system, it should have been much more preferable than metro systems due to shorter waiting times and better accessibility. This is why it failed to compete with the nearby metro line.

VietNam,1k1cbeg,mnl2urh,"Oh oh, history telling time, my favourite part-time.

First let's clear how people think of these medias. Basically it depends on the generation, young people prefer more dramas/love story, etc... but older people from the 20th century may prefer some more classical stuffs.

Now time for history learning.

So you see, under the communist party you can actually divide it into 3 periods of literature which are during-war, post-war and post-2000.

1. During war period can be splitted into North and South but I will just cover the North in this section. Many form of literatures in the North were banned, particularly the anti-war and romance genre of literatures. Because it was deemed these literatures were anti-revolutionary and impacts the greater cause of trying to reunite with the South. During this time many writers were banned from writing such as Văn Cao, Quang Dũng, Trần Dần, etc... because their works were all deemed to be anti-revolutionary and didnt serve the greater cause of war and unification.

This period gave rise to a few significant authors which Vietnamese might have heard of which are Trường Chinh, Tố Hữu and Xuân Thủy. All of their works mostly focus around making war propaganda to enlighten the image of the soldier and to serve the greater cause which is communism. Particularly Tố Hữu who was so goddamn good at making propaganda he became the head of economy management despite being an author(what could go wrong).

So most of the works during this time in the North were basically akin to war propaganda and to serve the communism cause.

2. Fast foward to 1975 after the Fall of Saigon and the end of the war.

By this period, the Party decided to loosen its grip on literature because the war was over and the cause has been achieved. 

So they decided to let all the authors they have previously banned from writing before write again and decided to take a USSR like approach when it comes to literature but even better, they decided to let people criticize the Party's actions, delve into deeper darker topics about society, the pain and aftermath of warfare and how it impacted people.

Because to the Party this was a period of rebuilding society after the war, so they thought to themselves to rebuild society properly, there must be a certain amount of criticism so the country can develope.

During this period the literature focuses mostly on the joy of reunification, dark topics about society, how people dealt with the aftermath of war. Some notable stories for these include Bảo Ninh's Sorrow of War, Nguyễn Minh Châu's The faraway boat(Chiếc Thuyền Ngoài Xa), Tô Hoài's 3 different people (3 người khác), etc...

But of course they were still aiming for socialism at the time so the thought of having western pop cultures, romance and more nudity were still largely frowned upon.

3. This is where the post 2000 era of literature comes in.

With the new group of young people willing to accept new ideas, they brought in many form of different literatures from around the world. But the 2 most influential ones are def Japanese and Chinese for obvious reasons. Now most of Vietnam's lirerature landscape looks akin to smt like Chinese and Japanese. 

However, in the wake of this post-2000 era, something from the post war period has been lost which is the delving deeper into bad aspect of society and criticism of party directly. Of course there are still people writing about these but it just doesnt garner as much attention as before or it gets censored.

So that's the history of it lol",31,2025-04-17 13:53:47,OrangeIllustrious499

VietNam,1k1cbeg,mnlbxho,"OK, first things first, Vietnamese in general don’t read a lot of books (or they don’t read books period). Vietnamese literary also suffered but of course Western literature suffered more. Years ago you wouldn’t have seen the Western classics in that picture, not because of censorship but because people simply weren’t interested in them enough for translations, and there were few with English proficiency back then. It’s only recently, with what can only be described as a massive rush for ESL education, that interest in works by Mark Twain, Dickens, Hugo, etc rose significantly. 

There is also no framework provided by Vietnamese education, school and society, that helps people think about politics theoretically and philosophically. As such, Aristotle, Nietzsche, or Arendt are not appreciated despite having no relations to the modern communism (well Arendt did, but many of her works didn’t, like Eichmann in Jerusalem). Books written by start-up founders, on the other hand, are everywhere. People read books with very practical purposes here, either for mindless entertainment or life improvement. 

Also, I don’t know about Saigon, but I assume you went to the official book street (phố sách) in Hanoi. That’s government-established, essentially only has recently-printed books, and not where the good stuffs are. Go to Đinh Lễ, that’s where the niche Hanoi intellectuals get their books, a lot of them extremely old or banned.",6,2025-04-17 14:39:57,Open-Sentence2417

VietNam,1jprgko,ml2wun7,"That’s similar to my recent trip.

We stayed 3 days in HCMC which was probably 2 days too many. Wish we’d done just 1 and spent more time out on the Mekong Delta (only had time for a day trip). Hot, humid, 8 million motorcycles - glad we saw it all, but wouldn’t go back.

Spent a couple of days in Dalaat - which was a nice way to detoxify.

Hoi An is quaint if perhaps the most overtly touristy place I visited. Interestingly more SEA tourists there than Western tourists. i’d go back - but I think I’ve probably overdosed on temples / pagodas after the last visit.

Didn’t visit DaNang, but headed to Hue for a couple of days to do the DMZ and the train journey along the coast. Wouldn’t visit again - not because it was unpleasant, but because I think we’d seen what we wanted to see.

After that Ninh Binh (actually Tam Coc) for Skull Island scenery, bike riding, dragon mountains and more bike riding. Again slightly more overtly touristy at Tam Coc, but bicycling and scenery was fine.

If you’ve missed riding the Ha Giang loop, I would definitely put 4 days aside for that (3 days / 2 nights + travel). My favourite part of my visit - amazing scenery and completely safe riding pillion with and Easy Rider.

Cat Ba was interesting - although I didn’t have the best of weather so perhaps didn’t see it in it’s best light and cut short my visit If you’re planning a cruise, make sure to book in advance to get what you want. Lan Ha Bay seemed a lot less crowded than Ha Long. Beware there’s an awful lot of construction going on in the main town - I guess it’s tourist accommodation.

Finished in Hanoi  - I enjoyed the vibe in Hanoi a lot more than HCMC, so definitely worth spending time there. Maybe it’s a little less hectic than HCMC even though it has nearly as many motorbikes. The Old Quarter is fun - but you can’t walk 5 minutes at night with being offered a massage 😉.  Ho Chi Minh’s resting place is worth visiting - but I enjoyed the vibe / atmosphere at night. If you’re planning on visiting Train Street, don’t believe the reports about it being closed - and remember there’s a north part and south part (which is a little less touristy)

Enjoy your trip - it’s a fascinating county.",2,2025-04-02 19:59:09,Fuzzbass2000

Those few things are already falling apart with broken zippers and faded/peeling logos. This year I'm buying 2 pairs of shoes and that's it.

Peanut cookies (they're kind of like a brittle. Usually can find a market where a cookie lady will sell them.

Mangoes. I kid you not, my suitcase is usually 12kg of mangoes. They don't require declaration at customs for UK either. Make sure to get the big green ones so they don't get damaged in transit. 

Instant noodles. If you love vietnamese food, go to the instant food aisle in a supermarket (AEON or the like). They will have some decent premade soups and noodle packets you can enjoy at home. I've never tried the pho ones but I know the bun rieu, mi ga, and hu tieu ones are good. 

In terms of skincare it's mostly Korean brands. Still cheaper than buying it and having it shipped to the UK but not by much. There is a Vietnamese brand called Cocoon I tried. Ended up buying their most hydrating moisturiser which turned out to be their best item. Since my skin is so dry I use it as a day time cream and it's pretty good. Otherwise I'd stock up on sun screen. 

Fashion-wise, if you mean Vietnamese designers then yes, you should definitely check out places like Libe, Maven, Xeoxo, Into Eight. The clothes are very high quality and tend to lean into hyper feminine styles. Rue Miche is more streetwear. Definitely buy some sunglasses since they're super cheap and you can get some unique frames.

VietNam,1jzmg86,mnc1625,"It's not too far from what i wrote in previous post. In short term, foreign importers would terminate order or halt shipping the current batch of goods to see how things unfolds. But that few days alone could cause serious damage for manufacturers ( storage and container maintenance costs, withhold money payments).




But in long term, what FDIs see is the uncertainty of things they probably didn't take into calculations before: Vietnam could face same fate as China, target of Trade War. 





Since the reformation to open markets, Vietnam follow the same path as China: becomes a manufacturing hub for international companies. Overtime, the supply chain open up to support those companies factories ( eg: you make a fan, engine and IC may imported but the body and blade can be extruded, made in VN for cheaper price), meanwhile the government built infrastructures ( Điện, Đường, Trường, Trạm) and reduce paperwork, regulations, tax policy and subsidies ( albeit there's still many flaws). This, overall made the logistics more efficient, reduce manufacturing costs which make FDI see Vietnam even more attractive with Political stability+ cheap labor+ good infrastructure combo. Basically, a smaller version of China. 




That's being said, Vietnam still can't achieve the level of efficiency of China: smaller economy of scale, supply chain doesn't go as deep as China, infrastructure is not as good and corruption is too much( it's not like there's no corruption in China, but level of harassment of local officials to ""make money"", especially against smaller native businesses). So companies still choose China as top priority, then other SEA countries that already had a well established supply chain in place thanks to being ""factories"" of those companies for a long time( Thailand, Malaysia, Philippine, Indonesia), then Vietnam.




But as first Trump term come, foreign companies saw a wake up call: like Kissinger predicted, a rising China would cause friction between them and US, a purely economic/military friction instead of ideological like cold war. As pointed out in his book, This friction already ignited back when the common enemy between the two, USSR collapse. Under Deng, Jiang, Hu, the economic and technological baseline of China is weak, the inner political turmoils when communist blocs collapse, ""Obverse carefully, solve the problem calmly, reinforce your position, bid your time, hide your strength, never call yourself leader"" is reasonable, if not necessary for China survival. But when China technology and economy is catching up to the West, the little workers now want to build his own factory to compete with the owner, then this friction to intensify and it take one person like Trump to rip off the diplomatic pretense mask and China would strike back when they feel they have grown up enough. It's especially under Biden, an establishment candidate, represents US political elite, US want to strangle China technology by chip acts, China deemed Trump is not the ""out of the norm"", both US political spectrum is trying to take China down, the difference is only in approach and there's no reason to hold back. And of course, it's just with common sense that if you are doing business between two side, you better find an exit before catching a stray bullet, or as các cụ said ""Trâu bò đánh nhau ruồi muỗi chết"".





That's the subjective reason, the objective reason is Chinese workers wage is not cheap like 90s, 2000s anymore. China is moving away from low value jobs. Assembling mostly is for their own brands which is beating those companies hard since they do everything in-house. So international companies need to move their factories away, South east asia is a good choice as they already manufactured for the west for such a long time, ""know how things works"". And in South East Asia, Vietnam is a good choice. For one, Vietnam has a large young, hardworking workforce, with wage relatively cheap compared to other SEA. Secondly, geographic advantageous position for maritime shipping and Government support for FDI by investing in infrastructures. And lastly, but more important: the political stability. Perk of one party system is the party hold absolute power, so their geopolitical stance would not change suddenly to cause ripple effects ( like Philippine or Australia change in government candidates, cause conflict with China which resulted in economic fallout between two sides). And the geopolitical stance of VCP, the bamboo diplomacy is smart to balance both side to keep trade going.





Investment to manufacture in Vietnam is reasonable but it's not just as easy as it seems. Outside of other reasons explained above, to make manufacturing efficient, you need the supply chain in place. You sew clothes, you need an established fiber industry, an established fabric industry with weaving-dyeing-printing in place. Make plastic toy? Petrochemical, Plastic industry. Certainly, you probably can't get everything in house, for example, advanced IC, complex engine, advanced chemicals that cannot made in Vietnam then you have to import. But other more simple components, like seat or light, wheel, decals of a car should be made locally, because they're in large quantities, if you import, it would add additional cost( delivery and import taxes). 





Only if companies want to stay and invest in long term( 10 years or more), they would establish the supply chain, by either investing in subsidies factories, or profit would encourage local firms to invest to build factories to contracts them. But if Vietnam is in the Trump target, high tariffs or even regulations, ban, it would change the whole calculation. Manufacturing in Vietnam seem unattractive ( like, if Vietnam wage 10% cheaper than Thailand, logistics is 10% more efficient, but tariffs is 46% that Trump can hammer down anytime, why should i do big investment in Vietnam now? Putting too much egg in a basket is bad). They would halt investment into Vietnam, especially for factories that made stuffs for US market. The ripple effect is: workers of those factories lost jobs, contractors of those factories go out of business. Layoffs reduce consumption demand, which in turn reduces domestic investment of firms to serve domestic market, in turn more layoffs. A potential recession in the loom. That's why leadership have to go to Trump first to appease in short term then find other export markets gradually shifting away from US",3,2025-04-16 01:09:17,Oceanshan

Vietjet’s international flights are fine, usually punctual because they can't get away with the same tricks & shiet they pull on their domestic flights.

Unfair practice by Vietjet Domestic Flights:

Don't bother selecting your preferred flight time. You’ll almost never depart at the scheduled time

99% of the time, your flight will be delayed by at least 2 hours.

99% of delays aren’t due to technical issues but rather faked flight schedules open for booking on their website and mobile app. They do this to overbook and then move passengers from overbooked and nonexistent flights to those flights with unfilled seats. You’ll get an SMS and email notification about the schedule change just 24 hours before departure—too late to cancel your flight (as per their T&Cs).

Your Options:
1. Fly with Bamboo Airways (but limited routes and flights).

Vietnam’s economy relies heavily on exports (U.S. is a top market), and tariffs could cut demand. Still, if they boost domestic consumption and pivot to other markets like EU, China, it’s not impossible—tough, but doable. 

2. Tariff impact? Short-term, yes, it’ll slow growth—exports to the U.S. could drop 10-15%, per some estimates. Long-term, Vietnam’s adaptable: they’ve got FTAs (e.g., CPTPP, EVFTA) and can shift supply chains.

I worked in one of these ""international"" schools, one of those which has both countries in its name and which boasts of celebrating/respecting both cultures.

I never once saw a list of student names written in Vietnamese. Only the standard western roman alphabet. No đ, no â,ê, ă, ơ, ư and of course, no tones. So, even those staff who are trying to learn Vietnamese have no idea how to pronounce them.

Does it matter? Of course it does. I met a kid in Y10 for a cover class. When reading the register I hesitated then said ""I'm going to guess this is ""Yung"" right?""  I got a big smile in return and he told me how sick he was of his foreign teachers calling hin ""dung"" - well aware of what it means in English.

It's ignorance, pure and simple. How hard would it be to print a list of names in Vietnamese characters and to give new staff rudimentary lesons in how to pronounce them?

Not even enough respect for the kids and their parents to care about getting their names right.

It's not không chưa, just không or chưa, or vẫn chưa

VietNam,1jwvzud,mmm1dg2,"Vietnamese here.

On the topic of cultural religion:
- Most households have an altar for the local god and our ancestors, sometimes 2 separate altars. We pay respect on the 1st day and the 15th day of the lunar calendar year. 
- We also go to a Buddhist temple on Lunar new year, or visit them throughout the year to pray for health, fortune, etc. Some of the temples are for famous historical figures, too.

=> So we are not strictly Buddhists, just accept Buddhism and follow its teachings. There are also people who follow other religions as well. 

We also don't display our religion on our attire, and men pretty much wear western clothes, unless it's during festivals like Tết, or other special occasions.

Slanted eyes... I mean maybe? But not that slanted eyes per (racist) stereotype. I believe that, on average, our eyes are bigger than counterparts in East Asia (think Japan or Korea)

Move to Europe is also open for interpretation. Does his family come to Europe recently (Say 21st century), or did they move during Cold War? During that era, there was a considerable number of Vietnamese travel to (East) Europe, per request/order from governments to work as ""foreign workers"". Heck, in an extreme level, there are Vietnamese in former Soviet Union in \*\*\*1941\*\*\*, they fought in Battle of Moscow as member of the OMSDON division, I believe.

The connection to culture is interesting... mainly because our own culture is quite diversed and rich (i.e.: between regions) that no Vietnamese can claim that they understand everything. This YouTube video (part 1) is a reasonable primer, I would say

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEU-8AeBBbE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEU-8AeBBbE)

Also, for rock music... This is my personal bias, but can you make a reference to Sabaton? They are a good band from Sweden

>Are vietnamese people religious? What religion do most vietnamese people believe in? Any advice and help would be appreciated, I want to be respectful and connect my oc to his culture 🫶 I have no pictures/drawings of him yet, since he’s not ready.

Not that religious. Spiritual? Yes. Religious? No

I think I read somewhere, about 80% of Vietnamese people are atheist, so there would be no overt influence of religion. However, ""subvert"" influence is true. Generally speaking, Vietnamese are affected by Buddhism, mixed with Taoism and Confucius (the last is more on cultural point of view). The more ""down south"", the more Catholics you would see.

As a rule of thumb, this character would be taught to be respectful to his elders, to his community, and generally avoid confrontations. Furthermore, if situations allow, you can also put altar in his family house. The 1st and 15th day of lunar calendar (so new moon and full moon) would see some small offerings and incense on it. In special scenario, like anniversary of a deceased family member (lunar calendar, usually, but some Catholics would use the Georgian calendar), the whole family might gather for a meal together.

Other than this, there might be one common feature: your dude would be pressured (or guided, at minimum) to be excel in academics.",2,2025-04-12 03:40:46,ConstructionOwn2909
VietNam,1jwvzud,mmogybs,"As a Vietnamese, I would say. Vietnamese mostly follow folk religions (The same case as Japanese follow Shinto). Vietnamese worship many deities, spirits, and great historic figures. Some elements of other religions and ideologies were added to our belief system including but not limited to Spiritualism, Totemism, Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism. Sect of Christianity so far have not been integrated into the wider VNese belief system . IMO don't depict the guy and his family as a devout believer of any religion is a good depiction but ancestors worshiping is a must-have feature. 

Depending on where he and his family came from you can add some differences in personality. People from the north of VN are usually considered to be more strict, formal, articulate, and rigid (heavy influence by Confucianism compared to the rest of the country). People from the middle part of VN tend to be hardworking and more pragmatic than the rest of the country (this is caused by frequent hits by natural disasters every year). People from the South are considered to be more candid, easygoing, and generous.

VNese will be on the shorter side compared to the EU average height (https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/average-height-of-men). VNese follows the East Asian standard of beauty. The lack of sunlight in temperate region can make him less tan as time passes. He can become more tanned after visiting VN once in a while (Ester egg detail for the comic?)",2,2025-04-12 03:45:05,AntOriginal551

Flimsy or non-existent regulations is just the start of it. It barely functions coherently.

Any random can become a Real Estate 'broker' in this country and they lie, mislead and bend the truth like you would not believe.

Also, Vietnam is the only country I've ever lived in where you'll book and pay for an apartment via Agoda or AirBNB, only to receive a message a day later saying 'sorry, we already sold out!' because landlord's will often have 3 or 4 totally separate cowboy brokers listing the same thing at different prices in different places. I was once told by a broker 'I need to cancel your booking. Price listed is too cheap. Sorry sir'

And considering red books (proof of ownership) appear to be optional, or provided years and years later if at all, you could not pay me to buy an apartment in this country.

VietNam,1jspkzy,mlqdc2o,"Been through this. As commentor said you can get the morphine prescribed for 10 days, but the paperwork is the pita. 

The viet really know how to make a miserable situation even worse, the care is so callous and indifferent. 

Probably spent ~80k$ in 2 years at the international boutique hospitals in order to avoid that, only to be steered in the wrong direction by a doctor who doesn't specialize in your particular area of oncology as the staff is limited. 

But you'll eventually end up at a large state hospital like cho ray anyway as that's the only place they have all the necessary treatments and medications on hand. And eventual on the 5th floor of building D to the joke they call the palliative unit, then you will experience the sheer extent of the misery of being a patent in vn.  

The most frustrating thing is the fact that these patients need sleep! But it's loud as fuck cuz your stuck in a room with 8 viet hillbillies all yelling on the phone or watching YouTube at an obnoxious volume.  5 needs in a small room, patients sleeping in the hall, there are no private rooms. Then someone will busy out some fermented  foul smelling lday old meal as the patients are nauseated from chemo. Some will even be smoking right outside the room with patients on ventilators. Doctors and nurses remind me of field medics whove seen it all and just drained of compassion. Real 3rd world shit happens here. 

Yet people in this sub talking how cheap and wonderful healthcare in vn is, they've haven't lived long enough and are too ignorant to know better. Vn isn't a place to have any serious illnesses, but 100 million people don't have a choice.

Get yourself a 24 hour caregiver, about 15 million a month. 600$, as they will require a assistant when at the hospital.",6,2025-04-06 17:46:51,TheEvilGenious
