Most modern war movies portray soldiers as either snot-nosed kids who've never experienced the real world or hardened warriors who only know how to kill and not much else. But Captain Miller? He was just a teacher. A regular guy, living a regular life who ended up thousands of miles from home fighting through the history's largest armed conflict hoping to get back to his wife.

CHEECH & CHONG’S LAST MOVIE – Exclusively in Theaters Friday 4/25 🥦

Their multicultural, irreverent humor turned them into icons, counterculture rock stars, and Hollywood legends. How did Cheech and Chong ignite imaginations and stay relevant over 50 years? Join them for one last ride to find out... and bring a bud!

His newest film, **Until Dawn**, is out in theaters nationwide next weekend.

> One year after her sister disappeared, Clover and her friends head to the remote valley where she vanished to search for answers. Exploring an abandoned visitor center, they soon encounter a masked killer who murders them one by one. However, when they mysteriously wake up at the beginning of the same night, they're forced to relive the terror over and over again.

It's directed by David F. Sandberg (/u/dauid), director of **Lights Out**, **Annabelle: Creation**, and both **Shazam!** films.

Mr. Garland: Huge fan of your work and just rewatched Sunshine this weekend. Absolutely beautiful storytelling. Absolutely *tight* storytelling. 

Can you shed a little bit of light on your process for hewing these big ideas—Ex Machina, Annihilation, Civil War, Sunshine—down to very character-driven and lean stories? I don’t know if it’s instinct or the hard work of 50 drafts, but there’s seemingly no bloat or meandering, no endless subplots or wasted moves.

Do you go full bore and write 300 pages of exploration, then whittle it down to perfection? Or is it a much more deliberate, almost intellectual or academic, exercise? (I think it was Faulkner who said he never started actually writing a new story until he knew exactly where every word and punctuation was going to be.)

Thanks again for doing this. Civil War was a riveting experience in theaters and I can’t wait to see Warfare.",30,2025-04-08 12:58:07,Dottsterisk
movies,1jucgre,mm110ov,"Hi Alex and Ray! Thank you for doing this, can’t wait to watch Warfare.

I wanted to ask - from what I understand, you didn’t actually audition actors for this movie, but instead interviewed them. What were you looking for in those interviews? What was your criteria when you decided who to cast in Warfare? 

You assembled such an accomplished cast of up-and-comers, and it seems like they managed to form a great camaraderie, so you obviously did something right.

movies,1jucgre,mm27602,"I've seen the film -- it's great. One detail I noticed is that, despite the amount of lead the Americans were throwing downrange, it was never clear whether they were actually hitting anyone. As far as I can recall, there wasn't a single clear shot of an ""enemy combatant"" being struck by a bullet. The only time it seemed the Americans were *definitely* hitting their targets, was during one or two overhead drone shots, and that footage was distant (and infrared to boot). This is so different from most other war movies that I imagine it was an intentional decision. If it was, can you talk about your thought process? Thanks.",23,2025-04-08 16:45:20,KMOX
movies,1jucgre,mm3a6kq,"Hi Alex and Ray, these are for either or both of you. 



First off, thank you so much for doing this. I was able to see the film last night at Lincoln Square and was floored. To my questions: 

* A lot has been made of the lack of a score in the film, both in how a score can influence the audience and in how it brought the sound design to the fore. Watching the film, I was struck by how the radio chatter was the score of the film. The audience hears the communication as if they are wearing the ComTacs. The radio only goes silent in moments when the characters are losing control/ not doing their job (I.e., not covering their sectors, not moving the wounded two rooms into the house). I felt the scene where the comms jack is unplugged underlined this. In making the film, how did you perceive the importance of the comms to the structure of the film? 
* Alex, in the Q&A, you briefly mentioned Platoon as another war film that was made by a combat veteran (and heavily invested in its authenticity). While Warfare is certainly unique amongst war films, what films or other media did you look to while working on the film, if any? 
* One of the things that I feel reviews of the film are bumping up against is that we have not quite figured out how to tell a war story about an all-volunteer military (that is less than 1% of the population). It lacks those universal elements that can exist in a unit of draftees that the audience can hold onto (Platoon certainly comes to mind here). Especially with a unit of SEALs, you are depicting professionals, and the military is a career. Watching the film, especially in the lulls before and between contact, I couldn’t help but view it as a workplace drama more than anything else. Did you think about this at all in the filmmaking process?  
* You alluded to this in the Q&A, but I wanted to ask directly: The movie is based on memories, but were Iraqis who were present that day, either in the house or fighters, interviewed for the film? 
*  Lastly, for Ray. Is it driving you crazy that every review of the film refers to SEALs as soldiers? ",18,2025-04-08 19:53:24,Metropolitan296
movies,1jucgre,mm1jq5d,"For Mr. Mendoza:

There’s been a long and ongoing conversation about how to responsibly depict war on film.

Glorifying the war and violence itself is problematic, they say, but you also don’t want to discount the personal bravery and sacrifice of the men and women who are actually there on the ground—and most often not exactly of their choosing. They may have signed up of their own accord, but soldiers don’t decide when the country goes to war, where they’re deployed or what their precise missions are, so blaming individual soldiers for the decisions of politicians and higher-ups is patently unfair.

What are your thoughts on this dilemma? How do you do justice to the individuals and their actions—what they do for *each other,* the soldier next to them—without making war itself seem exciting?

Are there any films or shows that you think did an exceptional job of capturing this complicated reality?

Thank you for your time. Looking forward to the film.",35,2025-04-08 14:49:13,Dottsterisk
movies,1jucgre,mm1qare,"Civil War was my favorite movie of last year!  I'm really excited for Warfare and 28 Years Later this year.

For Alex,

\- Being a Pittsburgh native, I really liked the ""Go Steelers"" graffiti in Civil War (and I always notice that before the hanging bodies in the background).  I think that's a pretty cool shot.  Was that in the script, or was that something that was figured out while shooting?

\- I watched most of your talk with Neil Druckmann.  I'm a big fan of The Last of Us, so I'm pretty excited you said 28 Years Later has a similar story (with the characters trying to get somewhere during the zombie apocalypse).  If you could adapt any videogame (other than The Last of Us), which one would you adapt?

For Ray,

\- I'm a little less familiar with your work, but I was looking through your IMDb credits and I have a seen a few of the movies you've worked on (I even saw a Gofobo advance screening of Act of Valor, so that was a nice memory).  I was wondering what it's like to be a military advisor on a movie?  Was it challenging to make the transition to director?

Hi, I’m Peter Cattaneo, director of The Penguin Lessons, starring Steve Coogan. Inspired by a true story, the film takes place in 1976 Argentina, on the eve of a political revolution, where a teacher and his students at an exclusive boys school are enlightened by an unusual guest.

movies,1jkaor7,mju7hbb,"Hi Peter, 

Recently caught The Full Monty again on TV recently and was struck by how ahead of its time it was in terms of dealing with issues that many men often have to live with but are afraid to discuss.

Many films will either hide or make light of these issues but the film manages to deal with depression, suicide, body image/confidence, financial pressure, unemployment, sexuality, friendship, struggles of fatherhood (including shared custody) and the sense of belonging without ever feeling heavy handed or judgemental.

I was just wondering if you ever received memorable notes of thanks from people/groups struggling with these problems or if you received any bizarre backlash from others for highlighting them?

My question:

It looked like everyone involved was having so much fun making the film. How did you engineer a set environment where everyone felt comfortable, especially given the subject matter?

movies,1jlkd7q,mkf1pkz,"One thing I’ve noticed about Jenna Ortega. I think she’s a talented actress, but she doesn’t have the ability to elevate sub-par material. Just like with Beetlejuice 2, they literally give her nothing to work with here, and results in just flat delivery.  
more glaringly obvious here, juxtaposed with the complete opposite Paul Rudd. His whole character is a nothing burger, but he’s got this skill to make thin air compelling.  
Really everyone in this movie suffers from not being written at all. Like they had a premise only, and just populated the movie with stock characters to serve it. I know the whole pseudo monologue she gives trying to sway the family from using the unicorn is played off as them not hearing her, but *i* as the audience member should get where she’s going. It’s her big scene and it’s just a bunch of “I don’t know, it’s just bad! Uh You know?” I was with the family going, wait what?  
Lastly it’s criminal to have Anthony Carrigan to just have him basically stand around in the background the whole time. He wasn’t in any trailers, I was like ‘oh what an unexpected treat!’ When I saw him. He could’ve so easily done an eccentric manservant thing and injected a little life into this, but they just wasted him.  
It’s a serviceable little popcorn movie, but it feels like mostly filler. It’s not blowing anybody away, or reaching the level of movies it’s trying to emulate like Ready or Not",73,2025-03-29 21:14:45,Expensive_Editor_244

movies,1jkufoq,mjybxt9,"The issue is price. In this instance, Looney Tunes compilations are dirt cheap. For a lot of other media: It can be expensive as hell.

For example: I mostly have Max to watch Doctor Who. I buy it for a month or two once a year to rewatch it, and watch a bunch of other movies and shows in between. Ad blockers work, so its 10-20 dollars a year.  The Doctor Who Blu Rays sell for, last I checked a few weeks ago, 260-300 or so dollars. It would take me re-watching Doctor Who once a year for over 20 years to match that price. Even if you go full price for no ads, thats 20 bucks a year and would take 10+ years to get close. Even if it was 30+ a month, itd take almost the same time.

Same with the MCU. Its nearly thousands of dollars, to get the entire saga on blu ray. Or you can pay 7 dollars a month for disney+ with an ad blocker.

Similarly Jackie Chan, and especially the stunt men working with Jackie Chan take some falls that don't even look survivable.  The fight in the rope factory in Miracles (aka Mr Canton and Lady Rose) is one in particular where there's several falls that look like they should be an automatic trip to the hospital.

movies,1jt29gu,mlrc0j0,"- the premise made no sense. The logistics of how a small amount of animals managed to maintain a breeding population, expand across fucking oceans to other continents, and dominate to the point of being just an ordinary every day encounter across the planet within the span of just 4 years is absolutely laughable. It was like *maybe* 50-100 animals of dozens of different species with only a small handful of each species at that auction. Not to mention, I'm pretty sure all of the large animals were GPS chipped so it would have been very easy for the military to track down and eliminate them well before they could start breeding and become an ecological disaster that takes over the global food chain. The only species that might have been an issue would have been the small ones like compies so yeah, those would likely just be a thing now. 
- they re-use the idiotic ""dinosaurs as military super weapons"" shit again and manage to make it even dumber. Oh, you point a laser at something and the raptor goes and kills it? You know what else you can point at something and kill it with way fewer steps and opportunities for error? A fucking *gun*.
- it continues to treat dinosaurs as these powerful unkillable god creatures. They're animals. Still dangerous but firepower will still definitely work on them and literally any military in the world could easily stop them.
- it was a *dinosaur* movie that chose to instead focus on *locusts*
- bringing back Dodgson to be the main villain made no real sense and had no impact. For movie only people, nobody even knew who Dodgson was because he was in the first movie for less than 5 minutes, had like 3 lines, and his role as a renowned (albeit extremely sketchy) geneticist wasn't even mentioned. They just thought he was a corporate spy. Not to mention, they didn't even get his original actor back so he looked nothing like his appearance in JP so that's even less reason for anyone to realize that was supposed to be the same guy.  For book readers, his ""evil Steve Jobs"" esque portrayal in Dominion wasn't even anything like his character in the books. He may as well have just been a completely different character and it would have made no difference to anyone. 
- the original JP cast was brought back purely for nostalgia bait as they had no actual plot significance and did nothing that literally any other character could have done. 


It was just a mess of a movie with stupid ideas, terrible writing, bad acting, etc. and existed only to cash in on the IP.

Upon investigation, it was a diversion that was a prelude to a series of wild actions planned by the heir to a global pharmaceutical conglomerate (portrayed by Kaneshiro), which ends up with his own father, the founder of the family conglomerate and possible drug baron, killed in hospital. A mission to declare a war on drugs is declared but has the result of throwing the world – and the underworld – into chaos.

Hong Kong's most expensive film. Shot way back in 2018.

movies,1jm3ocu,mk920ip,"I often think of the screen grab ""What are you doing?"" that's written on the bathroom stall.  Like... I think of it a lot.

I don't ""fit in"" to whatever ""this"" is but I can't seem to carve out whatever it is I really want because I don't know what it is I really want, and then I punish myself for that and end up in this neverending loop of guilt and shame.  And *then* I feel bad about it.  And all the while time is tickin' and life is happening, it's just not happening to me.  I'm riding the ether until my clock runs out.

It feels like a big ""F"" in terms of a way a person goes through life, and even worse, knowing it and not knowing what to do about it.

You don't want to be a cog in the machine and be a whore for the game but your very existence is cost prohibitive if you think about it too long unless you find a way to benefit mankind that isn't commercially motivated.  Agenda-dedless standard of living to a wishful nirvana in a morally bankrupt world that you're forced to be apart of.

It's a movie about being a runner up to a Shakespeare, in life. That's not something that gets written about much. So you feel a bit bad for the guy....but you also kinda see why he's losing out to someone else.

It's a movie where you find out you are even going to lose out to the Justin Timberlakes of the world when you had real talent. So yeah, that makes you feel weird ways.",10,2025-03-29 04:02:10,UnicornCalmerDowner

More information:

Hi r/movies – I'm Fleur Fortuné, the director of THE ASSESSMENT, in theaters now from Magnolia Pictures. Starring Alicia Vikander, Elizabeth Olsen, Himesh Patel, and Minnie Driver, the film had its World Premiere at TIFF 2024, and played at the Zurich Film Festival, BFI London Film Festival, and more. The film is my feature directorial debut, but I've been directing music videos (like some for Skrillex, Drake, Pharrell Williams, and Travis Scott), commercials, and shorts until now. More on the film:

THE ASSESSMENT follows Mia (Olsen) and Aaryan (Patel), a successful couple who hope to become parents in a near future where resources are extremely limited and the government keeps firm control over reproduction. They are assigned an assessor named Virginia (Vikander), who moves into their home for seven days to evaluate whether they deserve to move forward in their parenting journey. What Mia and Aaryan are hoping is a routine test quickly unravels into a psychological nightmare, forcing them to question the very foundations of their society and what it truly means to be human.

THE ASSESSMENT is now in theaters, and you can check out screenings in your area here:

Well, that depends. It's basically like this:

1. 35mm: runs down.
2. VistaVision: same as \[1\] but runs side-to-side
3. 65mm: runs down
4. IMAX: same as \[3\] but runs side-to-side

It has a similar effect to watching a widescreen video on your phone: when you switch to landscape mode, the picture area suddenly gets a lot bigger.

He shows up in the beginning, goes missing for most of the movie, then shows up at the beginning of the third act to tell the Rami Malek there's no going back, only for Rami Malek to manage to go back to his normal life in the end. Also Laurence Fishburne's character showing up in the epilogue to essentially say ""Proud of you, kiddo"" despite trying to kill him for most of the movie was also a headscratcher.",140,2025-04-11 03:00:28,Lonely-Freedom4986

Malek is playing nerdy Jason Bourne essentially and shoutout to Holt McCallany for playing scum/ shady person in every single thing I’ve seen him in. Too many actors are wasted here. The biggest offenders being Laurence Fishburne and Jon Bernthal who are way too under utilized. Especially Bernthal who is too good of an actor to still be getting casted in these bit roles.

I also don’t buy the last scene with Laurence Fishburne’s character; it seems like at least one scene with him is missing. 

But this is easily the most I’ve liked Rami Malek in a movie, and I found a few scenes to be surprisingly emotional. I find Rachel Brosnahan to be very endearing in a rather thankless part, which makes me excited to see what she does as Lois Lane.",89,2025-04-11 02:47:38,Busy-Effect2026

movies,1jwev63,mmhumh2,"I really wish this movie was better. As someone who is so tired of the ""messed with the wrong guy"" movies, this seemed like it had potential to be a little different. And it is a *little* different, and for that I was thankful. But it fails to really elevate and overall makes some strange choices. 

Rami Malek, despite being the main character and the producer, is far from the most interesting part of this movie, and that's kind of a shame. He's a classic under estimated character, but his tick is that he can't pull a trigger. Yet he has no problem pushing a button on his phone to blow someone up or drop them off a building. The movie does engage with this idea a little, a couple characters monologue about the cognitive dissonance involved to go one but not the other, but the movie doesn't dig into it enough. 

The supporting cast is really what lends this movie legitimacy. Laurence Fishburne, Holt McCallany, and a surprise third acgt Michael Stuhlberg really up the value here. All very in-the-pocket, not doing anything surprising but doing what's asked of them well. Jon Bernthal shows up for a role that is seemingly useless sequel bait, and it's just an odd choice because this movie already feels so much like The Accountant which comes out in two weeks. Rachel Brosnahan is also in this running the gamut of dead wife flashbacks, totally under utilized. 

Speaking of which, was anyone else certain that she would end up not being dead? It really feels like this movie sets that up really hard. You only ever see her death on CCTV cameras and there's a lot of ""no point in asking questions, we (the clandestine organization that trades in lies and secrets) are saying she's dead so she's dead"" when it happens. Not to mention there's a whole plot in this movie where Malek figures out how to manipulate live CCTV footage to put his face on people all over the globe and throw off the CIA. I was excitedly waiting for the conspiracy reveal that she's alive or even in on it, and for him to have already figured that out and planned for it. But no, none of that. It honestly feels like something was cut because the ending is just him tricking the big bad into getting arrested. 

Overall, I could see what this was going for, and maybe with a better script that is more surprising in the ways Malek uses his ""abilities"" this could have been a low key banger. But as it is he's just a natural wiz at making on-the-fly pipe bombs and a pretty solid problem solver. They could have leaned more into people starting to fear him, into the difference between pushing a button and pulling the trigger, and bigger into the conspiracy aspects. But sadly it all felt way underbaked. 6/10 for me, a positive score because if we have to get 10 movies like this a year this is the tone and attempt I prefer, but if they do run with a sequel it has a lot to improve upon.

movies,1jrbhl6,mldeq7z,"Hey Alex!  I saw the movie last night and really enjoyed it!  Im curious about the CGI.  The reported budget was 15 million and there is a good amount of CGI.  Was it tough to incorporate the amount of CGI used in this movie within that budget (if it's accurate)? I hope we see more smaller budgeted movies that can use CGI as effectively as this movie did to help convey the story, and stay relatively on the lower cost end.

Also Will Poulter was hilarious.  There must be some fun outtakes from set.

Thanks!

A big problem is the cost. Whilst many of these new projectors increase picture quality, light and energy saving - they still don’t last usually longer than 10-13 years. And the average person really doesn’t care about the differences - so you can’t really charge more per ticket.

So companies are even less likely to make these upgrades. New sites or places in Saudi which are opening ridiculously huge lavish cinemas will though.

We are reaching a point where many theatres/cinemas have already just gone through an upgrade process as it’s been well over a decade since the big digital change over (at least in the UK) and the equipment was old, bugged and the energy saving from newer models made the past few words has been needed.",8,2025-03-25 11:57:05,setokaiba22

Im not saying it would be great, but I doubt it’s worse than what we got. From what we know, at least Ayer’s version had an actual edit and score by Steven Price, as opposed to the weird neon flashbacks set to pop songs

* Suicide Squad sucked, but I'd be down to watch his Ayer cut for sure.

I have not seen the rest of his movies. I will say I'd enjoy some bad/fun Statham movie, but I feel it is not the same excitement I had for the guy after his first few movies.

This AMA has been verified by the mods. Jeremy and Michael will be back at 4 PM ET today to answer any questions.

Information from the filmmakers:

Hey Reddit,

We are Jeremy Workman (director) and Michael Townsend (film subject) from the new doc SECRET MALL APARTMENT. Part heist movie and part rallying cry against corporate overlords, the film tells the wild story of Michael and seven other artists creating an apartment inside the busy Providence Place Mall.

The film had a huge opening last weekend in Providence - at the mall itself! - and opens today in New York at the IFC Center. It expands to other cities Friday.

Here's our trailer: https://youtu.be/B9OCYOD-e9s?si=QlISDHyVyCx8ZW0V

Without a robust marketing campaign, it's due to fail at the box office. Same thing is happening to The Alto Knights, a great film nobody heard of because of poor marketing.",11,2025-03-26 17:32:32,cineaste2
movies,1jkfptq,mk1gj1p,"the trailer looked intriguing and the movie definitely delivered, i appreciated the fact that it was conceptual, but also plot-driven and definitely seemed to move to its own beat which is hard to find these days and generally 

i think the only thing that i would make some points about (which ill say is something that i only do if i ended up being a fan of the movie) is how the ending turned out to be unnecessarily long and overly explanatory where we ended up seeing each character's journey, i somewhat understand why they did this at least with aria's and mia's, whereas with the assessor it turned into the movie almost hitting us over the head in order to establish the plot points 

apart from that, solid film, appreciated how futuristic, dystopian it was, without being overtly topical and commenting on current politics, while still delving into real world topics unapologetically

James is also the co-founder of Focus Features and is a three-time Oscar Nominee (Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Original Song for **Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon** and Best Picture for **Brokeback Mountain**)

> His output includes writing or co-writing The Ice Storm, Eat, Drink, Man, Woman, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Hulk (all directed by Ang Lee), and producing Brokeback Mountain and Alone in Berlin. At Focus he oversaw the production and distribution of Lost in Translation, Milk, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Coraline, and The Kids Are All Right.

Andrew also directed two other critically-acclaimed films, **Driveways** (2019) and **Fire Island** (2022)

Information from the filmmakers:

-------------------------------------------------------------------

We will be back tomorrow Wednesday 4/17 at 3:00 PM ET to answer your questions.

We are Andrew Ahn (co-writer/director) and James Schamus (co-writer/producer) of THE WEDDING BANQUET— a deeply personal, sharply funny, and emotionally rich reimagining of Ang Lee’s beloved 1993 classic.

Here is the trailer:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWy_IzW04YM

Together, we bring decades of filmmaking experience to the table! James is an Oscar-nominated screenwriter and producer behind films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Brokeback Mountain, The Ice Storm, and the original version of The Wedding Banquet. Andrew is a Sundance-winning director whose work like Spa Night, Driveways, and Fire Island explores identity, intimacy, and family, both those we’re born with and those we choose for ourselves, with heart and nuance.

This new version of The Wedding Banquet reflects the world we live in now — from universal, evolving ideas of family and tradition, to the complexities of queer Asian American identity. We’ve poured our hearts into this project, and we’re thrilled to share it with you!

Want to know about the making of this film, what it means to update a classic, or how two storytellers came together to collaborate? Ask us anything.

movies,1k1ccsy,mnl7w1l,"Hey Andrew & James. Thanks for doing this.

As someone who loves the original Wedding Banquet, one of the things that makes that screenplay stand out is that the premise feels primed for 'cheap' humor & the movie refuses to cash in on it. Like if I explained the premise to someone who had never seen it, naturally they would expect hijinks around the parents being constantly on the verge of discovering the 'secret'. But the movie shines because it is more interested in the personal/cultural dynamics at play rather than the parents accidentally walking into the wrong room & someone needing to hide behind a door (or whathaveyou). 

Was this something you kept in mind when writing the new screenplay? Was it something you had to push back on with the studio? 

Thanks again! (PS - James I think Eat, Drink, Man, Woman is a true capital M Masterpiece & I just wanted to say **thank you** for that in particular. It is an all-time favorite of mine.)",10,2025-04-17 14:19:51,Michael__Pemulis

Andrew, were you a fan of the original growing up, or was it a film you discovered later on? Did you use the original a lot as a reference point or did you prefer to do something different? Was it intimating adapting a classic Ang Lee film for a more modern audience?

Despite the completion of filming in 2018, it has undergone a sluggish post-production process, [highlighted by long rumored tensions between director Juno Mak and members of the cast, particularly Kaneshiro and Richie Jen](https://www.todayonline.com/8days/sceneandheard/entertainment/takeshi-kaneshiro-reportedly-feuded-director-movie-which-had-its), whose name has been  absent from recent promotional material, leading to speculation that his scenes may have been cut from the film.  The legendary Japanese music composer Ryuichi Sakamoto was hired to score the film, but he passed away before being able to fully complete his work due to this hiatus, forcing Mak to finish his work with help from Nate Connelly. Originally budgeted at HK$150 million, it has now blown out to HK$400 million thanks to continuous reshootings of scenes and other post-production work, making it the most expensive production in Hong Kong cinema history, surpassing 2023 film the Goldfinger's $350 million. Mak is said to have cut 2-hour, 3-hour and 6-hour versions of the movie and actor Louis Koo said yesterday at the Hong Kong International Film Festival that he had seen a 4-hour cut of the film, but it remains to be seen what version will officially premiere at Cannes next month.",5,2025-04-11 17:29:51,Adventurous_Caramel

> About the film, Steve Goldman writes: ""Les Goldman was my father. Creating this film was one of the most important accomplishments of his life. He was inspired to make this film after hearing the poem 'Hangman' read on Pacifica Radio in Los Angeles by Les Claypool. My father almost single-handedly raised the money to make the film, with $100 and $200 donations from friends and associates. Paul Julian, Serge Hovey, and Herschel Bernardi were friends and colleagues of my father. He elicited their help in making the film. Though the poem on which the film is based has Holocaust parallels, the poet, Maurice Ogden, was actually writing about America during the McCarthy era. Ogden was an actor and writer who was denied work and persecuted by the House Un-American Activities Committee during the 1950's and early 60's for allegedly having been a member of the Communist Party many years earlier.""

Both Boiling Point and Adolescence are actual real one takes with no hidden cuts. Which IMO makes it so much more impressive.

Edit 2: Also I gotta add that how Barantini and crew paced and filmed the episodes and the film really makes you feel like you are ""trapped"" in them and are sort of forced to experience these really tense moments. Like you can't look away.",16,2025-04-15 11:44:41,frangeek_

movies,1k0wubp,mnik017,"I liked your thought about erasing Joel's trauma by hiding Clem in those memories, I had never thought about that angle before - and I think your theory works IF the last scene in the movie ended in ""okay"".

But it doesn't. Why else would Kaufman show that beach scene repeating if they lived happily ever after? (And I'd be intrested in hearing a reason why, I'm pretty sure I'm in the minority who thinks this) To me, it shows that Joel and Clem aren't right for each other, and they never will be. They need to go through that breakup process to move on and they never do.

movies,1k55hxq,mofec0y,"I saw this on another thread, but basically he's a working actor. Like if you're producing a movie and have the money he's a pretty easy hire.

movies,1k55hxq,mofg3o6,"There was a big shift in Hollywood around the time he was coming through, and I think he was ill fitted for the type of leading man that came to represent ""New Hollywood"".

I think he might have become an A-lister in a very different sort of Hollywood, one that stayed closer to its roots in theatre. He's not a naturalistic or subtle actor IMO, his style screams ""Quiet on set! The actor will begin acting now!"" I think his style comes more from that early British classical Shakespearean scene that would have him as the tortured and melodramatic protagonist, with Brian Blessed supporting as Falstaff or something like that. Big acting, big emotions, because there's no camera lingering inches from his face to register subtle facial expressions.

Alternatively, I think if he had come along ten years later, he might have fallen in with someone like David Lynch, who was very much trying to counter program the dominant Hollywood style at the time.",12,2025-04-22 13:37:39,CCLF
