- ra: ""z"" like ""zoom"" in the north (inconsistently), ""wr"" like ""wrong"" in the south
- sa: ""s"" like ""sound"" in the north, ""sh"" like ""shy"" in the south

However as a general experience:
- everybody understands the north accent because this is the accent on TV
- you'll never understand a sentence that you've ""learnt at school"", just because the grammar have many variants so they'll never use the sentence that you've learnt. You'll probably get the glimpse of some words.

\- Do not wear luxurious looking jewelries, even the fake ones;  
\- Mind your belongings and surrounding in the crowd;  
\- Trust you instinct, if you sense being scammed, just say no and walk away, or you can ask for help from the locals walking by;  
\- In case there's no visible price sign, ask the staff;

I'd recommend staying in the Old Quarter in Hanoi, a good amount of tourists are around there including lots of female travellers, and there's heaps to do and see - make sure you get egg coffee and the pho, it's next level tasty.

And just FYI, I am a tournament chess player myself, played in rated events. You absolutely do not say 'check', it is in fact bad etiquette to do so.

In chess you don't 'trap' the king. The king needs to be in check and have no legal moves left to win. Your wording is ambiguous but what you're describing sounds like a stalemate.

You would never say check to your opponent in any competitive setting. The opponent could complain to an arbiter that you are being distracting or unsportsmanlike and you could get penalized if you keep doing it. 

If the opponent is in check and makes and illegal move because they don't realize they're in check then extra time gets added on for the person not in check. I believe doing that twice in a game is an immediate loss. Because of this, it would be stupid to inform your opponent that they're in check — you're only hurting yourself.

We got the train to Hue from Da Nang which was an amazing experience, definitely recommend.  It's a very scenic route with great views, takes about 2.5 hours I think and is quite cheap. We stayed in Hue 3 nights, because we wanted to see more architecture etc. We spent 1 day visiting the tombs, and 1 day for the ancient citadel.

moaj3ae,1k4htrr,reddit,"Hey, big foodie and Vietnamese here. Ignore Albertqwe’s advice, lol. Avoid HCMC, there is a new traffic law that makes traversing the city very hard if you’re only there for a short time. Also, the food in Saigon is honestly very touristy and has a sweeter palate even the locals don’t value. The city is known for broken rice and sweeter pho which is in pretty much every city internationally, I.e. that bowl of pho that you liked in California or Toronto is going to taste very similar to a bowl of pho in Saigon. If you really want to experience food in Vietnam, first know that each city In the south and in the north specializes in their own unique dishes. From your itinerary, I would recommend dishes to try from each area. Da Nang has been one of the most popular food destinations for all of my friends. Bánh xèo, Mì Quảng, Bún mắm are very famous dishes to try while you’re there but even the Bánh mì and the  Bún bò will taste great. Huế is special and is very famous for their take on Bún bò, which is why it’s internationally famous as Bún bò Huế. They have amazing other specialties in seafood specifically with shellfish, specifically with crab, shrimp, and clams so dishes like rice with clams and crab broth noodles are spiced with their shrimp paste. Hội An is really known as a trading port so anything shopping I’d really spend most of my time there! There are amazing restaurants in Hội An that specialize in snails and fish so be sure to try some too! Always stick to food recommendations by locals and you will find the hidden gems of Vietnam. I would spend more time in DN, Huế and Hội An in that order. At most 1-2 days in HCMC.",2025-04-21 17:56:49,4,pinaptran,VietNam

Saigon:

- Visit the lotus fountain

mnwklkq,1k2ru7e,reddit,We were in Ninh Binh area three weeks ago (mid 60s). Do the boat trip from Trang An which is a must rather than Tam Coc as vendors etc. aren't allowed there so it's more peaceful. Number 3 is through the longest cave.

And dangerous in wet weather which it wasn't thankfully for us. Get a Grab to Trang An and back (and everywhere in fact). Bich Dong Pagoda is very nice as is Bai Dinh Pagoda although most buildings there are more recently constructed.  The advantage there is you can take golf style buggies from point to point if you buy the more expensive ticket.  The site is absolutely huge.

mnu5bfb,1k2fqqm,reddit,"Ok, here's how I do it if I plan to go without a rice cooker: 


1. Pre-wash rice until water is about 50% clear of starch. 


2. Finger method for amount of water to add. (Honestly, you can go slightly over with the pot method because of Step 4.)


3. Put on high heat and come to boil with lid off (to prevent overflow). Continue to stir frequently to prevent sticking/burning to the bottom.


4. Continue to keep on high and stir until water has about 85% boiled off. The rice in the pot should be plump, look like ""dry"" congee, and continue to produce bubbles. When you stir the rice, it takes 1-2 sec for the rice to return to its previous shape. (E.g. you can see the after effects of how you stir your rice for a brief sec.) You can continue to cook the water down if you like your rice dry. I personally like soft rice, so I'll turn the heat down to low here and pop the lid on.


5. Keep on low for several minutes. I kinda eyeball it here. Maybe 8-10 min? I just pop the lid off, fluff the rice, and if it has the consistency I like, I turn off the heat and let it settle on its own with the heat on until I'm ready to serve.

At that time, I'm tasked with sourcing the Indian flour and all kinds of indian spices which is hard to find and expensive then. So if you stick to Indian cuisine, maybe Vietnam is not that foodily friendly compared to Singapore or Malaysia. 

The Vietnamese doesn't hide their body shaming attitude. If someone is over weight, they'll say that someone is fat. If someone smells, they will take some steps away. But Vietnamese are not expert in culture and race, we can never tell an Indian from a Pakistan or Bangladesh or a Singaporean of Indian decend. And we have nothing against India or Indian people. Previously lots of Indian movies are shown on TV where the actors dance all the time even during the fighting which is a good image. Now that at my beach in Danang, maybe half of the foreigners I meet are Indian.  
  
So you'd have no worry about your landlord. At your level, you can always asked for your company's admin department to help you to find accomodations or even provided by your company (or deduct the rent from your income). That way the company enjoyed expense (which means less profit and less tax to pay), VAT which is also deductble and you don't have to deal directly with the landlord if you don't want to. To the landlord, as long as you behave like a normal dweller and he/she got the money, she's fine.

Vietnamese people are very friendly and personable. Please don't let stories from the internet scare you. If you smile and are open, you should rarely find discrimination. In those rare times when a Vietnamese person is unkind, please forgive them for they do not know who you are but still judge. That is a sign of their lack of compassion. 

I would like the share something that might not be mentioned on social media. The Indian accent when speaking English can be harder for Vietnamese people to understand because our tones are contrasting. So sometimes there is an awkwardness. But don't let that bother you. Also, there are always translation apps. And if you can greet people in Vietnamese, you automatically earn 20 points of goodwill. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)

So, please don't let that discourage you. You will find many Vietnamese people who are kind and only treat you as a human. (Though Vietnamese also respect buying power, so they are not ignoring you, the person, when that happens. Just cultural and historical issues.)

I know two guys of Indian origin (US and UK) that lived in Vietnam for over half a decade and they were treated well, had pretty colorful dating lives, and enjoyed living in the country aside from the pollution and work culture. 

That being said, I do scour Vietnamese Facebook pages and groups from time to time and I do see some anti-Indian posts with a lot of questionable. if not downright hateful comments. Those people won't say those things to your face though, I can guarantee that. Because, again, most locals are pretty polite with non-locals. 

As for Indian travelers being chased away from restaurants, that is pretty unhinged. To give my own personal anecdote, I'm Black (Senegalese-American) and have never been denied entry into any restaurant.

From what I’ve read out of your replies to other people you seem to be a very well traveled and open minded person. the Indian tourists here are often very conservative, like to stick to their own community, and refuse to eat anything but strictly eat Indian vegetarian food. Viet people don’t like stingy and difficult folks in general that’s why. We are just down to earth and we like to chill.

During the daytime though, if Vietnamese women are outdoors they are covered head to toe in sunblocking garments and accessories usually in a variety of tiny floral prints.

Younger women tend to wear oversized hoodies and wide legged jeans or sweatpants as their daytime sun cover.

Ninh Binh city itself isn't where you'd want to stay — it's between Tam Coc (a bit more developed tourist town) or Trang An (more rural). Both have their pros and cons depending on what you're looking for.

Yesterday, we did the Mua Cave hike and the views were phenomenal. I've been to Lauterbrunnen and Palawan and this place is up there with those IMO.  

The hike 500 steps up and can get brutal at times. Stoned edged stairs that can get super steep and sketchy but you see older and younger people do it and it motivates ya. Theres rest points and even small stands selling water. 

Keep in mind that while Ninh Binh is still less touristy than many places, it is growing in popularity, especially in Asia, so i definitely suggest arriving to anything early.

We heard great things about the Trang An tour — route 3, specifically and we chose it and loved every second. It has the longest cave (about 1km and it was just incredible!!!) The whole boat tour was about 2 hours and we arrived around 8:30am just in time to beat the crowd. If you can arrive earlier, even better! We just arrived early and bought our tickets there. $10 a person for 4 people total on a boat! They pair you with others if you are just 1 or 2 or a private tour is around $50, I believe.

Getting in and out of the boat can be challenging and a bit scary at first for anyone with disabilities but it depends on the mobility issue. I personally think it's worth it! we also love our hotel. here to help if you need any more help planning your trip! I've been to Da Nang, Hoi An and Hanoi tmrw!

I saw a youtuber say that if you do 1 boat tour he doesn't feel like the other is necessary since it's about the same views. I'd say stay overnight or two if possible. It's such a nice getaway and so peaceful, especially in Trang An.",2025-04-01 14:25:54,1,Ok-Environment-9839,VietNam

mjwzz20,1jkgk21,reddit,"Specialist of French Indochina here and the Indochina War specifically. I’ve seen plenty of images of French outposts in archival photographs and newsreels and generally speaking you’ll see the French tricolor or the flag of the State of Vietnam (after 1949), which is the yellow flag with three horizontal lines that would be maintained by the Republic of Vietnam after 1954/1955 ([examples here](https://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/vietnam-indochina-french-magazine-1692619398)). 

The French Far-East Expeditionary Corps, to my knowledge, did not have its own flag. 

Although the image is blurry, the men in the foreground are wearing the chapeau de brousse, the typical French field hat worn by troops in the French Far-East Expeditionary Corps and their colonial auxiliaries. 

OP mentioned this image came from a newsreel. If you can, could you post a link to it so we can verify? Otherwise I share the opinions of others here that suggests part of the tricolor is simply washed out.",2025-03-26 22:39:14,3,Henri-W-Defense,VietNam

Based on the image and info, it looks like the unit has 1 bedroom and 1 toilet — probably around 60m² or even less. The balcony with all the tables and chairs? That doesn’t seem like it belongs to the unit. I’m pretty sure it’s part of a café inside the building.

So, for 10 million VND/month, what are you really getting? A 60m² apartment with one bedroom, one toilet, a sea view, and a 5-minute walk to the beach.

But if I were a tourist, with the same 10 million VND/month, I could rent a fully furnished house — around 5x20m², 3 floors, 4 bedrooms, 3 toilets, and just a 10-minute drive to the beach.

molcalw,1k5rkxp,reddit,"Cái này không có gì lạ. Nông sản và hoa quả giữa AÁEAN và TQ, nó có 2 tầng, vừa là kinh tế, vừa là chính trị.



Về mặt kinh tế, có lợi cho cả đôi bên. Thêm mặt hàng cho dn nhập khẩu Trung Quốc, kích thích tiêu dùng nội địa và các sản phẩm đi theo( vd: sầu riêng tươi, sinh tốt sầu riêng, kem sầu riêng, xôi sầu riêng....). Còn về chiều ngược lại, doanh nghiệp xuất khẩu có lợi, đặc biệt người nông dân tăng thu nhập vì có đầu ra giá cao.



Nhưng về mặt chính trị, nếu phụ thuộc đầu ra quá nhiều vào một thị trường thì nó như vòng kim cô trên đầu tôn ngộ không. Nếu chính trị không theo hướng, CP Trung Quốc có thể sử dụng nó như một biện pháp để ép nước đối phương. Có nhiều lý do, không đảm bảo an toàn vệ sinh, dư lượng chất xyz...điều này đã từng xảy ra như thịt lợn của VN năm 2015, 2018, thuỷ hải sản/rượu vang Australia, dứa/nông sản Đài Loan, nhân sâm Mỹ,...thiệt và lợi thì hầu hết, phe đối phương sẽ thiệt nặng hơn, vì phía Trung Quốc có thể nhập nguồn từ các nước khác còn nông dân các nước đó thì lãnh đủ vì bạn hàng lớn nhẩt bị mất, chi phí đầu tư lớn, nếu nông sản không bán được sẽ tốn rất nhiều tiền để bảo quản và sẽ hỏng rất nhanh, buộc họ phải bán tống bán tháo cắt lỗ. Mà ở các nước, nông dân dù ít nhiều đều là một phần dân số khá ảng hưởng đến chính trị trong nước nên sẽ ép các chính trị gia phải hành động.




Còn về phía lào thì khỏi nói rồi. Lào gần Trung Quốc, vận chuyển gần, cũng trồng được sầu riêng. Nhiều vùng trồng mới là của dn Trung Quốc sang đầu tư, có cả kỹ thuật, nguyên liệu, máy móc và đảm bảo thị trường đầu ra ổn định. Nhưng về khía cạnh chính trị thì đây cũng là một bước: nếu Myanmar đang nội chiến, Việt nam đang cố trung lập giữa Mỹ Trung, thì Lào là mắt xích quan trọng trong chiến lược của TQ nối xuống đất liền đông nam á. HSR từ Lào qua Cambodia đến vịnh thái lan rồi Malaysia. Đây vừa là một chút lợi TQ cho Lào nhưng cũng vừa khiến Lào sâu thêm vào tầm ảnh hưởng TQ.




Còn sầu riêng Việt, theo tôi biết qua lời người quen thì ta có lợi thế ở mùa vụ. Sầu riêng malay, thái chưa vào vụ thì Việt Nam đã có để bán rồi. Tuy nhiên vẫn còn nhược điểm là, chưa có chuyên môn để phân tích thị trường, cung-cầu, dẫn đến việc thừa. Đặc biệt hơn là nhiều vùng chưa có một tiêu chuẩn chung cho các nhà vườn, dẫn đến một số hàng bị tồn dư hoá chất bị phía TQ trả lại.

Ninh Kieu is the district in that city

Hung Loi is the district ward. You are lucky yours is named. Mine is just Phuong and a number.

There are no Streets named 20/4 but there is one called 30/4 so I assume you wrote that one down wrong. You also forgot the D. for Duong which means Street. The streets are usually names of historic heroes sometimes something different and in this case it is Reunification Day/Liberation Day. That's what all the parade training is for.

(Here would now come alley if there is one, short H or Hem. If you look to the north you could see some places that are in a lot in an alley, think of it as a side street to a main street)

F is your lot, like a block of housings. I can't find a F but there is a 28- If you tried to scramble your address you really should tell us so we can actually help you. It's not an alley but a block. If you look up and down that block you will see they will most likely all be Number + F. Exception for those homes that existed there before they assigned a lot. Usually this happens because that place long ago used to be a field or small settlement and the city grew around it. The farmer then sells off their farm and only keeps one place with the original address.

And at last the house number (followed by the apartment complex name and apartment number if you were in a multi-rise).

My address looks like something like this: S112 T10, \[name of a mall\], H129, 123C, street name \[historic figure\], P5, Q5, HCM.

Which means Apartment Number (So) 112, Floor (Tang) 10, \[mall name\] because same as apartment complex name, alley (Hem) 129, house number 123 in Block C of street \[historic figure\], Ward (Phuong) 5, District (Quan) 5, Ho Chi Minh City.

You shorten it to 112/10 \[mall name\] \]129/123C, \[Historic figure\] P5/Q5 HCM.

I highly recommend you write ""D."" in front of the 30/4 so people know its 30th of April as a street name.

mofg4ck,1k54m92,reddit,"The front side of the house with access to the street is the most valuable aspect of the land.

A plot of land with access to the street is often multiple times more valuable than a plot of land that can only access an alley. It is also the ""storefront"", so for business purpose, the wider the storefront, the better business prospect of the plot of land, this much is obvious. So there were period where taxation is base on how wide the front is, instead of the total area.

Of course, everyone want a plot of land with wide and big front, obviously, but they are gonna be more expensive, so if you cant afford a plot with big front, then you at least want a plot of land with ""some"" front.

So the reason lots of land in Vietnam is ""tube shape"" is because people prefer land with some front, or access to the main street.

So when dividing land, you often divide it down the fronts,, thus the tube shape.

In Short:

People here place huge importance on the front side of the house, or ""mặt tiền"". Everyone want a piece of ""mặt tiền"", so overtime, the front got narrow, to get as many plots as possible to have a street facing front, or ""mặt tiền"".",2025-04-22 13:37:45,6,Sedaku,VietNam

Couple what with the weather and pollution and the potential for you to get sick, I would not be planning this intense of an itinerary. 

Both Ninh Binh and Ha Long took 3 hours each way back to Hanoi with the traffic. Haven't been to Sapa but I imagine that's longer. So that's already 12+hrs just sitting in a car plus Sapa.

You don't need a whole day in Hoi An. You can have clothes tailored anywhere in Vietnam and there are plenty of tailors in HCM. Youre putting a lot of faith in someone making a perfect garment without any need for adjustments within a day in Hoi An. Just ask your family in HCM when you're there. Hoi an also only comes alive in the evening/night. During the day it is incredibly hot and dead quiet.

you don't need to stay a night up in Ba Na. You'll see it all within a day and there's nothing on there at night. Go stay in a resort in Da Nang.",2025-04-18 23:12:34,3,pichuru,VietNam

I'd love to see a lot of the other cities and towns and areas, but in my travels I've learned that I'm consistently happier getting to know a place better over several days, and giving myself lots of cushion time for things going wrong (and things do go wrong quite a bit with travel within Vietnam - it almost seems more common to have delays and cancelations and other hiccups than it is for travel to go according to plan), and several days between travel days.

Travel itself wears me out, so even taking an overnight train from Nha Trang to Hoi An, I could barely convince myself to venture out into Hoi An the day I arrived because I was exhausted from the train - and I actually slept pretty well on it!

Let's take Soviet as example : They helped Germany for their own military and economic benefit, to improve their nation standing against both the capitalist Allies and the Fascist Axis. They can instantly switch side if they see Allies deal are better for them, and vice versa.   
  
Same with Poland, they themselves grab Czechoslovakia land when the partition happened (not very nice ), but the 1934 pact part is misleading : Poland signed that as non-aggression pact, not alliance pact ! They are not the same, for example Molotov - Ribbentrop pact does not mean somehow Soviet join the Axis, it's just mean that Soviet and Germany will not touch other sphere of influence ( for the time being :) )

In conclusion, because history is rarely viewed as black and white, try to claim that Soviet action is worse than Poland or vice versa is meaningless, because we study history to understand the underlying motive of past action more than to give a definitive good vs evil.",2025-04-17 19:26:09,12,Responsible_Board950,VietNam

Do drink beer at a bia hoi while eating mam tom and chao and strike up a conversation with a drunkle

Safety/comfort tips:
- If you're gonna bring a decent amount of cash, get a flat bag that you can hide beneath your shirt or whatever so nobody knows you've got money
- Wear fake jewelry only or wear as little jewelry/valuable things as possible because petty theft is common enough
- Travel with a buddy if you can! It's more fun and safer (that goes for anywhere you travel tho lol)
- Bug/mosquito repellent is a must because mosquitos are everywhere...
- Fair warning that Saigon does not smell the best sometimes because the hygiene system in Vietnam is not good—very pretty and fun place tho
- Be wary of the plain water served at restaurants... just drink bottled water for your safety
- Also... bring Pepto Bismol... because again... hygiene over there is 😩

Foods/places:
- Maybe I'm biased as a Vietnamese person, but lowkey 98% of places over there have good food
- ABSOLUTELY visit Bánh Mì Như Lan in Saigon because I've gone there since I was little and the food and desserts are top notch
- Visit the lotus fountain in Saigon at night because it's gorgeous
- There are plenty of high-end stores near that lotus fountain, if you're into that",2025-04-14 19:30:56,3,Tsunami_Aureate,VietNam

mn52vdw,1jz78e1,reddit,"* Dont use taxis. Use Grab or Xanh. Don't just hop on to any guy with a green jacket claiming to be your driver or a driver. ALWAYS USE THE APP to book and confirm.
* Don't get an e-sim, buy one either from the airport or downtown. Make sure it's one with an actual number, data and text. You will need all that if you are going to install something like Zalo, which is used by everyone in Vietnam. Also sometimes your cab driver will call you and you will need a phone number for that.
* Don't do group tours or any tours, unless absolutely necessary. If it's just you, I would strongly recommend to do the Saigon Kiss Tour (its a tour by scooter) and whatever version of that they have in Hanoi.
* Don't waste time travelling from place to place, ignore anyone telling you do rushed tours, like to go from Hanoi to TamCoc in one day and back or from Hanoi to HaLong Bay in one day, etc.
* TPBank ATMS dont charge extra fees for withdraw.
* Google Translate is a must have app.
* Almost anywhere you use credit cards, there will be a 3-6% extra fee. Don't fight it, accept it as a convenience.
* Street food is almost always safe if it's from a well known place, not some random portable vendor from a night market.
* Beware or AirB&B ""experiences"", most of them are scams set up by foreigners exploiting locals.
* Listen to your hotel or homestay staff, they can book stuff for you and can vouch for it, since if it doesn't work as intended, they are the ones stuck with the bad review.

mmutj72,1jy06u6,reddit,">1) My family plans to get a tour guide, but I don’t think its necessary, what do you all suggest ? 

Vietnam is fairly accessible to DIY given you put some planning into days around the city.

A tour can be booked for day-trips outside the city such as a Mekon Delta or Cu Chi trip. Either private for just your family or a join-in group of varying sizes with other people.

>2) We plan on getting custom made clothes, I know Vietnam is famous for tailoring clothes. Can you guys suggest places to get clothes tailored for a good & affordable price?

Been happy with Chương Tailor and Sir Tailor

>What is the price range for dresses/tops or suits ?

Can vary depending on the fabric you choose.


>3) What places do you suggest we visit ? 

5 days is pretty limited as to what you can see *around* Vietnam.

**Day 1**

Arrival day, depending on when you arrive it could vastly impact your first day. Morning arrivals will allow you to start exploring after dropping off your bags.

**Day 2**

Food trip/cafe hopping/(souvenir) shopping/tailors. If you decide on having something made, visiting a tailor on the first day is advisable so adjustments could be made later into the trip.

**Day 3**

A day tour to Cu Chi tunnels or the Mekon Delta. Both are (half) day tours and could be done on day 3 and day 4 if you decide on doing them both.

**Day 4**

Cultural/Historical/Touristic spots.

Search up any of the walking tours online and note down the points of interest and do it yourself. Do some extra research of popular spots you'd like to visit.

**Day 5**

Self-care day, spa, hair salons, nail techs etc. before your flight home.

For another day or 2D1N trip you could head down to Vung Tau, a beach town not far from Vung Tau. Either stay centrally or go a bit further to relax at a resort.

Question for you if you've ever been to Melaka. What's your personal recommendation where to eat? Coincidentally going to Malaysia tomorrow.

mmv6rfk,1jy06u6,reddit,"Malaysian here, went to HCM 2 years ago.

Honestly if you're savvy you don't need a tour guide. 
HCM is actually not that big.

Around District 1 it seems like most locals can somewhat understand English since there are a lot of tourists there.

The outer parts of the city is sort of like travelling from KL to PJ. That's where it might be troublesome cos the locals there don't really understand English. So it'll be a lot of finger pointing and Google translate.

You can get around with the Grab app.

I recommend you try hunting for their Sau Rieng Ri 6 durian if you're into that. They're massive.

If you can, go to any rooftop bar at night for a great view of Saigon river. It's quite spectacular imo.

You will need a travel guide if you plan to do any of the packages outside the city like Cu Chi Tunnels as somebody pointed out.

Just travel around the city and enjoy the views.

Oh and be careful at Tan son nhat airport. As soon as you step out plenty of car service people will try to scam you for basically just a 7km ride. Just ignore them and call a Grab.",2025-04-13 08:22:59,1,royalblue9999,VietNam

October is just right.


Go in the middle of the year, it's hot, humid and rainy. There's not much in the way of street life, because everyone's too hot and bothered, and nobody wants to get rained on. 


I've never been around December-January, but I gather it gets cold and rainy then. I don't want that, but some might who nose.


Last year I was there in April. It was a little on the hot side, and it did rain just a little bit, but overall it was still pretty good. Maybe I should have gone in March instead? But that couldn't have been arranged.


The time I went before though, was October 23, and it was great. I recommend Hanoi at that time of year. Not too hot, not too cold, the whole city smelt of food because of all the pop-up cafes on the street, there were lots of cultural activities on the street (traditional pantomimes, interesting buskers in traditional dress, that sort of thing) and it all felt very cool and frenetic.

You will not “win” any conversations with elders if you are younger, and if you’re a lot younger, then it’s considered extremely disrespectful.

You can bring your prescription, but they will also check your vision to ensure everything is perfect.

For dental care, **Pucasso Dental Clinic** in Danang is a great choice. I went there once for a teeth cleaning, and they did a fantastic job at a very affordable price.

* If the property is under my name (I'm a foreigner), I understand there are restrictions.
* If it's under her name, what are the risks if the relationship ever breaks down?
* Is it possible to have joint ownership (e.g., 50/50)?
* In case of divorce, how is property typically handled in Vietnam?

* Our marriage was registered abroad and still needs to be recognized officially in Vietnam.
* We have a pre-nup from our country of marriage, though I'm not sure how enforceable it is under Vietnamese law.

I tried to leave the country, but immigration at the airport denied me boarding and said I had to go to the immigration office. I wasn’t allowed to pay the fine at the airport.

At the HCMC immigration office, they’ve told me I *must* apply for a visa extension, which could take 2 weeks or even longer. (one officer quoted up to two months!) After this happened, I went back with a Vietnamese friend who clearly asked whether I could apply for an *exit visa*, but the officer said this doesn’t exist and that an extension is the only way forward.

From everything I’ve read online, applying for an exit visa (or exit permit) seems like the standard route for overstays under 30 days. I don’t want to stay in Vietnam longer, I just want to leave as soon as possible and pay the fine.

I’ve already filled out the NA5 and supporting documents, but haven’t submitted them yet.

Has anyone been through this recently and can confirm:

* Does the exit visa actually exist and apply in this situation?
* Can I still request it even if the officer says no?
* Is this just a bureaucratic block or is extension genuinely the only way?

mnrfayt,1joi5kt,reddit,"I recently went to California Fitness for what they advertised as a free 30-day trial.

But when I arrived, I didn’t get to try anything. Instead, I was sat down and sold to for the entire session by a staff member. They told me to come back the next day for a “free personal training” session to try things out properly.

On the second day, I went for what I thought was just a trial PT session. The trainer reassured me there would be no sales. But after the session, a staff member sat me down and tried to sell me a 24-month membership installment plan. I refused, clearly said I wasn’t ready — then they brought out another staff member to pressure me again.

After intense pressure, I caved and gave a 6 million VND deposit, thinking I’d just go home and cancel if I felt unsure.

But when I tried to cancel (the same evening), they said I needed to do it in person. When I returned, they told me no refunds, and offered to convert the deposit into 8 PT sessions instead. They also claimed they had already opened a loan for me with Sacombank before 7PM — even though I hadn’t signed anything for that.

Eventually, after more pushing, they said they’d refund my money — but it would take 90 days.

I’ve received zero services, signed nothing with the bank, and now my money is being held hostage for 3 months. I feel tricked.

Is this legal in Vietnam? Has anyone experienced something similar? What can I do to get my money back sooner?",2025-04-18 14:09:36,1,Tab_brickyPh,VietNam

I’m planning a trip to Vietnam this fall and like most tourists, I’m concerned about the weather.

I’m not afraid of rain—I take that is a given in Vietnam. But I’d like to avoid storms and floods that could drastically affect travel plans and sight-seeing opportunities.

I’m considering going for three weeks and spending roughly one week in each of the three regions, South, Central and North (I’ll figure out precisely how much time at each location after I settle on a travel date).

My first plan was leaving very late September/early October—but I’m concerned about the weather being too volatile in the Central region.

Is early November in the South and Central regions, and then mid-November in the North, a better plan than the same trip in October; and is November generally good for visiting the whole of Vietnam?

mo9eibq,1joi5kt,reddit,"Hi,

I'm looking for some help with a 15 night itinerary, starting and ending in Hanoi, in May. I'm going with my wife for our honeymoon, so we're looking at things more on the luxury side of things as opposed to backpacker/solo travel which a lot of advice seems geared to.

In terms of things we enjoy, she enjoys the city and hussle and bustle, whereas I prefer to see more of the nature side of things - however neither of us is particularly adventurous! So doing something like the Ha Giang loop, which many people recommend, seems a bit of a stretch - neither of us ride motorbikes and some of the safety concerns seem a bit worrying to me! However we do want to avoid things which are super super touristy e.g manufactured purely for tourists and to sell you stuff

Places we've got on a short list to see so far are:

- Hanoi - 3 nights
- Lan Ha Bay cruise (maybe) - 2 nights
- Sapa (maybe) - 2 nights
- Ninh Binh - 1 (or 2) nights
- Hoi An - (? nights)
- Hue - (? nights)
- Da Nang (fly back to Hanoi)

I'm currently unsure about Sapa or the bay cruise - have read some mixed things about both in terms of how touristy they are.

My main concern with going to all these places is just how much time we'll spend travelling. We do still want to relax and have some time to spend in nice accomodation, as opposed to being on sleeper trains the whole time - but on the other hand most of the places don't necessarily seem like they have enough to do for more than a 3 night stay?

Would be great to get some advice on how to balance moving about constantly with staying put but not getting too bored!

In my family, we of course drink both, but tea is consumed so much more. I wouldn't be surprised if it's also the case for most of the other Vietnamese households.

There's a guest coming to our house? Tea. You're pretty thirsty after that one cup of coffee? Tea. You're dining out and that nice meal of yours finally comes to an end? Also tea. It happens to be so damned it *cold* that day? (I'm a Northerner.) Tea again, for most people, including my father. My mother is admittedly more fond of coffee when it comes to this kind of thing. You're planning to hang out and chat with a friend? Again, tea as the most common choice of drinks, while coffee coming in the second place. Those tiny road-side vendors sound just like what we all need. Oh, now you're visiting a close family friend or someone relatively important? Might as well consider bringing dried tea or maybe some other things with you, as a present.

I honestly don't understand where the impression that coffee is a bigger part of our culture comes from. Maybe it's because our green tea is much more bitter and astringent than Chinese green tea? I wouldn't be surprised if the ones who're used to that kind of tea dislike ours. I'm already used to Vietnamese green tea, so to me Chinese teas tend to smell pretty nice but do not really taste like anything at all.

moub69f,1k6xe7j,reddit,"It really really depends on your abilities and interest.

I'll just give some thoughts below for you to naw on:

* To have a true Vietnam experience, you need to rent a motorbike at each destination. 
* Best food and best city: HCMC, but not very touristy. 
* Hanoi is also nice and has more tourism options. 
* The north has the best nature. (Central probably too but it's less documented)

* If you like cities, bars, food, HCMC is a must. Many people are disappointed here because touristy options here kinda suck. 
* Hanoi is also cool and is a better jumping off point to many destinations. 
* The Ha Giang loop was my favorite experience in Vietnam but you need to be at least intermediate on a motorbike and really best if you have a friend to help you. 
* Da Lat is also super cool. It's touristy but very few foreigners. Cool vibe. 
*Ninh Binh is cool too. 
* My wife loved ha Giang but hated sapa. Way too touristy for her. 

So, yeah. Do you want hard mode or easy mode? Can you ride a motor bike? Do you prefer (a) easy touristy (b) adventure (c)cities

Cops are getting less lenient on motorbike licenses so also look into that as well. I'm not up to date on it in regards to the whole country. 

Lastly, weather. Weather in Vietnam is diverse and honestly not well documented on travel sites. You could have a bad time if you're not prepared. 

The best time to come southern Vietnam is fall/winter. December is ideal. April is the worst time by far. It gets so fucking humid that it's essentially unlivable even for locals. As you get into may you'll finally start getting those torrential rains but they make the air much more comfortable. 

In the north there are times when the pollution is awful. I don't fully understand, but it has to do with grass burning and some sort of weather phenomenon trapping the pollution around the city. 

Each area of the country will have their own optimal season, monsoon season, et al. You'll want to do careful research not trusting your first answer. 

Too many tourist guides just look at rainfall and temperatures, and can give you really really bad suggestions.

If you want to visit least popular ones, go to Cao Bang (you can combine it with Ha Giang Loop), Mai Chau and Pu Luong for beautiful rice terraces depending on the season. Sa Pa is super popular but stay in villages instead of the SaPa town.  
  
Stay overnight in Ninh Binh, do Trang A boat ride and visit Hoa Lu old town and Walking street in the evening until late night. There are many other things to do in Ninh Binh besides Hang Mia caves and boat ride. Dia Tang Phi Lai Pagoda and Van Long Wetland Nature Reserve for instance. Just cycle through the paddy fields early in the morning or during sunset it's very serene. 

If you want to visit THE caves, Phong Nha is the place. Paradise Cave (spectacular), Phong Nha Cave and duck stop can be done in a day. There are buses running to and fro from Hanoi/ Ninh Binh. 

So I would suggest - Ha Giang and or Cao Bang together, Sa Pa or Mai Chau & Pu Luong together and Ninh Binh. Base yourself in Hanoi. All these places have great connectivity via road - VIP cabin bus and limo options.",2025-04-25 09:06:20,2,beingwabisabi,VietNam

mowuzgf,1k6ukrv,reddit,"Some are,  When you buy tickets online on CGV it will say whether the movie has English subs or not.  Sometimes Hollywood movies will have Vietnamese dubs instead of subs.  So look out for that as well.


For other movie chains (I think Galaxy is the only other major player) it should specify on their website whether a movie at a specific theater has English subs or not.


Btw CGV has some nice specialty movie theaters.  You should try the Ultra 4DX theater.  There's only one Ultra 4DX theater in Vietnam iirc.  The other 4DX theaters in Vietnam are of the regular variety not Ultra.  I went to both and there's a difference.  The Ultra 4DX theater has vents on the back of the seats around your neck area.  And if there's a scene where there's a lot of fire then it'll blow hot air towards your neck.  


Or if there's a scene where there's a lot of gunfire than the air vents will hit your neck with a sharp burst of air and I think your speakers in the seats also that give a ping sound.  But this airburst to the back your neck only happens in the Ultra 4DX theater not in regular 4DX theaters.  The seats in the regular 4DX theaters don't even have vents on the back of the seats.


The Ultra theaters also have smoke machines.  The smoke machines are pretty small though.",2025-04-25 03:42:19,2,xmod3563,VietNam

Phu Quoc is about the only place that qualifies for this. I also agree with what you heard, but it is a nice chill island to relax on.

Ha Giang and Sapa are beautiful, but lots of travelling there and lots of motorbiking when you are there.

HCMC is a great city, and I'd recommend it over Hanoi, but I wouldn't want to stay more than 2 nights if I'm on vacation.

Look at Da Nang, it has an airport, it is a city that is cleaner than either of the 2 major cities, and it is next to Hoi An which is probably the best tourist place in the country. 

Ha Long Bay is another major destination, and while the scenery is amazing, everything else isn't (busy, in an industrial area, pollution, expensive, the need to avoid scams).

If I was recommending to my friends, I'd tell them to stay a week in Da Nang, with half a week in HCMC and the other half in Phu Quoc.",2025-04-24 08:35:03,2,bigbadbass,VietNam

If you don’t want to walk barefoot on the floor, it might be a good idea to wear socks. You don’t need to bring a gift, but if you want to, gifting fruits is a great choice when visiting someone. Mangoes, mandarins, papayas, cherries and dragon fruits are all good options. However, it’s best to avoid gifting bananas or pears, as they may be considered bad luck by some. If your kid is not comfortable using chopsticks, it’s ok to ask for a fork or spoon. The family will be very happy if you ask for a second (compliment to the chef!) Keep in mind that most Vietnamese people will continue to put food on your plate until you can no longer eat. In such cases, it’s perfectly acceptable to say you’re full. Vietnamese children are typically taught to respect elders, so it’s a good idea to greet everyone, especially the elderly, with a nod or a wave when entering the house. Express gratitude whenever possible, and say goodbye when you leave. Most importantly, don’t overthink and have fun!

Delays are also not always the departure airport's issue but can be various other reasons such as airplane, weather, arrival airport.

Day 1: Fly to Hanoi, visit museums and mausoleum (eat bun cha, pho, banh mi, drink mango smoothies)

Day 2: tour to ninh binh, water puppet in hanoi at evening

Day 3: tour to halong bay, in evening walk around old quarter, go to the train spot to see train pass close to you. Nice video and pics

Day 4: Fly to danang in the morning, visit temples, then take taxi to HOI AN in the afternoon to visit the old town and take a little boat cruise. After dinner and everything closes, take taxi back to danang

Day 5: daytour to hue with imperial city and tombs and pagoda, chill at beach in danang in evening. Buy seafood dinner in danang

Day 6: Fly to ho chi minh city from danang. Walk around, visit museums and palace. In afternoon around 5pm go to landmark 81 tower (or bitexco tower) to go to the top and enjoy the view of the city with sunset. Then in evening can do a cruise + dinner or take a night hop-on, hop-off tourbus around the city (visits all landmarks, but cant hop off). End the evening at Buy vien party street. 

Day 7: if your flight is late in evening, then do a daytour to mekong delta, if not, then enjoy ho chi minh city and fly home.

Tips: 
- install grab and only get taxi through this. Cheapest and trusted

- get a physical sim at the airport so you dont have to worry about internet. It's more expensive than in the city, but its still cheap (13usd instead of 8 usd), try to get the viettal 5g (vodaphone fine too), the one inside the airport near the exit is where I bought mine

- use vietjetair for planes within vietnam, use 12go asia for busses if you prefer overnight bus.

- for daytours use getyourguide or klook, its usually very cheap (except halong bay) so its nice if you give a tip afterwards. 100-200k but not required. Depends on you and how good the guide was

- get cash from atms, don't use exchanges. There's tons everywhere. If atm asks to do conversion, press no. If you can find an atm from shinhan its good because doesn't ask any transaction fee. Other banks 1 to 5 dollar 

- People will ask you to buy things even if you're just sitting at a café and enjoying a drink. Don't be rude or get annoyed, they don't earn much and they already deal with rejection all day everyday. Prices are cheap too, so if you see something you need you can buy

- small shops will count on you to haggle, but don't be a douche for a few cents.. a dollar to you is a lot less than to them. 

- have fun, be nice, don't get annoyed, be aware of culture shock, careful when crossing the road, male solo travelers will get asked by prostitutes.. Just say no thanks and move along. Drugs and prostitution are illegal on paper.

I loved Hà Nội. It’s the marmite capital if Vietnam if you go by Reddit alone, totally polarising views. I loved the coffee culture and the chaos and the food and connecting with local folk. 

Hoi An I liked but it was very busy and lantern boats not my jam. Some good tailors but a lot of poor quality ones now. You need to go there with trusted recommendations. An Bang beach I thought was fine and you can get a sun lounger for much much cheaper than you would in Nha Trang! 

Ninh Binh, Sapa and Ha Giang- out of these three that I visited, Ha Giang loop was my favourite. The views you can get (on a clear day) are nothing short of spectacular. Ninh Binh was nice to chill after the loop. Sapa trek- only do this if the weather is good/has been good the previous few days because the treks can be treacherous in the mud. Multiple injuries in our group! But I think at least two days trek is good.

All the locations you have mentioned are great, and not too far from each other, I would add Hue if possible, it has lots to see and do: the old citadel, the dragon theme abadoned park, etc. Da Nang has Marble Mountain with big caves and a great view, beautiful beaches and a big Buddha with monkeys around it, etc.

This is the best vegan food I ever had to be honest. 

Then you have vegetarian tourist restaurants that will probably cater more to your taste with tofu and vegetables. More expensive but some of them are really amazing and often it's the only option.
