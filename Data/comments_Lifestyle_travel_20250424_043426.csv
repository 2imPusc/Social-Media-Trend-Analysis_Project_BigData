My best story is I booked my sad-girl trip to Paris one year and on the first morning there I got picked up by a hot Sorbonne professor in a used bookshop in the 10th Arrondissement and he ended up giving me a tour of that part of the city. Except he spoke only French and Spanish, while I had at the time just English and German and a smattering of French, so I spent the day wracking my brain to understand him. 

He wanted to meet up again the next day but I wanted the trip not to be about a guy so I didn’t call him.",677,2025-04-04 09:50:19,ZweitenMal

travel,1jr7zgf,mlegl6z,"What seems like a lifetime ago, I lived down in Central TX (Killeen for the ones who would know 🙄) and had a similar situation. I had just moved in, and was at the mailboxes (the development was broken up into quadrants and each one had its own area with a big “bank” of mailboxes) and got to chatting with one of the neighbors. She informs me that her family is having a cookout, and that I should swing by. 

Normally I’m an incredibly reserved person and would never lol but I had moved from Maryland to Texas to live with my best friend at the time while he was in the Army who then went back home for a visit a week after discharge and just kinda never returned, so I just moved out (since technically I was never actually on the lease 😂). Due to this and my reluctance to return home with my tail tucked, and also I was getting the vibe that she was into me so I said fuck it and decided to go. 

I waited about an hour after the time she told me that it started and headed out the door and started walking. I then realized that I never got the address (I was incredibly shy and had low self esteem back then, I was not great at communicating effectively with women especially if they showed even an ounce of interest lmao), just the general street that I saw her walk back down so I just started walking in that direction. About halfway down that street I heard the loudest party sounds I’d ever heard and figured that was the place so I walked into the backyard and started scanning around for the woman that had invited me.

After a few minutes, I realized that not only do I not see her, but I’m the only white person in this yard. Literally everyone else is very obviously of some sort of Spanish-speaking lineage. I start asking for Maria in what little Spanish I remember from high school and I’m met with about 100 confused looks when they hear my awful Spanish, followed by them pointing at one of about 25 different women at that party named Maria. At one point a man with a comically large cowboy hat and belt buckle shoved a 24oz Modelo in my hand when asked where Maria was, so once again I said fuck it I’m already here so I sat down to enjoy my beer and just take it all in. 

A few moments later, an elderly woman sits down with me and in English as broken as my Spanish asks who I am, who I’m looking for, etc. so I tell her my story. She starts laughing hysterically and calls over at least a dozen other Abuelitas and tells them my story, to which they all respond similarly. She comes back after they all chat a bit, and tells me that the family I’m looking for lives on the next street over. Apparently I saw her walk down this street bc she was on her way to this literal house to wish a happy 15th birthday to the girl that lived here.

Now I’m the first to admit that I was extremely naive to  a lot of traditions of other cultures (still am, but I’ve been actively trying to learn and expand what I know of cultures other than my own) but I knew how big of a deal that was and I was immediately mortified. I just barged into some girls fucking QUINCEÑERA, and I’m just sitting there like I belong with a beer in my hand and I’m sure the most curious mix of utter embarrassment and shame on my face. 

The Abuelitas all assured me it was fine I was there and insisted that I eat some of the food and have more beer and tequila. The food was some of the best I’ve ever had, and to this day I’ve never seen that brand of tequila on a store shelf here in the states but it converted me into a tequila fan for life. I ended up having a great time, made some great friends in the area for the rest of the time I was living there, and the father actually walked with me over to the party I was originally supposed to attend and introduced me as the gringo that crashed his daughters Quinceñera to many appalled faces until he very rapidly in Spanish explained what happened. I do have to say, I admire how quickly and efficiently they seem to be able to say everything that needs to be said 😂. Stayed at the second party til the sun came up the next day and made even more friends.

travel,1jrf8zn,mlez959,"I am a small white man (wearing a beard if that matters) and fully resonate with the staring, being grabbed, asked questions, ""offered"" unsolicited rides, etc...It can indeed become a bit exhausting. It happened even when I would not have expected tourists to draw attention. 

Funny thing, though, is when I inadvertently found myself staring at a rickshaw driver to confirm it was the one who had tried to rip me off the night before (i.e. asking 30 USD for a 1-minute ride). I was staring so intensely that he asked me what I was looking at. He then proceeded to offer me another unsolicited ride at the same price.",778,2025-04-04 18:22:46,flycity2

travel,1jrf8zn,mlh03nj,"Black man (51) that visited a little over a month ago with a yoga group. At first my guard was up. Hyper aware of looks and energy. After my second week there I let it go. Just did not care. When people asked for photos I obliged and then asked for theirs. I had some genuine interactions once I let my guard down and embraced my alien presence. For the most part, I was shown lots of love by the Indian people and the looks were understandable curiosity. 

One thing that really did get to me was the way crowds can become aggressive and dangerous in an instant. Literally inside temples and people shoving with total disregard. It was insane. Stampedes with multiple casualties are a fairly common occurrence. Just recently at a pilgrimage site and about a month ago a deadly stampede at a train station in Delhi.

travel,1jmswgf,mke87ug,"Years ago I read a book called *A Carpet Ride to Khiva*, and this inspired a bit of an obsession with Uzbekistan. Ever since, I’ve been wishing I could go, learning more about the country, daydreaming about tasting dried melon and reading more books. Finally, the chance arose last September and off I went.

Visited: Tashkent, Fergana valley, Khiva, drove through the desert to Bukhara, Samarkand, Shahrisabz.

I got quite a few stares from men as a young woman in Fergana (the more conservative area of the country) but beyond that everyone was extremely friendly and polite almost to a fault. The country was a lot more developed for tourism than I’d expected, some areas even pretty touristy. Tashkent felt quite Soviet with the wide roads and USSR-style statues. 

My favourite places were Khiva (it’s drop-dead gorgeous, not much else needs to be said), Shah-i-Zinda and, predictably, Afrasiyab (it was the place I was most excited to see) and the Observatory of Ulugbek, but one needs a bit of historical context to appreciate those last two (English signs are lacking even in the museums). Plus the train ride from Tashkent to Fergana and drive down to Shahrisabz. That drive had some autumn leaves but also reminded me strangely of driving through Spain with family when I was younger.

While most of the more impressive monuments are in Samarkand and Bukhara, and Khiva was very photogenic, I have to say that Fergana is where I felt I got to know what the country was like outside of the more touristy areas. From the train one could see stork nests on the tips of electric poles, houses more like shacks but with intricate wooden doors, teenagers all in black and white uniforms on their way to school, a billboard advertising air-conditioners in the middle of the desert, donkey-pulled carts, street dogs and cows with birds on their backs next to the tracks (all over the country, cows are left to their own devices but have a rope around their neck tied to a stake in the ground, so they have only a little circular piece of freedom). In Kokand I found myna birds, a wedding, trees painted white, smiles of golden teeth, a car wash using extremely pink soap, squat toilets, wasps with yellow bums, three boys on a motorbike—clearly not old enough to have a license—and bus-vans. One van so covered in dust that they’d simply written the line number on the back window by hand. 

That was the Uzbekistan I wanted to see and get to know, and felt it was harder to experience in the other areas I went to. However, a lot of that could be found by going outside the Khiva walls and walking around town—the area where people actually live—if Fergana feels far away. On the way to Bukhara I asked the driver to stop at some cotton fields when a good spot came up, so we got to see some from close up too, next to a cow with her stake.

Overall, it was a very interesting country. I think I spent so much time going wow-wow-wow that I couldn’t take it all in. There were so many details to look at and enjoy that it simply became overwhelming after a while. As such, I must say I would like to revisit some day…",227,2025-03-29 18:33:16,NotACaterpillar

We just got back from Bhutan yesterday. We left from Paro airport ( currently the only international airport) 


11 night is total were spent across the following areas. 


Thimphu to Punakha to Phobjikha valley to Paro.


The whole experience was a great mixture of culture, relaxation and nature with lots of hikes. Both of us are not into hiking back home, so we both went hiking every weekend for 3 months before our trip. Definitely a must as some of these walks are above 3000m and we could the difference. 


All the people were lovely warm and trustworthy. They always asked if this was our first time and how we heard about Bhutan. It was a fair question, as most of the people at work had heard of it but didn't know where it was. 


They also said to spread the word. So here I am HIGHLY RECOMMEND GOING TO BHUTAN. 


It's expensive but it's one of those bucket list places that should be ticked off if you can afford it. 


The only thing I would change if we went again would be the timing. There were quiet a few forrest fires around due to it being so dry. This made visibility limiting at times. You can probably see it in the photos.  A better time to go would be in August or September I think.

travel,1jvavr4,mm90oq3,"Short answer: people visit Denver when they really want a place like Boulder, Estes Park, Manitou, or Golden. 

Long answer: Like others have said, covid really decimated downtown Denver. It has struggled to come back, and a lot of businesses are struggling due to numerous issues. Turnover is very high. Lodo is essentially the bar district of the downtown area and is where I would send 24 year olds. 

Denver is heavily neighborhood based, meaning each neighborhood has a somewhat unique identity. Cherry Creek is bougie/Dallas-esque, Rino is the arts/brewery district, South Broadway is dive bars, Federal/Aurora have the diverse food scenes, etc. But most of the neighborhoods are where people actively live and work and aren’t really designed to support a ton of tourists. 

So to that extent, I think one should plan out a trip to Denver based on travel guides and recommendations that align with your interests. Denver is a relatively new city and doesn’t have the amenities to support a central tourist district in a way a bigger city does. Also not to beat a dead horse but most people use Denver as the base camp for seeing other parts of the state.

travel,1jydhwm,mmxnqs1,"I don't know if I agree with the general argument. If one can't afford high-budget items, it's true they can simply avoid travelling to some places to avoid the risk of discomfort. But it would be much better if the person in question stopped being so fussy, became more open-minded and adapted to how people live in other countries. It won't hurt to let go of one's first-world comforts for a week or two. It's about one's tolerance for ""discomfort"", not about how much money one has and what we can buy.

That is, I haven't been to the USA, but I take night buses in the EU, I don't like paying more than 25€/night and I fly budget airlines. I have a fantastic experience travelling. I don't love Ryanair, but these things are hardly what I'd call a sacrifice.

> If you go to reputable hotels/restaurants, avoid public transport, and have a highly rated guide or private travel, you will avoid most of the problems in developing countries.

You're right that it will be a very comfortable experience.

I'm a tour leader. This means I accompany tour groups of European retirees to different countries and make sure everything runs smoothly. Let me say, the groups I accompany always stay at 4* hotels. They are very comfortable beds and I love that I stay there for free, but they're completely Western and uninteresting compared to other ""less comfortable"" options. We travel by private bus, which is very convenient. But most of my best travel experiences have been on public transport, it's a key part of getting to know a country. Even though we see many interesting things on each trip, I can't say I've gotten to know any of the countries I've been to as a leader beyond a general surface level.

Even if someone has the most private tour available, so long as they don't have their own luxe porta-potty, then they're going to have to engage with the ""real country"" and use a normal local squat toilet at some point.

However, apartments and houses are designed for this weather, and because the houses aren't insulated for the cold, they are designed instead to shed heat much better. Much of the reason we need AC in North America is because the houses are really designed to keep heat in. In South America, the houses are built with huge windows that open up and you're basically living outside. In Brasil, I saw many homes where half of the living space is like a giant patio outside in the middle of the home. You have the front of the house, then a huge courtyard surrounded by a concrete wall with your dining room table, kitchen, washer/dryers, etc outside, and then another building in the back just for bedrooms. Basically half the house is missing a roof.

However busses, cars, hotels, offices, public transit, gyms and malls all have AC. Basically any commercial space, to attract customers.

But in people's houses, rarely is there AC other than to sleep. Just wear next to nothing and take lots of showers.",1121,2025-03-31 14:47:27,beartheminus

In much of Europe, the weather is milder, electricity is more expensive, and there’s generally more of a mindset focused on avoiding overconsumption.

travel,1jl8x9m,mk7ycqi,"I’m glad you had a good time, but travel to Antarctica purely for tourist reasons is really unjustifiable. Tourism in the form of cruises and expeditions has a significant negative impact on the Antarctic ecology. 

Not counting the huge spike in carbon emissions per tourist just to get there, black carbon emitting vessels like cruises massively speed the melting of snow and ice. Tourists from all over the world greatly increase the chance of introducing invasive fungus and plant species as well as diseases, and expeditions disturb the local wildlife and can disrupt their reproductive cycles. 

Nearly every Antarctic scientist who’s spoken about this has taken a stand against tourism in the region, and while there’s a lot of discussion on how best to restrict tourism and mitigate its negative impact, the consensus is that it needs to be done. Many scientists themselves feel that even their own presence there is too much and have to carefully weigh whether or not their research is worth the environmental impact of them being there. 

I love travel as much as all of you, and being able to see Antarctica would be incredible, but I would never ever go. I cannot in good conscience contribute to the active destruction and degradation of one of the last nature reserves left on this planet, and I hope you also consider the impact of your choices before you plan a trip.",31,2025-03-28 17:43:57,perksofbeingcrafty

Mostly for health reasons. The reason you're told to travel while you're young is because when you're young your body can handle more, you have more energy and you never know what's going to happen in the future.

travel,1js9toe,mllvu4t,"I'm on my first visit. I've lived in a riad a week, and seeing this post I just realized that this city already has a place in my heart.

Coming from developed countries that are so sterile and ordered, the medina has struck me by how organic and ""human"" it all is. The streets and alleys that pump people through the city like arteries splitting and turning and branching into tiny capillaries. The souks where, when I want some dry beans, I find a man who trades them, and we chat while his friend is off finding change somewhere for my bill.

I know it's essentially the same interaction as at a grocery store, but it feels more personal--he's invested, trading on his own behalf, and the conversation we have is completely ""unscripted"". The cashier at Safeway wouldn't be able to ask curious questions about why I don't look like they'd expect an American to (I'm Native, which I've been having a lot of trouble explaining).

As a dumb monolingual I was lucky his languages included English. I had a funny but friendly interaction with a guy who sold me roasted walnuts (at a really good price). We had trouble communicating, so I ended up just giving him a bill that seemed reasonable and I thought was in line with his pantomiming. He gave me some change, but then it seemed to me like something was wrong. So I waited while he called somebody over from across the street who could translate. It turned out we were both all good (achievement unlocked: miscommunicate through sheer general anxiety level), and we both had a laugh about that. I told him his walnuts are très bien--I know where I'll go next time, if I can ever find that corner again.

I have no illusion that this place is perfect--I know that people are poor, women are treated far from equally, and the economy is awkwardly dependent on bilking tourists from wealthier lands. But as a person who feels like I have trouble connecting with others as much as I'd like, for me there's a magic to this city where if I didn't come out of my shell a bit, I wouldn't be able to eat.",16,2025-04-05 22:08:23,keziahw

travel,1jsyxbp,mlq5gsn,"Hi, so I'd like to share a quick photo report from one of the least visited countries in the world - Comoros. Small archipelago located in the strait between African mainland and Madagascar. I travelled solo in August/September 2024 and spent 11 days in the country.

The country consists of 3 inhabited islands - Grand Comore (Ngazidja), Mohéli and Anjouan. There's also Mayotte, fourth island in the archipelago, which is actually a department of France, as they voted against independence in the 1970s. Unfortunately I did not visit Mayotte during my trip, the flight tickets between Comoros and Mayotte are quite costly, the ferries are infrequent and equally costly, but mainly I did not have that much time and Mayotte did not seem interesting enough to cut my trip several days short.

Comoros' international airport is connected to the world by two major airlines - Ethiopian Airlines and Kenya Airways. I was quite surprised how full the flight was (daily A350 from Addis Ababa), but it makes sense - the islands are not big, but the population is quite large (900k) and as the islands are very mountaineous, any flat land is quite densely populated.

**Grand Comore** is the main island with the capital Moroni and the international airport. I would say it's the least interesting one, if it weren't for the Karthala volcano, which is stunning! It's 2361 m above the sea level and you can climb it and spend a night in the caldera. That was probably the best experience during the whole trip.

**Mohéli** is the smallest island popular for nature and wildlife - lemurs, Livingstone bats, humpback whales, turtles. While the problem with travelling in Comoros is the lack of infrastructure, Moheli has got a Belgian-owned lodge, which is not only a nice place to stay (seeing a \*clean\* beach after visiting the other two islands felt so relaxing, even though I am not a beach guy) but has locally contracted guides and you can easily make day trips from there. Diving and snorkelling is also possible.

**Anjouan** is the least visited one. I liked it a lot - but there's not ""much to see"". It's just really mountaineous, traffic is very slow, but you have nice views just about everywhere. The centuries old medina in Mutsamudu was also very nice.

As I mentioned, getting around the islands is a bit complicated. There are flights from Grand Comore to the other two islands, but not between Anjouan and Moheli. I opted for a local speedboat and honestly it's not really the experience I can recommend unless you are very adventurous. It's more than 2 hours on a cramped boat in the open sea. Wouldn't do again! In Grand Comore and Anjouan, I was able to get a car with a driver, in Moheli I just used the excursions from the lodge. Bear in mind that as it is everywhere in Africa, everything for tourists is quite expensive and so is the case in Comoros.

**The pros?** Very few tourists and the ones you meet are usually very-well travelled people. Had lots of nice talks with them. Lots of places feel really untouched and out of this world. Apart from hiking Karthala, the other highlight was a simple cross-island walk in Moheli (had to cross about 550 m tall mountain range). Very nice views, yet the guide had to clear the path with a machette for a large part of the trip. Also, lemurs coming to visit the lodge!

**The cons?** Apart from prices, the trash. I have visited many Asian and several African countries and am not surprised by the trash. But Comoros was a different league. Apart from plastic and paper almost everywhere... there are also carwrecks everywhere. At the beaches, in the gardens and backyards, in the random bushes, everywhere.

**Bottomline?** Interesting destination that gets very few visitors - and it's mostly because the lack of tourists infrastructure, not because the islands are not interesting. They are. I cannot imagine coming back, but I am still very glad I chose to travel there.

Any questions? Just ask.",67,2025-04-06 17:05:54,zennie4

Fun fact in the 1980s many southern African coups and rebellions were run out of Comoros by mercenaries led by Bob Denard. He led four coups in Comoros as well. His little beach house is in a gorgeous location, not far from where an Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed in the 80s. Another interesting thing about Comoros is that it recognized the South African government when others did not, in spite of Apartheid. For this reason there were non-stop flights between the two countries and South Africans would come to resorts on Grand Comore. There are still ruins of the resorts on the beaches.",10,2025-04-06 22:16:06,MrtonyEA

travel,1jk0j3j,mjuk3q4,"I had a similar issue at a Cancun hotel twenty years ago when I proposed to my girlfriend but, my experience was a little different.

Booked a seven day all inclusive stay through Expedia along with two excursions. We arrived and were told they were overbooked. We had booked a partial ocean view suite which had two rooms. We didn’t need it, that’s just what was available. 
We were young, both bartenders while attending college and planned to party at the local nightclubs.

Since we were a couple, they asked if we would give up our room for a family of six and transfer to one of their other properties that was for adults only.

My partner and I discussed it and agreed. Then we were told the other accommodation was 30 minutes south of Playa Del Carmen. When I balked at the move they offered a number of bonuses; a 4 day Jeep rental, $500 in gift shop credit, complimentary phone calls to the US, free laundry service, two half day spa treatments, an ocean view suite and a private car transport to the property, back to the airport and up to two trips to Playa.

We took their offer and had an amazing time. We were still able to experience one of the excursions in Cancun and picked two others in Playa and Tulum.

We only ended up partying in Playa one night because the property had three nightclubs. We didn’t use the Jeep rental after seeing how people drive on the 307 (and we were from Houston), we used the gift shop credit for sunscreen, bug spray, incidentals and ended up spending the last credit on 8 bottles of tequila.
We enjoyed the spa the day before we left.

A few weeks later, when reviewing my credit card statement, I had been issued a refund for the two excursions in Cancun but it was a $400, double the cost. I thought it was a mistake and called the property owner based in the US. They offered their apologies again and said they doubled the refund and offered us an additional four days complimentary stay.

I was floored. We ended up using the credit the next year and got married at the original property we booked with our families present.",7,2025-03-26 15:34:25,gunstar001

To put it into perspective, I am not wearing my kippah in Brussels or Berlin, so if you decide to wear religious clothing, then you unfortunately are theoretically putting yourself into a possible danger and make a target of yourself. Same would be if you were visibly gay, that is actually much more dangerous. I was spat on for only wearing a pink T-shirt in a Muslim neighborhood.

It’s extra fun for us because he’s a litigator and I negotiate contracts/ create negotiation strategies for a living, so it’s like insane practice with people we will never see again. We never buy anything and the line that always gets us out of there is “sorry guys, in my line of work if the deal doesn’t exist when we leave the table it’s never a good deal”

We’ve gotten free spa days, Marriott always gives us $400 (my parents own a MVC so I think we get extra), multiple free vacations, etc.

travel,1jjwmcl,mjqshqy,"Additionally, there may be EXIT Immigration and EXIT Customs. Its not just an ""On Entry"" thing. Although some countries may not have it  (like the US for Exit Immigration.)

To add to this, there is also a difference to the above and the Check In Agent, vs the airport security agent.

The Check In Agent just wants to know you meet the entry requirements and the ticket matches your name. If you have multiple passport nationalities, you can show both passports. This person may also check for onward travel proof, visa proof, etc. As the airline is fined if they screw up and you get deported for not meeting entry requirements. 

Airport security just wants to know two things. you are you. And your identification matches the ticketed name.

For dual nationality people, you need to show the same nationality passport to enter/exit a country's immigration. (And you often have to enter/exit using the passport of your nationality, when entering/exiting that nationality country. IE: US people must use US Passport.)

Suwarrow Island, Cook Islands. A stunning national park with one caretaker and literally nothing but birds, fish, and palm trees. All the coconuts you could want. Perfect snorkling and scuba diving. (Need your own gear) Incredible spot for a hammock nap. (Bring your own hammock)


Niuatoputapu, Tonga. A very small island that's quite a bit further north from the rest of the islands that make up the kingdom of Tonga. We visited about a year after they had gone through crazy destruction from a tsunami and helped rebuild a few homes and fences and whatnot. Great hiking and snorkeling/scuba diving (probably need your own gear)


Ureparapara, Vanuatu. A small village rests on the shores of a lagoon created from a collasped volcanic crater. A sort of C shaped island with steep volcanic slopes and lush vegetation. The women there are some of the only folks in the world that do a water dance. Slapping and manipulating the water to create impressive sounds and music. Really freaking cool. 


Kiritimati Island (Christmas Island, Tabuaeran Island, and Washington Island, Kiribati (a ""ti"" is pronounced as an ""s"", so Kiribati is pronounced Kir-ee-bas). Did cargo to these island that sit pretty much right on the equator. The nation of Kiribati is made up of hundreds of tiny atolls, but spread over an area roughly the size of the continental USA. Incredible people, facing their island homes slipping away into the ocean as weather gets more intense and ocean levels rise. 


The people throughout the South Pacific are hands down the most incredible folks on the planet. Living in some of the most beautiful places, while facing some incredibly unique and difficult challenges.

When’s we there in 1994 it was a small village that felt like time had forgotten - very medieval, muddy roads, cows and pigs walking through houses, outside latrines, cold, damp, cloudy

I don’t even know why we went there but it left a lasting impression. The bedding we had at the local B&B was the families clothes piled up 4 ft high - we both got the flu there or some derivative

The Vatican and the Vatican museum will probably stay closed to the public until a new pope is elected.

There will be a large influx of catholic visitors, from the Cardinals and their personal coteries to all kind of religious people, nuns, monks, priests ... 

If you already have your accommodations reserved, you'll at least have somewhere to sleep.

There will be a lot more people around, making eating more complicated. 

But it's going to be hectic, maybe a little bit more chaotic..

Look for smaller museums.

It will still be an interesting time to be in Rome even if you're not catholic; it's not something that happens often.

With a bit of luck, you might even be in Rome when the new pope is elected

Not a chance to visit anything in the Vatican, either closed, cancelled or packed with people queuing to see him laid out. And I mean all the way to the end of the street leading from Castel Sant'Angelo into Piazza San Pedro. Honestly I would expect the tour to get cancelled and consider it a treat if you get to go after all.

We then walked into Sant'Angelo expecting queues as well but it even seemed a little quieter than usual. 

Overall, the city (outside the immediate Vatican area) seemed comparatively quiet, even major touristy spots like the colosseum and museums. The many specifically religious visitors apparently weren't keen on doing tourist things at the time.

Do dress a bit conservatively for the churches in particular, but that also applies to any other time. 

Edit: by quiet I mean, major city normal, but we did feel it was possibly a little less busy than expected in the areas we visited.

There was not a chance to just ""walk into st Peter's square"", it was a line all the way back to Sant'Angelo and several hours wait. They had screens put up showing the inside of the cathedral along that street and people were praying, singing, talking as they waited.

Went skiing in the US which costed three times the amount I spent skiing in France, I didn’t think the price difference was worth it. I often weigh up the “value” I get out of trips. Another one was a family holiday on the coast renting a house near the beach. I’m in Australia and that trip costed more than our trip to Bali which was more fun. The way I approach things is how much enjoyment I get vs cost. If I’m spending big on accommodation it’s either for safety reasons or there’s some sort of historical/cultural interest. When we went to Bali we stayed at a luxury resort because the price was relatively cheap and for me it was worth the price difference compared to the other options. I’m not going to stay in a luxury hotel back in Sydney because the price wouldn’t be worth the extra cost for me. 

I’ve had holidays which were expensive, such as ningaloo reef but the value I got out of it was the uniqueness of the experience, swimming with whale sharks, hiking stunning gorges and staying on a cattle station. So yeah, there is definitely a cost analysis going into things and in your case I would be adding up how much extra enjoyment I would expect from the luxury hotel and if that was worth the expense. ",113,2025-04-13 00:49:26,Lingonberry_Born

The restaurants within the resort were overbooked, the service extremely slow, and I had allergies that they assured me could be accommodated. They were great the first night and then the head chef went home for the weekend or whatever and I basically got pasta sauce on bread. I mean I didn’t starve, but it also was not worth the price we paid. The resort was also in an area where you can’t go in the ocean due to rip tides or some such. It was single-handedly the worst vacation I have ever been on.

I have heard similar reviews from others who have been to Cabo. They said to stay in a hotel closer to downtown and just enjoy the restaurants there. The all-inclusives there just aren’t worth it as much.

For my part, we live in Southern California. I would have been happier renting a place in Carlsbad for a few nights and eating at some local restaurants. And once flights were figured in, it would have been a similar price.

Think about what makes you happy. For me, I couldn’t care about extra space and it would feel like a waste of money. Literally I couldn’t enjoy it knowing how much it costs and I will feel bad in the space because it feels pointless. It reduces my enjoyment of the experience.

You can book an incredible safari in Botswana for about $2000 more than that and have an incredible life changing experience. Whereas in Cabo you’re in a luxury hotel which can be experienced almost anywhere for significantly less than what you intend to pay in Cabo.

The government of Ecuador in particular does an excellent job of limiting the impact of tourism. It’s incredible that you can get so close to wildlife and that there’s absolutely no fear/flight instinct. And despite being able to get so close, there’s no danger to the ecosystem. 

Tour groups are limited to 15 people, always accompanied by a naturalist that works for the government who makes sure you follow the rules. In addition, overall ship size is limited—you’re never gonna see a mega cruise ship there. Right now I believe the limit is 100 pax. And your frequency is limited.

There’s much more for you to see that I think you’d love, especially as you’re the sort of person/couple that didn’t stay in Poblado so you probably, like me, would be more genuinely interested in the people and country. And you spend Spanish.

travel,1jjsxtj,mjqwppt,"This was a great write-up .. detailed and balanced and should be useful for people planning a trip there.   
  
Unfortunately Cartagena is the most touristy city in Colombia, and not the nice quiet eco-type tourists either.  And scams are routine there. If you ever read a story about a tourist being scammed in Colombia, chances are it's in Cartagena.  The country has sadly become a magnet for ""passport bro"" sex tourists in recent years, and the locals hate them which is why no-one seems to mind when tourists are ripped off. They assume it's these types. In Medellin where I live there's been a backlash against tourists and against digital nomads for this reason, (they also push rents up and make living in the city unaffordable for many).  
  
If you ever do make it back to Colombia I suggest going to some of the more out of the way places. Visit the Amazon for example, or the beautiful Andean cities like Popayan and Pasto. There is a lot to see and do nearby. There are also smaller beach towns that don't have the same issues as Cartagena and your chance of being ripped off is substantially reduced.",46,2025-03-25 23:41:16,maporita

In 2023 I spent about 4 months in Bogota, getting some major dental work done, little bit of golf, little bit of catching up with old friends.   On one of my trips, my USA buddy who is a mid 70s gent on the move - knows decades worth of European hostels, has done the Camino de Santiago quite a few times, always has a function or a trip or zero space on his calendar - tells me that he wants to come down, fly in on the same flight, get a taste of Colombia while he has a friend who will be there.

I had made some reservations in a nice neighborhood, not far from my dentist - looking forward to long morning walks in some nice parks, dinners at some of my old haunts, coffee and catching up with some old dear friends - exactly the opposite of what I knew my buddy was looking for.  I showed him my reservations, and within a day he had kinda bailed on me and my area lol and had contacted a few Colombians he had met in Miami, and a few he knew from the Camino de Santiago.  Turns out I barely saw him in the couple weeks he was there, and I believe he was underwhelmed at the overall experience once we both got back together in US and talked about it.  He attempted to keep it positive, but I have little doubt he will probably never return.  I on the other hand have zero doubts that I will return.  It's not impossible to have a fun filled touristy time in Colombia, but just maybe not as fun filled as many other countries and options in the world.

Here's the thing tho:  Remember it when you get a little older.  Excellent country with a lot to offer for a few months at a comfortable leisurely pace.

Here's an example:

I was once in India and my next destination was China, for which I needed to arrange a visa. The china visa centre was next to a random shopping mall at a suburb of New Delhi that tourists would never go to.

""Wow this shopping mall is so western"", I thought, as I passed all the same shop brands I saw back home in the UK. Topshop, Zara, Dunkin Donuts, etc. 

Then I realised, _everyone there was Indian_. So what the hell is western about it? 

And that's the day I realised there is a strong line of separation between western culture and _consumer culture_.

Consumer culture doesn't care where it is, as long as it can sell to the masses. And I think in a lot of cases when people say something is westernised, what they really mean is that consumerism and globalism has taken hold.

Sure, such things kind of started in the west, but none of it represents the cultural identity of anyone in any western country. You could remove all shopping malls and western culture would remain.

>the corniche was pleasant

When I was in Basrah in 2022, the entire corniche area was under construction and in a shambles. Good to know it's been finished. It's unfortunate that you didn't see anything there-- Basrah has an interesting historic area (UNESCO World Heritage Site), a museum housed in one of Saddam's former palaces, and outside the city are the remnants of Iraq's oldest mosque (only the minaret is left).

>At a checkpoint in the city, we were told we needed an escort (safety?) but the ""helpers"" tried to scam us. 

This was my experience when I visited Samarra in '22. No one (not even Iraqis) could visit the city without hiring a driver. I took a minibus from Baghdad and tried to walk in but to no avail. Fortunately as I was waiting at the checkpoint some European tourists passed by in a taxi and offered to let me ride with them, and we visited the city together and got lunch after.

>Next day exploring on foot was an emotional experience—seeing the bullet-ridden walls and post-war reconstruction, yet life carrying on.

I visited Mosul on my first trip in '22 and then again in '24. You would not believe how much rebuilding and restoration work was done in those two years. Entire areas that were nothing but rubble were entirely transformed, mostly with the help of UNESCO, the Swiss ALIPH Foundation, and the Emirati government.

Hey folks, just wanted to give you all an update and thank you for all the comments, advice, and suggestions you shared. Your support made a big difference in handling this situation!

So, here’s what happened: I managed to reach the Saudia Airlines office, but it wasn’t an easy task. Their office had changed its address, and neither their website nor Google Maps had the correct information. After some local asking around, I finally figured out their new location and headed there.

Once at the office, I presented all my arguments and concerns. However, they were extremely adamant about sticking to the rescheduled flight and almost forcing me to accept it. I stayed firm and pointed out that flights were available for earlier dates, even though they were business class. Unfortunately, they outright refused to upgrade me to business class despite my situation.

After lengthy discussions and a lot of back-and-forth, I finally managed to convince them to book me on a direct flight to Frankfurt with Lufthansa instead. While I’m relieved about this outcome, there’s a small downside: my upgraded baggage add-on (which I originally purchased) became null and void. They informed me that upgraded add-ons are non-refundable and refused to entertain any refund for that.

Still, considering how stressful this situation was, I’m grateful that it’s resolved, for the most part. I wouldn’t have been able to navigate this without all the helpful advice and encouragement I received here.

Thank you all again, I truly appreciate your time and support. Wishing you all the very best in life. Take care and goodbye!",76,2025-04-03 06:27:08,NaiveCoder786

You can ask them to put you on another flight they can ticket, possibly with a SkyTeam partner.


In short:  most likely no compensation, can ask to reschedule, maybe claim something through travel insurance",16,2025-04-03 04:11:09,protox88
travel,1jq7frm,ml506ki,"**Notice:** Are you asking about compensation, reimbursements, or refunds for delays and cancellations?

You **must follow Rule 4** and include the **cities, airports, flight numbers, airlines**, and **dates of travel**.

If your flight originated from the EU (any carrier) or your destination was within the EU (with an EU carrier), read into [EC261 Air Passenger Rights](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/passenger-rights/air/index_en.htm). Non-EU to Non-EU itineraries, even if operated by an EU carrier, is not eligible for EC261 per Case C-451/20 ""Airhelp vs Austrian Airlines"". In the case of connecting flights covered by a single reservation, if at least one of the connecting flights was operated by an EU carrier, the connecting flights as a whole should be perceived as operated by an EU air carrier - see [Case C367/20](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=233901&pageIndex=0&doclang=en&mode=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=676147) - may entitle you to compensation even if the non-EU carrier (code-shared with the EU carrier) flying to the EU causes the overall delay in arrival if the reservation is made with the EU carrier.

If your flight originated in the UK (any carrier) or your destination was within the UK (with a UK or EU carrier), or within the EU (on a UK carrier), read into [UK261 by the UK CAA](https://www.caa.co.uk/passengers/resolving-travel-problems/delays-and-cancellations/making-a-claim/). **Note**: this includes connecting flights from a non-UK origin to non-UK destination if flown on a UK carrier (British Airways or Virgin Atlantic). For example JFK-LHR-DEL is eligible for UK261 coverage.

travel,1ju6gd5,mlzpbzc,"First of all,  great job doing the work to plan! That’s so much work. 

The FIRST rule of international travel is that very little will go according to plan. 

The second rule is to be flexible because very little will go according to plan. 

The third and final rule is to go easy on yourself through the trip because things will go wrong. International travel is hard. People’s first several trips abroad are the hardest because they haven’t learned to flow with all the ways things can and will go wrong. Your experience is typical of first time travelers. I’ve literally been all over the world and still feel like I’m honing my skills as a traveler.

travel,1ju6gd5,mlzrksz,"Brotha, it happens to the best of us. You'll laugh about it later. I took my mom to Guatemala and Mexico and it was like an old Chevy Chase movie.

The airline told me she wasn't coming that day, so I didn't show up. She did. Somehow she gets to the town from the airport. Eventually they get ahold of me. When I arrive she's just standing in the street in Antigua looking panicked. Not the best start. 

Even though I sent her the itinerary to her ok, she wasn't able to do a lot of things I planned. She could barely walk around the town due to her physical condition. And there was a lot of walking and stairs to be done. It exhausted her and she tried, but you could tell she was not having much fun. 

At one point she was surprised by a scorpion in her room. Another room the massive ceiling fan fell down to chest level but kept spinning! She had to hold on for dear life going up to one of the of lava fields and was too tired to ride back down. Me and the guide had to basically carry her down.

The worst part of all, the last three days was like a beach relax time...I thought it would be a funny experience to book us a party hostel. I thought maybe we would be included, have an unexpectedly good time somehow...We all hated it. It was terrible. At one point, eating a pizza buffet with all the 18 year old British asshats, I asked my mom on a scale of one to hate this place how did she feel lol. She replied, "" I fucking hate it!""

I felt bad, as I really did want to show my mom some of the beauty in the world, which she did enjoy some, but couldn't enjoy a lot due to being in pain and exhausted. She swears she had a good, but admittedly hard, time and enjoyed it still.... We laugh a lot about it now, but I can assure you, it took some time.",34,2025-04-08 06:19:28,TriggerEatsTheWolf

Another thing is: Tour packages often are cheaper than individual travel.

They also get discounts on tickets. And the guides are often people who focus on stupid tour jokes instead of knowledge about the places you visit.

travel,1jtohk1,mlvs4x6,"First trip to Europe in 1999. 20/21 years old. Traveled with 4 friends.

What was supposed to be a 2 week epic vacation to see our favorite soccer clubs and maybe some Europe tourist highlights in between, turned into a solo 3 month backpacking adventure on a budget of $3,500 - the same budget my friends said was the MINIMUM to have for their 2 week trip.

We spent that first 2 week together, but they were not convinced $3,500 could last 3 months, and luckily i'd stumbled across Rick Steves' 'Europe Through the Back Door' weeks before the trip was to start. I devoured that book in a weekend and by that following Monday was trying to convince my friends to change plans for an entire summer. None did, but I went out to buy my first backpack, a eurail pass, a $365 round-trip, open-ended, standby plane voucher, and money belt.

I met tons of other travelers like me backpacking through Europe. I saw a lot soccer with my friends. Lost a friend one week into the trip. Slept in hostels, with family, on trains, on benches, in a zoo. Was woken up by the roar of a lion. Rolled into my grandmother's home town hoping to see the home she crew up in, but finding unknown living family that welcomed into their home fro 3 days. Stayed with family on my father's side in Scotland. Spent a week at a sheep croft with my cousin's Gaelic speaking in-laws.

That trip taught me that you don't need a lot of money to travel Travel is easier and safer than so many people make it out to be. People are genuinely friendly and things tend to work out for the best even when they seem to be going wrong at the time.

For 25 years I've been chasing that trip and have been obsessed with budget European Travel. I've devoted time to help others plan similar trips over the years, and build a travel app to help people travel to Europe affordably and with confidence.

That single trip changed the trajectory of my life - for better or worse - and it was all because i found a random book in a library by 'some guy' named Rick Steves.",203,2025-04-07 16:03:28,NiagaraThistle

People acted like I was going to an active war zone and like I was beyond reckless for going alone. Yet, I had a great time, and it's one of my favourite memories ever.


I HATE making decisions and used to ask a ton of people for opinions. It really helped me learn not to seek validation from other people on what to do with my life. That unless someone has the same goals as me or have done similar, to take advice huge grain of salt. Different people want different things from life, nbd.

We exchanged numbers as we'd gone to the bar for live music and it was cancelled short notice so he said he'd let us know when they were perform.

Casually talked and I think he met me and my friend with his friends for drinks once. We returned to the bar a couple of times as he'd informed they were definitely gonna have live music.

We shared a hug, nothing more and didn't think much of it. 

He'd text occasionally and then he invited me out for a massive festival they had. Told me, if accommodation was gonna be an issue I could stay with his family and I'd have my own room etc. Went back out with a different friend (we stayed in a hotel) and the festival was amazing. We hung out loads and maybe a couple of nights before we left we were sitting outside my hotel just chilling and he kissed me and told me ""he really liked me and wanted to give an LDR a try but didn't know how I felt"". I said I liked him and was open to see where it went.

Went back home and communication was more regular and he wanted me to meet his family properly and invited me for Christmas. It was lovely and his family were so welcoming. He then told me ""one day I'm gonna marry you"" - I laughed and was like ""sure, we'll see""

Just a warning for people visiting SK in the future, while Myeongdong is one of the top recommendations, specifically for street food, I highly recommend against going there for the street food. This place has become extremely touristy and the street food is not... well, Korean. It's instead aimed at tourists, so it's stuff that might seem Korean to foreigners and is priced at tourist prices.


Myeongdong has lots of hotels and it's a convenient area to stay, and there ARE some good restaurants (look for the ones full of Koreans) but the main street has become a tourist trap with >90% foreigners.


Itaewon is essentially ""little America"" and is full of expats and US soldiers. That said, it's a popular destination for young Koreans to go out at night, and if you want to meet some locals, it might be the easiest place to do so. It's also the only place in Korea you can go just to get a beer or alcoholic drink without the expectation you'll order food as well (if you go to a normal Korean bar and order just alcohol, it's considered rude and taboo.)

travel,1k0pu85,mnfxym1,"Honestly it is a problem in some cities / areas, and I don't want this to come across as 'victim blaming' because people should be able to travel and enjoy visiting places without falling victim to these scum. However...

A lot of it can be avoided with basic common sense. When I was last in Prague, for example, we were walking across Charles Bridge on a busy day - so prime pickpocketing weather - and still see tourists (a group of American girls in this case) walking along with iPhones half sticking out of their back pockets. I mean you can't be surprised when it gets stolen if you're going to be that blasé, honestly..

Best advice is 1. keep your valuables (phone, wallet, keys, in a zipped pocket or bag, and keep your hand firmly over the zip when you're in a crowded or busy area; 2. don't walk around with your phone casually in your hand, or stand using it in an open / crowded place - basically any situation where it could be easily grabbed by someone passing by (leaving phones and bags on street café / restaurant tables is another obvious one).

I'd advise against wearing or carrying any particularly obviously valuable items too - I mean everyone has expensive phones nowadays so that's generally expected, but eg. I wouldn't walk around London, Paris, or Rome wearing a Rolex or carrying a Hermes bag (my partner for that one, not me).

They'll always go for the easiest target / opportunity, so just basic measures and common sense to ensure you're not that target, you'll more than likely be fine.",39,2025-04-16 17:27:05,IC3Ky

The chef then apologized to us, seated us and said in perfect english ""we cannot feed you yet...but you can have wine!""


THEN he starts singing ""I'll be there for youuuuuu"" (friends theme song) and continued to sing various tv show themes to us all night. He told us that is how he speaks English so well, tv shows.

*I went to Hurghada with another female friend of mine, instead of staying at hotels or resorts we opted for an Airbnb in a higher end residential apartment complex.
We only ate at restaurants/cafes which had good reviews on Google, ordered from Talabat many times and had zero stomach issues. I avoided drinks with ice in it, and drank so much fresh juice. Ate all kinds of fruit and salads with no issues. Although later i got to know my coffee was made with tap water and i drank that two times a day 😅
I only got ripped off one time, with a vape i brought which was supposed to be 1000 puffs but finished in half a day. It might not be the sellers fault,because he opened the package in front of me. 
Before i brought anything i checked the price on Talabat (which is generally more expensive because its a delivery app) and never paid anything more than the price on the app. 
Used Uber everywhere with card payment,never took local taxis.
Instead of buying a sim card at the airport,i brought one in the city at the Orange store for the same price they listed on their website.
Got 7GB internet package with sim card for 250 egp or something. 
The hustlers didn't bother me much, they are just doing their job,why hate on them? 
Just don't engage, and keep on walking.
At Karnak Temple we got approached by a security guard offering to take our pictures which we didn't want at first but somehow he managed to take my phone and snap a few pictures, well i got a few okay-ish pictures and paid nothing to him,because thats not how it works.
Never spoken to any taxi driver,wait staff or shop keeper outside of the necessity, and definitely didn't smile or joked/laughed with any man. Kept the talking brief and maintained a stone face at all times. Never got harassed.
I had a really amazing vacation ❤️

It was a bit suspicious when one of the destinations on our tour was the back room of an old temple that had to be unlocked by the groundskeeper. Not another visitor anywhere. But... there were old statues in there and it was kind of cool. 

Eventually, he brought us back to our hotel. He didn't ask for anything. We gave him a modest tip, but... no problems. It all seemed suspicious though.

So we looked it up online that evening. It was a scam - we went to all of the same locations listed in the typical scam (including the back room), but somewhere along the way, the scam failed.

travel,1jk6tle,mjswr87,"I spend 6+ months away from the uk, mostly Asia and am prescribed over ten cardiac meds for daily dosing (which, whilst staring down the barrels of 60yo doesn’t stop me from hooning round India on trains with a backpack like a Zoomer on a gap year- people take note if you think you’re ‘too old’ or it’s ‘too late’). 

You’re correct, the NHS will give you 12 weeks supply of most meds. You’ve a couple of options and they’re all finance dependent. Most obvious is to engineer it that you’re close enough to nip back home without breaking the bank and collect another 12 weeks or if it’s not a chore get them there.

You could also get a private consultation and private prescription in the uk before leaving for the *next* twelve weeks but that’s comparatively pricey. 

If you’re going to Asia first I’d do a little research & seek out a good medical centre (and contrary to ~~~Reddit~~~ popular perception there’s *plenty* of top-notch medical facilities) soon after you arrive and consult a doc who’ll be happy to sort you out and supply you from the unit’s pharmacy. That’s what I do, then I’ve six months supply, ready to roll and peace of mind. 

Beware: in much of Asia unscrupulous pharmacists will sometimes supply you with whatever the fuck you want, for the right price. Whilst this can be handy for a cheeky Xanax after three sleepless nights of cars honking and dogs barking, do **NOT** be tempted to short-cut the doctors consultation in this regard, in some places ~60% of meds on sale have been found to be counterfeit. Whilst this doesn’t mean they aren’t what they purport to be it’s not worth taking the risk. A reputable unit will see you right though. Thailand & Vietnam for example, you’ve no worries. Cambodia and India, buyer beware but both of those countries also  have *excellent* medical facilities nonetheless. Local knowledge is valuable. 

I’m well used to traversing difficult travel with health issues so if you need to know anything else feel free to dm.

I was never able to get a foreign doctor to honor my US prescription. In Aus/NZ it's flat out illegal, and in SEA it just never seemed to work.

The ""excessive mold infestation"" is a strip of mold about 10 cm long on the bathroom baseboard underneath the sink. The ""structural damage"" are two holes in the wall for cable and telephone lines; calling that structural damage is a huge exaggeration. The ""broken plumbing"" is what appears to be a slow-draining sink. Regarding the 40 steps, unless they claimed that the room you booked was accessible-compliant for those with mobility issues, that's kind of your fault for assuming and not doing research.

travel,1jwru1j,mmkxjoa,"Story time, myself and a friend went to Spain a few years ago. We live in different cities, but we planned it to have the same connecting flight out of Minneapolis, and were to meet up there.

I booked my flights direct with the airline, and he booked his through Expedia. Without going into irrelevant details, we both barely missed our flights that morning, in that our respective planes hadn't left yet but we both arrived to our respective airports too late to get through security on time.

The ticket agent at the airport I was at was able to get me on the next flight to Minneapolis, and only charged me the cost of the flight for that one leg, and I was able to keep the second leg as if nothing happened. My friend, however, had to pay for his entire flight again which was $$$ for buying a ticket on the spot, and the airline didn't get him out until the next day. In the end, he paid a small fortune to get to Madrid, and missed a day on top of it.

I realize that neither one of us should have shown up to the airport late, but the point of the story is, how much the airline can help depending on if the tickets were bought direct or through an external site. Customer service that can actually solve problems is more valuable to me than saving a couple of dollars by using those sites. If you made it this far, thanks for reading lol

Edit to add, also a shoutout to KLM. I once missed a flight out of Toronto going to Manchester. I called their customer service line, told them I'm an idiot and I can't read a calendar, and help?? They got me on a flight out the next day, but I had to go to Glasgow instead. Absolutely acceptable. And they only charged me for a ticket change instead of an entire new flight. I asked for nothing, feeling stupid and thinking I'd have to buy a new ticket, but the lady at the other end of that phone call restored my faith in humanity for a little while.",12,2025-04-11 15:48:37,2948337

travel,1jndg7u,mkixbzk,"A lot has to do with the ingredients, their seasonality, and their freshness.

My experience is all within Europe, but for example tomatoes don't grow easily in the UK, and what you get in the supermarket tastes of nothing year-round, unless you buy the top-of-the-range on-the-vine, organic, etc... The reason it's year round is because the UK supermarkets will import from Spain, Morocco, Argentina, etc, as the year goes around, and especially the cheap range gets brought in chilled from far away.

By contrast, go to Greece, and any mini market or stall will have AMAZING tomatoes at the heart of summer. They've been grown down the road with loads of sunlight, they're in season, picked hours/days ago, never seen a fridge, etc. You literally can't get bad tomatoes then. But in winter? Lots of places won't sell tomatoes, and for those that do (supermarkets) the situation is like the UK, tomatoes are all tasteless coming from other countries.


My guess is that the US is like the UK and you don't really experience the seasonality of things as much, because the supermarkets change their suppliers: but the constant is that the ""cheap range"" will always be chilled shit from away",111,2025-03-30 14:49:43,Stamagar

Now is a great time to learn to drive. You say that you have some friends who drive. Head out of the city for a few weekends and let them teach you how to drive in some quiet areas. I think you will find it to be not as hard as you are imagining it to be. I learned to drive in high school in driver’s education class. Our total time behind the wheel was no more than 6-10 hours (it was a long time ago so I can’t remember exactly). After that get a book to help you with the written test. Practice with a friend, study for the test, and go try for your license.

Now, since you are not a citizen (I assume), there may be some requirements I am not aware of. If so, I apologize for this suggestion.

However, I believe you have time to accomplish this goal before summer. Once you have your license, exploring the US will really open up opportunities for you.

When I did that train ride, I saw all this cool shit I wanted to do and see and was stuck for days on a train!!! No!!!!

If I were in your shoes, I’d see if my friends (who can drive) wanted to meet somewhere and rent a car and if they do the driving (since you can’t) then you can pay for all the gas.

The difficulty is going to be the small towns you want to visit. There won't be a consistent answer for those; options vary greatly based on destination. I'm in Seattle, so I'll use that as an example. For smaller towns on the Olympic Peninsula, you can often take a ferry from Seattle that will connect with transit on the other side of the water and get you to a lot of places. Not every place, but a fair number.

For other destinations, you may be able to take transit to the furthest station and get friends to do some of the drive to pick you up.

I overstayed 2 days on a month visa (during covid time, so there was only 1 month visa available). Since my plan was to stay for 3 months I had to do a visa run once a month, which means I had to exit vietnam at a land border (cheapest way) and reenter for a new month in vietnam. 
 
Drove for 8 hours to Laos border, got denied exit due to overstay. Got directed to contact nearest police station which was 3 hours drive back. It was a Friday and when I got to the city the station was closed. Talked to some guy that talked to some other guy etcetc. After an hour or so I finally got the whatsapp of a police officer who spoke english. Told me to not leave the province and to come back to the police station to pay a fine (more symbolic than anything: about 500k dong). Found an airbnb because ofc the police stations immigration stuff is closed during the weekend, stayed and explored the small rural city over the weekend  
 
Monday I go to the police station. Took me a few hours of talking to police, making a statement and promising to not do it again. They sent me to a bank that handles fines, paid the fine, got documentation and back to the police i went. They stamped my passport for +7 days to exit the country. Drove to Laos the same day. Exited and reenter vietnam in like an hour. Drove back to my gf.

About 5-6 rather slow and painfully boring days due to really bad timing, but I learned my lesson. Dont overstay. I can only imagine 22 days got you in slightly more problems with a bogger fine and way more paperwork.
 
As for advice, I dont have any. 90% of the time ppl spoke vietnamese around me and I just did whatever I was directed to do.

Sri Lanka and waking up to hike Adam’s Peak. Second place was doing what I called the ‘triple crown’ which was Little Adam’s peak, Diyaluma and Ella Rock in a day.

There are small ""resorts"" but they were like backpacking hostels. Super super cheap, people from all around the world. Also the beaches were freaking beautiful. Warm clear blue water, and at many point I or me and friends were the only ones on these beautiful beaches.

* Laetoli and the Olduvai Gorge (Tanzania).  The Hominina footprints at Laetoli and hominid fossils in the gorge give incredible glimpses into early human evolution.
* Uruq in Southern Mesopotamia - arguably the first city in the world (maybe 5,000 B.C.). Centre of vast trading networks, sophisticated craftsmanship, and, not least, where the Bronze Age and agriculture probably started. It also has the earliest examples of writing and records the first known named individual.
* Egypt, Greece and Italy - naturally! Focus on architecture, medicine and mathematics and philosophers.
* Jerusalem and Mecca - the places where Christianity and Islam started. Arguably, a visit to the Indus River Valley would also be in order.
* Ulugh Beg's observatory in Samarkand, Uzbekistan - started in the 1420s but much more than just a site for astronomical observations (notably Beg determined the length of the sidereal year and was only out by 58 seconds). Essentially, it was a university and scholars - both men and women - travelled across continents to study there.
* Timbuktu manuscripts in Bamako (Mali). They range from the late 13th Century and, while many remain to be deciphered,  cover art, medicine, philosophy, and science
* St. Mark's Basilica Venice (Italy) - for a performance of music by Monteverdi or one of the Gabriellis. Polyphonic sound at its finest!
* Mainz, Germany - to see where Gutenberg developed moveable type printing (and for its under-rated wine!).
* Trinity College , Cambridge - plenty of contributions to human advancement (e.g. 34 Nobel laureates) but the focus would be on Isaac Newton and 'Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica'. 
* Paris - with a focus on its 18th-century salons and the French Revolution / the rise of egalitarianism
* St. Petersburg University (Russia) - to see where Dmitri Mendeleev came up with the periodic table of the elements.
* Down House (England) - where Charles Darwin came up with the concepts associated with evolution.
* The classical gardens of Suzhou (China). Suzhou was the largest non-capital city in the world for much of the 19th century and had immense cultural influence. Its many gardens are exquisite - as are its waterways. Also a major site of the Taiping Rebellion, which killed \~20-30 million people.
* The Ironbridge Gorge (England) - the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution.
* The Killing Fields of Cambodia - because it seems we constantly need to be reminded of genocide.
* Stanford University and Silicon Valley (US) - the place where both genetic engineering and various computer tech innovations originated.

travel,1jt28g6,mlug3zn,"I don't think there's a good answer to this. But I do think it's a good thought exercise.

First, the meaning of ""cultured"" at the time of the old Grand Tour is probably not what most of us might have in mind today. Since it was people from Europe traveling almost exclusively through Europe, it was a necessarily narrow view of culture.

Second, I think the goal is nebulous. What does it mean to be cultured or well-rounded in today's society? More to the point, in which society in today's world?

So this necessarily depends on the person, but it's something for each person to think about. The best I think I could say generally is for someone to seek out destinations and cultures that are different from their own. To step out of one's comfort zone and embrace the unknown. Rick Steve's once wrote:

>Culture shock is a constructive thing. It’s the growing pains of a broadening perspective. To me, there are two kinds of travel: There’s escape travel, and there’s reality travel.

travel,1k24xal,mnrf8t9,"It's worth noting that, while Kyushu is underrated with Western tourists, it's popular with Korean and Chinese tourists. So even when one thinks they're going to ""secret"" places in Kyushu because of the lack of mention on the English internet, they may be sites well-trodden for tourists of other countries. 

I visited Kyushu for a month in November, I think it was 2018. From personal experience, of the places I visited, here's how I'd define them:

- **Crowded sites in Kyushu**: Dazaifu, Kitakyushu (crowded around Mojiko, but the centre with the castle and toilet museum was okay), Yufuin (total tourist town, has become a bit kitsch), Nagasaki (tourists, but also many school groups), Beppu, Takachiho (mostly the gorge, the surrounding area is okay), Aoshima (also beach areas were quite dirty)

That said, while I would eagerly encourage you to skip both Dazaifu and Yufuin, I found Nagasaki very interesting despite the crowds due to its unique history, and Takachiho was very beautiful (I walked from the gorge to Amano Iwato Shrine, which turned out to be quite far, but nice scenery of rice fields and quiet restaurants). I haven't been to Aso area so can't comment.

- **Popular places but not overly crowded**: Mt.Unzen, Yūtoku Inari Shrine, Yanagawa, Kumamoto, Kagoshima, Sakurajima, Kirishima Mountains

I loved all those places. For Sakurajima, crowds can be avoided by taking one of the first ferries to the island; I was alone most of the morning walking the lava trail and around town, but doing the loop bus to the volcano viewpoint was quite crowded. Worth it though. Yanagawa is very popular, esp.with Japanese tourists, but people are confined to boats so walking around is very easy and it doesn't feel like there are many people. In the mountains, Kirishima shrine itself was popular, beyond that some trails like Mt. Takachiho-no-mine had some Japanese tourists, so I've put it in ""popular places"", but it was easy to find time alone going for a walk and most hot springs are empty. If you're there for a few days, it will feel very quiet. I slept in Maruo Onsen.

- **Had a couple Japanese tourists / I was alone**: Takeo Onsen, Yoshinogari site, Shimabara, Arita pottery town, Saga city, Chiran, Hyuga National Park, Miyazaki city (it's a city so there's people, but I saw no other tourists beyond the station, everyone seemed to be on buses going elsewhere and sites in the city were empty), Udo jingu

There are always festivals, but what month/dates are you visiting? ""Autumn"" can mean September-December...

There are also some beautiful temples that are great in the fall. Last fall, I visited Hashikuraji and Tairuiji. I can highly recommend those, but there are plenty more all over. Timing of the autumn leaves will depend on the particular area you visit, but you should look up the historical timing, because they are beautiful. There are several tracking websites for this. [Walkerplus](https://koyo.walkerplus.com/) is one that I've used in the past.

There is a lot of culture and history in Shikoku. There are several historical castles, for example. Kochi Castle and Matsuyama Castle are the big names, but Imabari Castle, Ozu Castle, and others are also very cool. You might also like some of the old merchant towns. Uchiko and Ozu in Ehime, and Wakimachi in Tokushima are very interesting.

It's not exactly the most authentic, because it's a curated outdoor museum, but Shikoku Mura in Kawaga is still a very cool and informative site to learn about the cultural history of this island. And if you go to Takamatsu, you have to visit Ritsurin, one of the most beautiful gardens in Japan.

Note that travel in Shikoku is pretty difficult without a car. So I highly recommend renting one. But it's worth it.

If the Sengoku period is a big motivation for your trip, you might consider something back on the main island (if you haven't already been there): Sekigahara. It's a city in southwest Gifu Prefecture, and it's the site of arguably the most important battle in Japanese feudal history. There's a battlefield museum and some other interesting sites. I haven't actually been there myself, but as I'm also interested in this kind of history, I've been looking into going there sometime soon.",5,2025-04-18 16:54:22,cbunn81

One of my core memories from Kumamoto was hiking up to the local shrine in autumn and how beautiful it was. Note, because it’s less traveled by western tourists parts of Kyūshū requires a bit of Japanese (or a lot of hand gestures, translation apps and patience) to get around. 

Fukuoka has enough to do for a couple of days - great ramen, a few notable shrines and temples, pleasant to walk around. I enjoyed just meandering along the river and along side streets. I visited Dazaifu Tenmangū, for a half day or so. 

Kumamoto City is smaller but still offers a few points of interest worth a couple of days - a castle which parts are original although other parts of have been reconstructed due to time and earthquakes; Suizenji Park is lovely and will be gorgeous at that time of year, there are also a few interesting shrines, the biggest of which, Fujisaki Hachimangu, will host its annual matsuri in September. 

Outside of Kumamoto City you can visit Aso, an active volcano, if it isn’t closed due to toxic gases. The city of Aso is relatively small and easy to explore, it’s perfect for a day trip from Kumamoto City but you can stay overnight in a ryokan if you want the experience. The city boasts one of the oldest shrines in Japan and is worth a visit. You can experience natural onsen there (or in any of the nearby local towns like Kikuchi and Yamaga). Kikuchi Keikoku (gorge) is a beautiful natural gorge set in the mountains of Kikichi gun. It’s a nice place to walk/hike and you enjoy a lunch box along the gorge. The scenery is stunning when the foliage has changed colors.  

Amakusa consists of a series of islands which are part of Kumamoto and was a favorite day trip from the city. The islands are a little tropical getaway in Kumamoto with crystal clear blue water and cute little shops including a number of pottery studios throughout it. 

While in Kumamoto you can check out the local delicacies which includes tonkotsu ramen (similar but still different from Hakata ramen), basashi (saw horsemeat), karashi renkon, etc

Sakurajima is down in Kagoshima and is another active volcano on the island. I don’t remember much else from my trip to Kagoshima other than Sakurajima and that it was a fun (but longer than expected) drive down from Kumamoto.",5,2025-04-19 02:54:50,shikawgo
travel,1k24xal,mnrh8a6,"We visited Onomichi for a couple nights and stayed in a historic tea house before biking the Shimanami Kaido. Onomichi is a wonderful stop full of incredible views, quaint businesses and not as many foreigners. We spent three days cycling toward Imabari. This was one of the most memorable travel experiences of my life with lots of opportunities to connect with locals. We stayed in a cycling lodge one night and then rented a beach house from AirBnb for night two — it was surprisingly affordable and filled with ways to relax, including a jacuzzi tub, a sauna, and access to a rocky beach. We took a train to Matsuyama and stayed one night before renting a car and heading into the mountains of Shikoku. The drive took us through intimidating twisty roads that would narrow to one lane; and through miles-long tunnels. The drive alone was worth it to me. We stopped in quaint villages to eat and explore. We stayed two nights at an older couple's rural cabin perched on a gorgeous river valley. They cooked for us multiple times even though we only ordered one meal. They were super sweet and we enjoyed chatting with them through their outdated translator device. We didn't do much there except relax in their cabin and take walks, which was nice after a hectic travel schedule.

travel,1jm4eep,mkcpw6c,"We travel a lot, and over the years, these have become my favorite/must bring travel items:

* crossbody purse/bag that I have on the plane and when in cities. I feel like I don't look so much like a tourist, and like that I can pull it in front of me in busy areas

* packing cubes. I love that they compress things and keep things organized. Makes packing light very possible and easy.

* laundry sheets - I pack light (almost exclusively a carry-on only) and love when I can do some laundry during my trip, plus they don't count against my liquids. I also bring a handful of clothespins as many Europeans only hang dry laundry.

* I also use non-luquid toiletries - bar style face wash, conditioner & shaving. Powder dry shampoo. Doesn't count against liquids either. You'd have to try to see if you like them, but I do. Obviously, lots of lodging provide some of these things, but not always. 

* Foldable grocery style bag. Most grocery stores in Europe and even many stores in the US don't give bags for free. I bring 2 that fold down tiny and tuck into my purse. If we stop to buy food or snacks or some drinks for our hotel room, this is easy to pull out for easy carrying while walking or using public transport. 

* small zippable vitamins/meds container with 7 days and am/pm sides so I can pack enough for 14 days in something barely bigger than my phone. I like that it zips, so there is no risk of something popping open and spilling pills. 

* a different tiny pill container for things like otc meds - ibuprofen, pepto, cold meds, etc. Easy to grab each trip and have ""just in case"" meds without a bunch of bottles. 

* silicone rings - I don't travel with expensive jewelry, so my husband and I both wear silicone wedding bands. They stretch during flights or when it's hot and we are walking a lot and fingers swell a bit and I never worry about misplacing it

* a set of wireless earbuds and one corded set. The wireless I can attach to my phone on a flight or my husband and I each take one to listen to audio guides while traveling. Wired to connect to in-flight entertainment - not all airlines offer these for free

* international adapter - we have ones that work in almost every county plus have USB & USB-C ports. Bonus is that most cruise lines have American plugs & European plugs - by having this, I have an extra outlet to use

* portable charger - we like the ones with attached cords about the same size as a phone

* small pack of unscented baby wipes. These come in handy often and I like being able to at least wipe down my face & hands as needed on a long international flight

*compression socks - if your feet tend to swell while flying or you don't love getting up while flying, these can really help",4,2025-03-29 13:33:14,UniqueLunch2628

travel,1k3todq,mo5j2c5,"Having taken many cruises, in most cases they will bring people aboard to stamp you in and out, usually including a face-match for it, often for the entry visa, sometimes for the exit if they do it aboard ship (sometimes they do it on land as you're reboarding).

Now...there's plenty of reasons this could have happened. But I'm going to wager that they did this in bulk, without a face-to-passport matching on exit from Ecuador. That means they processed them in bulk basically, and it's entirely possible (though unlikely) that the passport wasn't stamped at all, or that the ink ran out on the stamp and they didn't notice (more likely given how faint some stamps I've gotten have been) as they were processing. Sometimes it happens. Not often, but it does.

That said, when your friend reclaimed his passport at that point (usually on the evening they are leaving the country) he should have checked himself to ensure the stamp was there. This was, indeed, not a cruise line issue. It was likely an honest mistake made by some oversight along the way by the customs folks, and I'm inclined to think that it was rather on your friend to not have checked when he collected his passport as it was returned to him.

Always check, and if it doesn't look right, let someone know then and there. The customs folks don't leave until the very last minute usually, often when the exit pilot disembarks, and they usually embark while underway with the entry pilot, so people are on board for the entirety of the stay, and for at least an hour or two before you dock and up to three hours after you leave depending on circumstances.

As the saying goes, trust but verify. It's much easier to rectify the situation in the moment than it is to try and somehow sort it out an indeterminate period of time later, and a trip to the front desk when you discover what happened, and the customs folks are probably still aboard, will often get the ball rolling.

That said, what I would recommend your friend do, is get the itinerary from that trip, and get in touch with the Ecuadorian embassy or consulate, and see if there's anything that *they* can do to help with the situation. Maybe they can, maybe they can't. But the cruise line is right in that it's now out of their hands.",26,2025-04-20 21:14:53,JDolan283

This 'always book direct' is overplayed. Completely agree for airlines, where you genuinely end up SOL if something goes wrong and the consequences are usually much more inconvenient. But for hotel only bookings, it's much less frequent that issues arise.

There's also no guarantee that this exact same problem wouldn't have happened if they'd have booked direct, given the booking was apparently already cancelled prior to arrival. To not honour a booking because of a contraction of a first name is ridiculous.",26,2025-03-28 15:11:31,jmr1190

My pro tip is to choose the “basic” ticket and add priority boarding later on which gives you the 10kg carry on suitcase. This way it’s cheaper than choosing the “regular” package.

My main gripe with them is the horrible consideration they have for customers. After getting stuck in another country for three days with no vouchers and only a vague promise of a refund which I ultimately didn't get because they considered my new, three-days-later ticket to be enough, I try to avoid flying with them unless I'm prepared for anything. If something happens, there is a non-zero chance that you'll have issues. If nothing happens, it's a very cheap flight, which is definitely a huge win for your wallet.

My recommendation would be to talk to your father, what does he think? Perhaps also consult with his doctor for advice. Talking to your mother about what she thinks is probably also wise, as she knows him well, and knows his limitations. 


If he wants to go to Egypt, maybe a river cruise down the Nile could be more relaxing for him? He would still be able to see sights, and experience a different culture.

Are river cruises within your budget? I took a river cruise in Egypt and some of them are very accommodating. There was a woman with Parkinson’s on our cruise and she had a wonderful time. The river cruises are much better than ocean cruises, because they are much smaller and dock very close to attractions. They are also much easier than trying to use only ground transportation, because your hotel travels with you and will probably be much less stressful for your father. Also, there is a reasonably high chance you will get scammed if you’re doing a trip on your own in Egypt. The European river cruises are also nice.

travel,1jo58q6,mkp5kqh,"Was going to say Boston, but then you said beach. While it is a coastal town, what exactly do you want to do on the beach? If it is sun/sand and sip fruity drinks on a lounger, Boston isn't it. If you want culture, history, walkability, and access to ocean, it is a great place to visit.",32,2025-03-31 15:21:28,kyrosnick

travel,1jo58q6,mkpks0p,"I've found chicago to be very walkable. I pit in over 30 miles waling two weeks ago, and it was a pleasure. I stayed near Loyola campus ans walked downtown with no issues. Plenty of shops, social life and great city views. The parks are all daisy chained and can create a wonderful walking experience. Free zoo right in the middle!",10,2025-03-31 16:37:32,diegothengineer
travel,1jo58q6,mkp3aap,"Bethany Beach. Its a quiet beach town in DE. Small boardwalk, and playground a couple blocks away. Sandwich between Ocean City MD, and Rehobeth, DE. Both have bigger boardwalks and more excitement. 

Bethany is good for families with toddlers, Ocean city is for families with teens or young adults. Rehobeth is a bit of both, but I don't know it as well.",18,2025-03-31 15:09:53,Junglepass

travel,1jo58q6,mkq8608,Traverse City Michigan - don’t need a car if you stay downtown and can walk to beach and playgrounds but the weather on Memorial Day could be mid 60s (but getting warmer each year),5,2025-03-31 18:33:03,trixie6
