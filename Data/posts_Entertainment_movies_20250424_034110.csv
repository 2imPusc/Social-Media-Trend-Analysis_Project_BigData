movies,1jmikp3,This Studio Ghibli AI trend is an utter insult to the studio and anime/cinema in general.,"What's up with these AI Ghibli pics recently? Wherever I go, I just cannot escape it. Being a guy who loves the cinematic art in any form, seeing this trend getting this scale of traction is simply sad. I have profound respect for the studio and I  was amazed by their work when I discovered movies like Castle in The Sky, Grave of the Fireflies, Spirited away, etc. And when I got to know how these movies are made and how much manual effort it takes to produce them, my appreciation only increased. But here comes some AI tool that can replicate this in a matter of minutes. This is no less than a slap on the faces of artists who spend hours imagining and creating something like this. 

I am not against AI, or advancements it is making. But there must be a limit to this. You can cut a fruit as well as stab someone with a kitchen knife. Right now, it is the latter happening with the use of AI tools just for cheap social media points. Sad state of affairs.

What do you think? Do you guys like his trend? ",34892,0.73,5250,2025-03-29 09:27:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jmikp3/this_studio_ghibli_ai_trend_is_an_utter_insult_to/,Funendra

movies,1jyt5nj,Hollywood Is Cranking Out Original Movies. Audiences Aren’t Showing Up.,"LOS ANGELES—When director Christopher Landon introduced his new thriller, “Drop,” before its premiere at the Chinese Theater on Hollywood’s Walk of Fame, he had a warning for the packed auditorium.

“It’s really hard out there for an original movie,” he said, urging everyone who liked the Universal Pictures release to “scream it from the rooftops” and on social media.

“Drop” opened this weekend to an estimated $7.5 million domestically, one of two new movies based on fresh ideas that fizzled at the box office. The other was Disney’s “The Amateur,” a spy thriller adapted from a little-known 1981 book, which opened to an estimated $15 million.

After years of gripes from average moviegoers and Hollywood insiders alike about the seemingly nonstop barrage of sequels, spin-offs, and adaptations of comic books and toys, the film industry placed more bets on original ideas.

The results have been ugly. 

Nearly every movie released by a major studio in the past year based on an original script or a little-known book has been a box-office disappointment. Before this weekend’s flops were Warner Bros. Discovery’s“Mickey 17” and “The Alto Knights,” Paramount’s “Novocaine,” Apple’s “Fly Me to the Moon,” Amazon’s “Red One,” and the independently financed “Horizon: An American Saga Chapter 1” and “Megalopolis.”

Jason Blum, who produced “Drop” and built his company Blumhouse largely on original horror franchises, said audiences’ preference for known properties has made it harder to release original movies in theaters, “even though that’s where some of the most exciting and risky storytelling still lives.”

Getting people into theaters more frequently is a priority for a movie industry still recovering from the pandemic. Box-office revenue in the first three months of this year in the U.S. and Canada was the lowest it has been, excluding the pandemic, since 1996.

At the CinemaCon industry convention in early April, theater owners said they welcome more original films, but only if they are backed by robust advertising campaigns. Building buzz for a new film in a media environment fractured between YouTube, TikTok, streaming and sports is tough, particularly when it is an unknown title.

“We’re opening films that have almost zero awareness,” said Bill Barstow, president of Main Street Theatres, a small Nebraska-based chain.

Many consumers are content to wait until an original motion picture is available to rent online a few weeks after its theatrical release or to stream on a service like Netflix in a few months.

The only films succeeding in the current environment are those with built-in audiences, like “A Minecraft Movie,” which was released in early April and has grossed more than $280 million domestically. And these days, even franchises can be far from a sure thing. Long-running series such as Marvel and DC superheroes and live-action remakes of Disney animated classics are showing their age and proving unreliable at the box office.

Studios say they have little choice but to make more original movies they hope will buck the odds.

“Telling original stories and taking risks is the only path toward creating new global franchises,” Bill Damaschke, Warner Bros.’ head of animation, said at CinemaCon.

Some of the increase in original film releases is attributable to Amazon and Apple, which are building film businesses with few well-established franchises. One of the biggest bets on an original film from any company this year is Apple’s “F1,” a June release starring Brad Pitt as a race-car driver.

Amazon hyped 11 coming movies to exhibitors at CinemaCon, of which six were originals. Among traditional studios, Warner Bros. is taking the most risks on originals, with big budget films from directors Paul Thomas Anderson and Maggie Gyllenhaal. 

Hollywood’s next original release comes Friday with Warner’s “Sinners,” a horror movie starring Michael B. Jordan. Next month even Marvel, home to Hollywood’s biggest franchises, is taking a gamble with “Thunderbolts,” about a super team brand new to all but the most devoted comic-book readers.",8127,0.88,3786,2025-04-14 07:31:41,https://www.wsj.com/business/media/hollywood-is-cranking-out-original-movies-audiences-arent-showing-up-cfcf8d75?mod=hp_featst_pos5,OutrageousFootball10

movies,1jwyr9i,Gladiator II made me finally understand the greatness and uniqueness of Russell Crowe's iconic performance.,"When i was a kid and watched Gladiator, i obviously thought Russell Crowe was great as Maximus, but in the following years i never necessarily understood why he won an Oscar for it.

It's not the typical role and performance for which you are considered worthy of an Oscar, it's not a baity biopic about a real-life famous and beloved figure or an arthouse challenging auteur-driven project, it's an heroic figure in a sandal and sword blockbuster.

What could be so great about this performance that you even win an Oscar for it??

I didn't get it until recently when i saw on theaters the awaited sequel.

Gladiator II and Paul Mescal's performance in it (and i really like him as an actor) made me revalue and understand how hard it is to play convincingly an heroic role like that and how easy and effortless Crowe made it look like.

It's an iconic performance that still resonates today, but not necessarily for reasons the general public thinks about.

He managed to do character-actor work, immersing himself into this character and creating a three-dimensional human being out of this two-dimensional role and also imbue it with huge and rugged movie star charisma and such fierce intensity.

With Crowe's presence, there's such depth and gravitas into a role that on paper could have easily ended up being so flat and dull in the hands of many and many other actors, even good ones.

He's stoic, but never dull or uninteresting, he's absolutely magnetic, always elevating every scene with a ferocious potency.

It's almost a throwback to those powerful, big, theatrical, and commanding performances you would see on those sword and sandal epics of the 40s-50s-60s, but updated, modernized, and made accessible for the audiences of the new millennium.

It's a hard feat he pulled off, much harder than many people think, it's simply not a performance you can just imitate and replicate, and watching recently Mescal trying to inhabit that same type of stoic character made me realize it much more.

Russell's performance wasn't just ""playing the hero"" or the good soldier, there was a personality and specific characterization you can't just copy, an entrancingly unique magnetism you can't just hope to recapture on film.

He's not just great, like i always thought, but quite frankly, no other actor in the world could have played Maximus and suddenly turn it into an Oscar winning role.

It's an unusual, unique, and absolutely deserved Oscar win, and a reminder of Crowe's unique talents and why he became a full fledged movie star after always having been a great actor.

I hope one day we will see him again in another role worthy of him and make a great comeback.

movies,1jyp8dp,Actors who were going to be the next big thing and then…just weren’t?,"I consider Clive Owen to be in this category. Nothing wrong with him, he’s a very good actor. But in the 2000s this dude was everywhere. Oscar nominated for ‘Closer’, Children of Men was tremendous, I mean he was heavily favoured to be James Bond before Daniel Craig showed up.

movies,1k2d0zi,Grandma's Boy was way ahead of its time and doesn't get the credit it deserves,"It's a good solid comedy about a group of friends who work at a video game company in the mid 2000s. Waaay before nerd culture became popular and mainstream. It shows the lives of actual nerds before being a nerd became cool. Is it a cinematic masterpiece and the most well written comedy film ever? Of course not. Is it also a stoner movie? Yes. But it isn't a stoner movie in the way Half Baked or Harold and Kumar are stoner movies. And I think that aspect has always overshadowed the fact that it's just an overall good buddy comedy set in a time that is very nostalgic for a lot of people who were in the same age range as the characters at the time the movie was released. The reason I say it was ahead of its time is because you can swap out the video game company in Grandma's Boy with any creative media/internet/journalistic venture that groups of nerd friends have launched over the past 20 years, and it could serve as the exact same kind of backdrop for a similar story. And seeing how having such a venture is the norm these days in nerd culture, you can't deny seeing the makings of that kind of thing in the modern era of pop culture as early on as Grandma's Boy. Like I said, overall it's just a good comedy. But too often it gets dismissed as just being a typical stoner movie.

Edit: Nice to see all the love for Grandma's Boy. ",4101,0.9,575,2025-04-18 19:12:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1k2d0zi/grandmas_boy_was_way_ahead_of_its_time_and_doesnt/,Imbetterthanthis1138

movies,1jjhsrj,Is Robert Patrick the only actor who gets killed by all three Planet Hollywood icons?,"Robert Patrick plays thee characters who get killed by the Planet Hollywood stars in only seven years time.

In Die Hard 2 his character is fatally shot by Bruce Willis’s John McClane.

In T2: Judgment Day his T-1000 is terminated by Arnold Schwarzenegger.

In Cop Land Sheriff Sylvester Stallone uses his shotgun to end his life.

Do you know other actors who met their untimely death by the hand of all three stars that backed the Planet Hollywood restaurants?

UPDATE!

Planet Hollywood was initially backed by Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Willis AND Demi Moore in 1991.

Turns out Robert Patrick also gets whacked by Demi Moore’s Madison in Charlie’s Angels: Full Throttle on top of Griffith Observatory.

That’s four out of four!

But, I'd run out of movies I'd wanted to watch, and I figured I'd give them a re-watch all these years later. Oh, boy, was I impressed. They were all truly a delight to watch from start to finish.

Fortunately, I'd forgotten most of what happens during the films. There are scenes and jokes that I remembered, but they were also fun to watch because they're performed so well. Absolute classics. Then, the rest, had me laughing on the inside and the outside.

Nowadays, there aren't that many movies that I find truly joyful to watch from start to finish, but these movies all met the mark. When I first saw Goldfinger, I didn't even know who Beyonce was xD.

movies,1k32v08,I saw an image of Tim Curry on social media. Which has prompted me to make this post about Tim Curry...,"We all love Tim Curry... but I don't think we stop to appreciate just how amazing he really is. He's an actor, sure... but he can also sing. And sing well! He's willing to undergo makeup and prosthetics to transform himself into crazy characters. But he's also very open to various role offers; from The Hunt For Red October, to Home Alone 2: Lost In New York.


But on top of his amazing live action roles... he is a very prolific voice actor too! Ferngully, Scooby Doo, Wild Thornberrys... if you grew up in the 80s and 90s, dollars to donuts you know his voice! And if you grew up after the 80s and 90s... he has also narrated a few books on Audible. I personally own A Christmas Carol, read beautifully by the man himself!  

He's had a pretty diverse career in TV. Tim even made the venture into video games. Most infamously was Command & Conquer. I don't know much about his career on stage... but apparently he did that too! And two music videos! Thank you, Wikipedia! 


He's worked with Muppets, kids, and even Alec Baldwin! Just goes to show that he is patient and open minded as an actor. But, he's also a very kind person. Seldom will you ever hear anyone say anything but positive things about meeting Tim Curry. He is always very grateful for his career, and has so much time for his fans. 

He has suffered some health problems in recent years... and that sucks. But he hasn't given up! Tim Curry is a fighter and still has all his charm and quick wit that we've come to know him for throughout the years.

I personally will always remember him best from Legend, Muppet Treasure Island, and Home Alone 2... three movies from my childhood. If you line all three of his characters up side by side and told a random person in the street that it was all the same actor... they'd probably laugh in your face. Speaking of laughing... he apparently auditioned for The Joker before Mark Hamill got it. Would've loved to hear that take!


He is the reason so many people are afraid of clowns... but he is also the reason so many people fell in love with his films. 


Tim Curry.

movies,1jvy3xi,Rewatched the Matrix sequels after 2 decades of recovering...,"Tried Reloaded and Revolutions again to see if they felt any different after all this time. My take:

\- Had the third film been good, Reloaded would have probably got a pass as a 'shaky' middle act in a great trilogy

\- Most of the bitter after taste comes from Revolutions

\- There were enough interesting ideas to have it be more than one great film, but the execution collapses

\- Neo and Trinity would be better as friends

\- Smith's character falls apart after the first film, he goes from delightfully cold and efficient, to gimmicky, then weirdly angry

\- Morpheus feels like a passenger with nothing to do, which was a critical mistake

\- We need to care about Zion, but there's no one there that we like. Morpheus could be there, but instead he's flying around on a ship for some reason

\- The architect scene made a surprising amount of sense, if your attention span is on

\- Rehashing the iconic lobby scene in Revolutions was baffling

\- The Zion council is unbearable and speak as if they have access to the film's script

\- The machines don't feel too threatening... they fly around in octopus swarms a lot

\- You could rewrite both Reloaded and Revolutions into great films if you took a different direction",2166,0.88,685,2025-04-10 13:37:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jvy3xi/rewatched_the_matrix_sequels_after_2_decades_of/,Beneficial_Toe_2347

Reviews:

[Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/sinners-review-michael-b-jordan-ryan-coogler-1236363344/) (70):

>It's vibrant and richly acted, and also a wild throat-ripping blowout. But though overloaded at times, it's the rare mainstream horror film that's about something weighty and soulful: the wages of sin in Black America.

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/04/sinners-review-ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan-x-2-reteam-vampire-movie-1236365142/):

>*Sinners* marks another strong reason why Ryan Coogler is at the top of his generation of filmmakers, and Jordan continues to show why he is a real deal movie star.

[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/sinners-review-michael-b-jordan-ryan-coogler-horror-1236186742/) (90):

>The movie is smart horror, even poetic at times, with much to say about race and spiritual freedom. It’s not in the Jordan Peele league in terms of welding social commentary to bone-chilling fear. But *Sinners* is a unique experience, unlike anything either the director or Jordan has done before.

[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1831292/sinners-ryan-coogler-movie-review/) (9/10):

>""Sinners"" is several things at once — a monster movie, a blood-soaked action film, a sexy and sensual thriller, and a one-location horror flick as intense and paranoia-driven as anything from the original ""Assault on Precinct 13"" or Quentin Tarantino's filmography – but its greatest strength comes from how well Coogler blends every big idea on his mind.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/sinners-review-ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan-vampire-horror/) (88):

>“Sinners” is a bloody, brilliant motion picture. Ryan Coogler finds within the vampire genre an ethereal thematic throughline; and within the music genre a disturbing, tempting monster. Stunningly photographed, engrossing cinema — epic to the point where it seemingly never ends, which is undeniably indulgent, but no great sin. This is a film about indulgence, the power indulgence wields and the dangers indulgence invites into our lives. It’s a sweaty, intoxicating, all-nighter of a movie, and its allure cannot be denied.

[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/sinners-movie-2025-michael-b-jordan-cast-ryan-coogler-b2730833.html) (4/5):

>If cinema weren’t in such a sickly state, *Sinners*’s electric fusion of genres – historical epic, horror, and squelchy actioner – would be a guaranteed box office sensation. Instead, the film arrives with an uneasy sense that this is some kind of final stand for original ideas. One can only hope audiences recognise its bounty of riches.

[The Guardian](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/sinners/) (3/5):

>For many, the movie could as well do without the supernatural element, and I admit I’m one of them; I’d prefer to see a real story with real jeopardy work itself out. But there is energy and comic-book brashness

Vanity Fair (80):

> Sinners is propulsive and stirring entertainment, messy but always compelling. The film’s fascinating array of genres and tropes and ideas swirls together in a way that is, I suppose, singularly American.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/sinners-review-ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan-vampire-movie-1235114698/) (83):

>Sinners is nothing if not a film about genre, and the distinctly American imperative of cross-pollinating between them to create something that feels new and old — high and low — at the same time.

movies,1jqil80,"What movies were saved by studio interference, that most people don't realize?","Hey there. So I have recently done a post in this subreddit asking about movies that were ruined by studio interference and meddling.
And I got a comment saying that the opposite isn't talked about enough.
It got me thinking what are some movies that were saved by studio interference/meddling.
The best examples I found of studio interference making a movie better were:
Predator (1987) The Studio insisted that the movie did not have enough gun fight scenes. As a result, McTiernan added the scene where the team looses it shoot their guns off into the jungle in every direction.

Apocalypse Now (1979) The studio insisted that Francis Ford Coppola, reduce the run time by an hour. So he edited out a number of scenes. If you have ever seen Redux you know how good of an idea it was.

The Warriors (1979): The studio made Walter Hill remove the comic book panels that he had originally put in the movie. The director’s cut reinstates the comic-book scenes that Hill wanted and they just don't work.

Alien (1979) The studio (producers Walter Hill and David Giler) added in the character of Ash, which original co-writer Dan O’Bannon felt was a completely unnecessary addition. If They Hadn’t Stepped In: We wouldn’t have had Ash, which means we potentially wouldn’t have had the whole Weyland-Yutari conspiracy plot.

So with these examples out of the way, does anyone have any other examples of movies being saved like this?",2086,0.94,997,2025-04-03 13:34:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jqil80/what_movies_were_saved_by_studio_interference/,miguelrgabriel23

movies,1jt84ve,The Gamble New Line Cinema made making the LORD OF THE RINGS Trilogy was INSANE,"Imagine being New Line founder & head honcho Bob Shaye. It’s circa 1998 & you’ve just been shown a presentation by a kiwi filmmaker most people have never heard of it. You’re shown costumes, weapons, cgi tests, miniatures, all funded by a rival studio that decided it can’t make this project because it’s just too expensive. So said Rival studio boss has given kiwi filmmaker a chance to pitch the project elsewhere. Every studio in town has turned the pitch down since there are some very large strings attached. Rival studio boss must be reimbursed for the millions in spent development costs, he must be given a % of the box office and you only have a 24 hours to decide. You were kiwi film makers last stop before heading back to New Zealand in defeat.

The kiwi filmmaker is pitching you a two film adaptation of perhaps the most well known book trilogies in existence. Your film company needs a hit, badly. After the presentation everyone looks to you for a reaction. “I don’t understand” you say. You see the faces of kiwi filmmaker and his team go white with dread before adding “it’s 3 books? It should be 3 movies”. 

And that’s it. That’s the start of one or the biggest most insane gambles in Hollywood history. The price tag? 270 million. That number will go up before all is said and done. 


Just think about it for a minute. New Line funded the production of 3 films shot back to back in a tiny country halfway around the world, by a director whose never had a hit movie, using unproven technology, with no A List star and if none of it works, the movie doesn’t succeed? You might lose your company. 

The production goes way over budget, loses a main actor after a few days of filming, New Line is constantly trying to mitigate its risk by cutting the runtime down, selling foreign distribution rights(boy will they come to regret that) 

The press is all over New Line. “This is insane”. “It’s going to fail”. “What are they going to do when it does fail” etc. But then…



May 2001 hits. Newline decides to preview 20 minutes of the first movie at the Cannes film festival. This is where everything changed. The public and press got its first real look at the film and the response is better than anyone could hope. New Line loosens up. Gives more money to finish the movie. There some actual buzz & hype now. 

But then 2 things happen. 


One is another highly anticipated book adaptation is coming out a month prior. Basically the hottest property on the planet not named Star Wars or Pokemon. “Harry Potter”. And when it does come out? It has the biggest opening weekend of all time. 

The other thing? Tragedy. 9/11. Do audiences even want to see a movie about wars and elves and hobbits? Will anyone care? 

Boy did they ever. December 2001 the gamble pays off. Whats more? They get 13! Academy Award nominations. It’s now officially a phenomenon.
 
And you’ve got 2 more movies to release. Each more successful than the last, an unheard or rarity for sequels of that era.",1796,0.89,223,2025-04-07 00:00:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jt84ve/the_gamble_new_line_cinema_made_making_the_lord/,MrGittz

movies,1jtyamn,"April 4-6 Box Office Recap: 'A Minecraft Movie' massively over-performs, debuting with a colossal $162.7 million domestically. Worldwide, it earned $313.4 million, the second biggest debut for a video game movie.","https://preview.redd.it/3kitircrohte1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=92e79a33892ca9682412307a2d502234da9c8839

After some very weak months, the box office finally picked up steam with April.

And that's practically all because of ***A Minecraft Movie***, which overcame months of negative buzz to deliver a record opening weekend for a video game adaptation, as well as the biggest debut of the year.

The Top 10 earned a combined $190.8 million this weekend. That's up a massive 135.3% from last year, when ***Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire*** stayed on top, while ***Monkey Man*** and ***The First Omen*** underwhelmed.

Debuting atop, WB's ***A Minecraft Movie*** surpassed all expectations, earning a colossal $162.7 million in 4,263 theaters. That's even bigger than WB's ***Barbie*** ($162 million), and it's only behind ***Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2*** ($169 million) for the studio's biggest debut. The opening is also higher than the previous video game record, ***The Super Mario Bros. Movie*** ($146 million), although ***Mario*** debuted on a Wednesday and burned off demand.

Simply put, it's a fantastic film. Especially after months of negative buzz surrounding the film's trailers. And a much needed win for WB after a slate of disappointing performers like ***Joker***, ***War of the Rohirrim***, ***Companion*** and ***The Alto Knights***.

Back in September 2024, when the teaser trailer debuted, the film earned poor reception, with many criticizing the VFX. To win over audiences for the other trailers, studio marketing suits added more VFX and quelled rabid fans by conveying that their Minecraft will stay true to the game. But that's perhaps the key; people will talk badly about a product, but that buzz translates into awareness, which builds into curiosity.

Of course, not all negative buzz translates into curiosity (***Snow White*** waving in the distance). But the advantage for this film is simply ***Minecraft***. Despite the belief that the game lost relevance years ago, the stats say otherwise; ***Minecraft*** is the best-selling video game of all time, with over 300 million copies sold and nearly 170 million monthly active players as of 2024. Clearly, there's already an audience awaiting for a film, and they happily paid tickets for this. Even lukewarm reviews (48% on RT) didn't dissuade fans from checking it out.

According to Warner Bros., 67% of the audience was male, and 78% was under 25 years old. They gave it a middling ""B+"" on CinemaScore, which is very mediocre for a family film. While word of mouth among children is very positive, adults are less thrilled with the film. We'll see in subsequent weeks how much it drops, but for now, a $450 million domestic total is in the cards for ***A Minecraft Movie***.

Last week's champ ***A Working Man*** added $7.3 million this weekend. That's a 53% drop, which is slightly worse than ***Beekeeper***'s 48% drop. Of course, that film had incredibly weak competition, but it's a sign that the film might not be able to leg out as hoped. Through 10 days, the film has amassed $27.8 million, and it should finish with around $40 million domestically.

In third place, ***The Chosen: Last Supper — Part 2*** earned $6.9 million this weekend. That's down 42% from ***Part 1***'s performance last week. Let's see how ***Part 3*** fares this weekend.

With the arrival of a big blockbuster, ***Snow White*** had another terrible drop this weekend. It fell a rough 59%, earning just $5.9 million this weekend. The film's legs appear to be running out. Through 17 days, the film has earned a terrible $77.3 million and it's gonna finish with less than $90 million domestically. That's absolutely pathetic.

Blumhouse's ***The Woman in the Yard*** added $4.5 million this weekend. That's a 52% drop, which isn't that bad considering the film's poor word of mouth. Through 10 days, the film has earned $16.6 million, and it should pass $20 million by next week.

***Death of a Unicorn*** earned $2.6 million this weekend. That's a 53% drop, which is quite rough for a comedy. Through 10 days, the film has earned just $10.7 million and it will struggle to get to $15 million by the end of its run.

With the arrival of ***Part 2***, ***The Chosen: Last Supper — Part 1*** collapsed a horrible 84% this weekend, earning just $1.8 million. That took its domestic lifetime to $17.9 million after 10 days.

There was another wide release this weekend, Neon's ***Hell of a Summer***. Debuting in 1,255 theaters, it earned an okay $1.7 million. With weak word of mouth and horror/thriller competition on the way, it's gonna disappear quickly from theaters.

In ninth place, Bleecker Street's ***The Friend*** expanded to 1,237 theaters and earned $1.6 million this weekend.

Rounding up the Top 10 was ***Captain America: Brave New World***, which fell 54% and added $1.3 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $199 million and it will crack the $200 million milestone sometime this week.

#**OVERSEAS**

***A Minecraft Movie*** also took over the rest of the world. The film earned a huge $150.7 million overseas, for a $313.4 million worldwide debut. That's the second biggest debut for a video game movie, behind ***Mario***. The best debuts were in the UK ($19.9M), China ($14.5M), Mexico ($11.2M), Germany ($10.6M) and Australia ($8.3M). It still has other markets left, including Japan. We'll see if the film can be strong enough to hit the $1 billion mark.

***Snow White*** is running out of steam and it's already its third week. It added just $9 million overseas, which takes its worldwide total to a terrible $168.6 million.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

None.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

We're getting FOUR wide releases, and none stand a chance in dethroning ***Minecraft***.

The first is 20th Century Studios' ***The Amateur***, which stars Rami Malek as a CIA cryptographer who seeks revenge against his wife's killers. With ***A Working Man*** slowing down, this could be a main attraction for old-school action fans.

Another release is Universal/Blumhouse's ***Drop***, which stars Meghann Fahy as a widow who is contacted by a stranger to kill her date, or her family will be murdered. The film already premiered at SXSW and it has received strong reviews (89% on RT). Can it be the hit that Blumhouse wants and needs?

Another is A24's ***Warfare***, which follows in real-time a platoon of Navy SEALs on a mission through insurgent territory in 2006. It's directed by both Ray Mendoza and Alex Garland (although the latter states his role is more secondary), and it has earned great reviews so far (93% on RT). It's unreasonable to expect numbers similar to ***Civil War***, but perhaps it could be a surprise breakout for A24.

And finally, there's Angel Studios' ***The King of Kings***, an animated film about the life of Jesus Christ. Angel Studios has delivered a big marketing for the film, and pre-sales are reportedly strong here. Maybe it could surprise.

movies,1jik8bc,Could “Hot Rod” be the Best Movie Ever Made? No. But Yes. Probably.,"I came late to this movie. Years late. A decade even. My daughter knew we loved “Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping” thus, she said, we should love “Hot Rod.” 

Bruh.

I never laugh during an initial viewing of a comedy. Don’t know why, but any comedy I see the first time, it might elicit a chuckle here or there, maybe a chortle or a slight guffaw, but that’s about it. “Hot Rod” had me cackling the first time I watched it, and every time I’ve watched it since, I still laugh hard.

So unbelievably quotable… “Cool beans,” “BABE, WAIT, BABE!” “Yoo-hoo shitheads, I found this bag of fireworks in the men's restroom. Would you guys like to light them off?” “Let me join your crewwwWWW?” “I’ve been drinking green tea all goddamn day!” “You guys, the bathroom here is nuts!” “Ultimate punch!” “Pussyyyyyyyyyy…” “I’m Rod and I like to party.” “I said you look shitty! Goodnight, Denise!”

Perfect soundtrack! Effing EUROPE songs throughout. The “You’re The Voice” montage! We know the story takes place in the age of the internet, but when? It’s timeless, sorta. 80s glam metal songs with earnest lyrics, clothes vehicles and houses that could put you in any of the last five decades. 

Still cannot believe this movie even exists. Thank god it does. With all of the frightened studio execs unwilling to take risks on anything because audiences are unpredictable and unreliable, for Paramount to basically go, “OK idiots, here’s $25 million, go make a movie,” it’s baffling to me. It’s also a shame this movie is still not as well known as it deserves. I would have thought, y’know, long tail rules, “Hot Rod” would have made its money back by now.

I’m dropping this here for appreciation of a damn funny movie that deserves more viewers.",1572,0.79,441,2025-03-24 06:16:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jik8bc/could_hot_rod_be_the_best_movie_ever_made_no_but/,BenTheDiamondback

movies,1jle7lo,My interpretation of the car accident in 'No Country for Old Men': Anton Chigurh is a dead man walking.,"There's a famous quote attributed to anthropologist Margaret Mead that the first sign of civilization in archaeology is a healed bone because anywhere else in the animal kingdom a broken bone is a death sentence and only humans working together had the ability to reset the bone and care for the individual while it healed.

We know that when Chigurh gets hurt he'll steal medical supplies and tend to himself. But a snapped arm bone can't really be treated like this and whatever he could do he'd still be left crippled to a point where he's unable to to do the only job he's capable of. Without going to a hospital he'd no longer useful to his employers.  

I don't know if any of this is a part of McArthur's intention. I've seen the interpretation that it's symbolic of the brutality inherent to the world that not even he can escape. But no one else in the story is so acutely vulnerable to this situation as he is; a man who is violently anti-social and entirely self-reliant presented with a situation that requires the willing help of others. And this vulnerability is highlighted by the lengths and pains he has to go to heal a much less serious wound. 

To put it in his terms: if he had been more like his victims, following the rules of society, then those rules would have in fact been of great use to him in that moment. And now it's his own rules that could be said to have ultimately failed him.

EDIT: I forgot to mention he’s a very distinct looking person, wanted for murder, on foot, walking away from a crime scene less than a mile away with a bone sticking out of his arm.",1529,0.9,172,2025-03-27 21:25:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jle7lo/my_interpretation_of_the_car_accident_in_no/,porktorque44

Some Reviews:

[The National - William Mullaly](https://www.thenationalnews.com/arts-culture/2025/04/02/a-minecraft-movie-review/) \- 3/5

>While many bad films are made with love, sequels, spinoffs and big-budget adaptations often make the artform feel inert because they are produced with so little heart that they might as well have been generated by AI. But here's the thing: I actually liked *A Minecraft Movie*. I'm as surprised as you are. This is not a disaster. Not by a mile. In fact, for most of its duration, it's downright charming and, in parts, had me laughing out loud.

[Variety - Owen Glieberman](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/a-minecraft-movie-review-jason-momoa-jack-black-1236352502/)

>Watching “A Minecraft Movie,” we’re always aware that the story is something that’s been grafted onto the world, and that we don’t have much of a dramatic stake in it — that it’s just the film’s way of cobbling together something that “works.” (Which, in its way, is very Minecraft.) Some of this is amusing, but like the rest of “A Minecraft Movie” it never feels like it matters. Yet it’s no insult to say that, in this case, that’s actually true to the spirit of a video game that turns life into a blockhead version of itself.

[The Hollywood Reporter - Lovia Gyrakye](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/a-minecraft-movie-review-jason-momoa-jack-black-1236179043/)

>The most disappointing aspect of *A Minecraft Movie*, directed by the husband-wife duo who go by Jared Hess (*Napoleon Dynamite*, *Nacho Libre*), isn’t that it’s born out of an existing IP. We live in a world of low-effort reboots, unnecessary remakes and movies operating as extensions of corporate brands. Another one of these gluttonous projects is hardly surprising. What makes *A Minecraft Movie* so dispiriting is how it fails to spark the imagination, betraying a core tenet of the game on which it’s based. 

[The Wrap - Michael Ordona](https://www.thewrap.com/minecraft-movie-review-jason-momoa-jack-black/)

>The most accurate summation of “A Minecraft Movie” is probably “It is what it is.” It’s what it’s supposed to be. It probably won’t dig up many new converts to the game, but should strike box-office silver, at least. (And fans, be sure to stick around for two credits scenes – especially the second one.)

[IndieWire - David Ehrlich](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/a-minecraft-movie-review-1235112484/) \- C

>It’s a real credit to Black’s irrepressibly unique comic energy that “A Minecraft Movie” never feels quite as hypocritical as it should. Either disastrously ill-suited for its message about how money is the enemy of joy, or immaculately *well*\-suited for its message about much harder it is to build things than it is to destroy them, Hess’ film can’t help but feel like its very existence is an affront to the creative freedom that has allowed “Minecraft” to become such a vital form of self-exploration for kids around the world (even Warner Bros.’ choice to call it “A Minecraft Movie\*”\* as opposed to “The Minecraft Movie” implies a spectrum of different concepts, despite the reality of a business that can only imagine this one). But Black — whatever his charms, and regardless of how well they’re deployed here — is a living testament to the idea that people can still thrive by staying true to their own expression. If not in this world, then perhaps in one of their own design. 

[IGN - Jesse Hassenger](https://www.ign.com/articles/a-minecraft-movie-review-jack-black-jason-momoa?utm_source=instagram,threads,twitter) \- 6/10

>For a big-studio adaptation of a massively popular video-game, A Minecraft Movie lets a surprising amount of its director’s personality shine through. Napoleon Dynamite’s Jared Hess manages to fit some laugh-out-loud silliness into his Overworld saga before surrendering to the obligations of CG-driven fantasy adventure. Thematically, A Minecraft Movie offers a pat world-is-what-you-make-it lesson, but Jack Black and Jason Momoa in particular sell it with a lot of comic enthusiasm.

[AV Club - Jacob Oller](https://www.avclub.com/a-minecraft-movie-review)

>One could rightfully question pretty much all of *A Minecraft Movie*, a formulaic template ornamented with surrealism. Some moments bear the scribbled signature of a filmmaker with offbeat passions. These are quickly plastered over by the hotel artwork of a four-quadrant IP extravaganza—and even the by-the-numbers sequences seem jumbled, out of order, or repeated. Yet, there’s something fitting about this film’s contradictions. *Minecraft* is fertile ground for innovation and exploitation. It’s adaptable, limited mostly by those playing it. One can build something personal, copy something mass produced, or attempt to tweak one with the other. Those behind *A Minecraft Movie* saw infinite possibilities laid out before them and—unlike another adaptation of a popular building pastime, *The Lego Movie*—opted for the one that’s been made a thousand times before.

[New York Post - Johnny Oleksinski](https://nypost.com/2025/04/02/entertainment/a-minecraft-movie-review-idiotic-video-game-film-stomps-on-your-brain/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=nypost) \- 1/4

>Your noggin will certainly be done in by Steve and Garrett (Momoa) flying through the air in a risque position suggesting a sex act. Really, “A Minecraft Movie” a 101-minute lobotomy. Put that on the poster. For the uninitiated, the Overworld — I’m pretty sure — is a pixelated place where a player can erect buildings, create tools and design weapons out of blocks. The rules are unclear, as the filmmakers picked silliness over storytelling. Stacking cubes would not, at first glance, seem like a strong plot to hang an action-adventure film on, however “The Lego Movie” did so with cleverness, heart and humor. Trust me: “The Lego Movie” is “Lawrence of Arabia” next to “Minecraft.”

[Next Best Picture](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/3046) \- [Giovanni Lago](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/giovanni-lago) \- 3/10

>There’s a world where “A Minecraft Movie” actually backs the idealism of creativity, which it so proudly boasts in its barebones story. Maybe if the film were animated, it could’ve played far better to the concept of endless possibilities and allowed for a far more visually dazzling spectacle. Inherently, maybe it would never even be possible, as the idea of creativity can only be celebrated as little as possible when it’s given the parameters of being in such a lazy ip scrape of the barrel as this. There used to be a time when a majority of children’s films were made with such care and intention. Now it seems all you need is buzzwords, celebrities, and “Avengers: Endgame” clap-inducing moments, all of which “A Minecraft Movie” has, unlike a soul, which at least the game feels like it possesses.

[The Daily Beast](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2345) \- [Nick Schager](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/nick-schager)

>So sloppy is *A Minecraft Movie* that it can’t keep track of its various concerns, highlighted by a mirthless subplot—in which Jennifer Coolidge’s vice principal picks up and woos an Overworld resident who’s traveled to our universe—that it basically drops around the midway point. Buried deep within Hess’ wannabe blockbuster is a message about how creativity is cool and, thus, so too are outcasts. Yet nothing about this hodgepodge fits together. *Minecraft* enthusiasts will be pleased by the film’s various nods to its multiplatform predecessor. Nonetheless, shouting out isn’t the same thing as faithfully celebrating and translating, and those with no experience assembling towers, villages, and weapons in Mojang Studios’ sandbox will undoubtedly find it all scattershot and wearisome. It’s proof that you can build it, but that doesn’t mean anyone—much less newbies—will come.",1345,0.89,1223,2025-04-02 18:59:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jpwpq1/a_minecraft_movie_review_thread/,ChiefLeef22

movies,1jxmkqd,Terminator 2 hits so much harder as an adult.,"I was born in 1993, my first time watching Terminator 2 was with my family (when age appropriate, probably 10 years old or so lol) in preparation for us going to the Universal Studios theme park where they had the Terminator 3-D experience (does that even exist anymore?). 

My brothers and I became obsessed and would literally put the DVD in just to watch the Minigun/Helicopter scene or the Motorcycle/Truck chase through the storm drains. 

Watched it with my wife last night, it’s probably been at least 15 years since I watched it front to back, I could still quote most lines but now that I’m an adult with a career, wife and pets that depend on me it felt completely different. 

The scene that hit me the hardest was Sarah Connor attacking Miles Dyson’s house. The man is brilliant, successful, has a beautiful house/family and is a part of a groundbreaking technology but also oblivious to the potential that this technology makes him “responsible for the death of 3 billion people” because it hasn’t happened yet. Why would he have thought of that? At the end he’s willing to sacrifice himself for the good of mankind. 

Skynet doesn’t even feel that farfetched at this point, in fact it’s probably going to be worse considering there’s no politics involved in the movie. 

I feel like my perspective on the movie completely changed from someone that idolized Arnold for being a badass to realizing how scary the reality is of the situation. 

All of this is not mentioning the acting, special effects cinematography and everything that helped make the movie such an incredible experience. I hate to say it but it’s as close to a perfect movie if I’ve ever seen one.

**Rotten Tomatoes:** [93%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/warfare)

**Metacritic:** [78/100 ](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/warfare/)

Some Reviews:

[IndieWire](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/226) \- [David Ehrlich](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/david-ehrlich) \- B-

>“Warfare” is a film that wants to be felt more than interpreted, but it doesn’t make any sense to me as an invitation — only as a warning created from the wounds of a memory. The film is a clear love letter to Elliot Miller and the other men in Mendoza’s unit, but the verisimilitude with which it recreates the worst day of their lives — when measured against the ambiguity as to what it hopes to achieve by doing so — ultimately makes “Warfare” seem like a natural evolution of Garland’s previous work, so much of which has hinged on the belief that our history as a species (and, more recently, America’s self-image as a country) is shaped by the limits of our imagination. 

[San Francisco Chronicle](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/402) \- [G. Allen Johnson](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/g-allen-johnson) \- 4/4

>Garland has become this generation’s Oliver Stone, a studio filmmaker who is able to fearlessly capture the zeitgeist on hot-button issues few other Hollywood filmmakers touch, such as AI (2015’s “Ex Machina”), the political divide and a society’s slide toward violence (“Civil War”), and now the consequences of military diplomacy.

[Empire Magazine](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/148) \- [Alex Godfrey](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/alex-godfrey) \- 5/5

>War is hell, and Warfare refuses to shy away from it. Free of the operatics of most supposed anti-war films, it’s all the more effective for its simplicity. It is respectfully gruelling.

[The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/213) \- [David Rooney](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/david-rooney)

>Garland is working in peak form and with dazzling technical command in what’s arguably his best film since his debut, *Ex Machina*. But the director’s skill with the compressed narrative would be nothing without the rigorous sense of authenticity and first-hand tactical knowledge that Mendoza brings to the material — and no doubt to the commitment of the actors.

[AV Club](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/833) \- [Brianna Zigler](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/brianna-zigler) \- B+

>Simply depicting the plain, ugly truth of human combat makes *Warfare* all the more effective as a piece of art setting out to evoke a time and place. The bombing set piece is equal parts horrific and thrilling; the filmmakers draw out the sensory reality of the slaughter as the men slowly come to, disoriented, ears ringing, ultimately leading to a frenzy of confusion, agita, and howling agony. The cacophony of torment and its reaction in the men meant to arrive with help is as grim as the bureaucratic resistance to send in medic vehicles to give the wounded any chance to survive their injuries.

[Independent (UK)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/691) \- [Clarisse Loughrey](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/clarisse-loughrey) \- 3/5

>Alex Garland has now constructed what could be called his trilogy of violence... Warfare, at least, is the most successful of the three, because its myopia is a crucial part of its structure. Garland and Mendoza do, at least in this instance, make careful, considerate use of the film’s framework. We’re shown how US soldiers invade the home of an Iraqi family who, for the rest of *Warfare*’s duration, are held hostage in a downstairs bedroom, guns routinely thrust into their faces. In its final scene, they reemerge into the rubble of what was once their home, their lives upended by US forces and then abandoned without a second thought. It’s quite the metaphor.

[Daily Telegraph (UK)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/921) \- [Robbie Collin](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/robbie-collin) \- 5/5

>It’s necessarily less sweeping than Garland’s recent Civil War, and for all its fire and fury plays as something of a philosophical B-side to that bigger earlier film. I’d certainly be uncomfortable calling it an action movie, even though vast tracts of it are nothing but. It leaves questions ringing in your ears as well as gunfire.

[Guardian](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/205) \- [Peter Bradshaw](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/peter-bradshaw) \- 3/5

>In some ways, Warfare is like the rash of war-on-terror pictures that appeared 20 years ago, such as Kathryn Bigelow’s The Hurt Locker or Nick Broomfield’s Battle for Haditha, or indeed Brian De Palma’s interesting, underrated film Redacted. But Warfare doesn’t have the anti-war reflex and is almost fierce in its indifference to political or historical context, the resource that should be more readily available two decades on. The movie is its own show of force in some ways, surely accurate in showing what the soldiers did, moment by moment, though blandly unaware of a point or a meaning beyond the horror.

[Times (UK)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/823) \- [Kevin Maher](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/kevin-maher) \- 5/5

>This is a movie that’s as difficult to watch as it is to forget. It’s a sensory blitz, a percussive nightmare and a relentless assault on the soul.

[Deadline](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2256) \- [Gregory Nussen](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/gregory-nussen)

>While it aims for an unromantic portrait of combat, it can only conceive of doing so through haptic recreation in lieu of actual characterization. The result is a cacophonous temper tantrum, a vacuous and perfidious advertisement for military recruitment.

[London Evening Standard](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/446) \- [Martin Robinson](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/martin-robinson) \- 4/5

>Given all the America First stuff going on, and the history of the Iraq War, Warfare may suffer from a lack of sympathy for American military operations. And yet, the sheer technical brilliance and strength of performances, cannot fail to connect when you take on the film on its own terms, as pure human experience in the most hellish of circumstances.",1176,0.93,716,2025-03-28 13:45:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jlvfq8/a24s_warfare_review_thread/,ChiefLeef22

movies,1k28pw0,Jesse Plemons is easily one of the best actors working today,"I just finished watching Black Mirror (I know I know it is a tv show but hear me out) and Jesse Plemons reminded me once again how much of a scene stealer he is. He is an amazing character actor who embodies his roles so well. I think what he does best is micro-expressions and the way he acts is just so natural in a given situation.

I love him in Game Night. That role can just be a run of the mill nosy and annoying neighbor but he made it quite charming and so funny. 

Anyway, what is your favorite role of his? Some choices to pick from:

Breaking Bad

USS Callister

Power of the Dog

Kinda of Kindness

The Irishman

Killers of the Flower Moon

Fargo

Judas and the Black Messiah

Civil War 

Game Night

Zero Day

movies,1k37f8i,Does it bother people when time limits given in movies are not followed?,"I've just watched San Andreas, which is a fun but unsurprisingly unrealistic movie, but one thing that's stood out to me as particularly immersion breaking is the use of time. It's just arbitrary.

For example, at the start of the film there's a scene where a rescue helicopter is running low on fuel whilst hovering during a rescue.

The Rock (I don't even think the character has a name, it's always just The Rock playing himself) says ""we have 5 minutes!"". 

About 15 minutes later and the helicopter is still going. And then they finally rescue the girl and fly back to base, the lack of fuel completely ignored for the rest of the flight.

The scene already had plenty of jeopardy, why add low fuel as well if it's going to be ignored immediately?! 

And then later, The Rock is saving his daughter from drowning whilst appearing to hold his breath for 30mins all while doing intense physical exertion. 

Bonus points for him watching her drown before deciding to try kicking the blockage to free her...

Do these silly time related discrepancies annoy anyone else more than they should? 

Is there a name for this?

Incredible film, acting and music. The pacing is great, and keeps your adrenaline up. The way they explained technical terms and concepts was great for someone that has basic knowledge of the stock market. I did have to go back a few times to rewatch some parts. 

Not being an American citizen, it was shocking to see the reality of what a mess the banks made of the mortgage market. My face must’ve looked more shocked than Steve Carell’s character throughout the movie. The greed and apathy of the top guys is incredible. I especially liked the Mr. Chau character (who is a real person). And the gotcha at the end when they revealed only 1 person got a prison sentence out of this shit show. 

The parallels with what’s going on right now is quite freaky. My favourite part was how they blamed immigrants and the poor. They’re still blaming immigrants and the poor.
