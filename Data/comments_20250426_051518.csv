The whole area around Kelowna is really nice. You could also go to Penticton (south of Kelowna) or some of the small towns very close to Penticton like Naramata. Lots of wineries around there if that's your thing.

If you have a way to add maybe 2 more days to your ring road trip I would do so. Skipping the westfjords is likely necessary due to time even with a couple extra days. 

No issues with the sparse populations other than being aware that hotel rooms can be limited so book well in advance especially on the south coast area (Vík, Höfn) which is most popular for tourists if you want to stay right in town and at a more reasonable/affordable price. Also restaurants outside of Reykjavik may close a bit earlier than in larger population places so be sure to allow time to get dinner in the evening before restaurants close (if you are doing restaurants rather than grocery shopping)",2025-03-30 17:59:42,2,saras415,travel
mkjytix,1jmp1tg,reddit,"I visited Lofoten Norway last summer and loved it! A few tips/ideas for your trip:

1) You likely know this, but just to be sure, you are planning A LOT of driving, particularly in Lofoten. The weather there seems to change about every 15 minutes and in October, there is a chance of snow which can make driving more difficult. Normally, the weather can get very windy as well. Just want to caution that driving there seemed to take longer than Google maps advertised depending on weather and traffic. 

2) Transportation - If you fly to Bodø first and then take a ferry, the main ferry for your itinerary is [Torghatten](https://www.torghatten.no/en/our-routes/18-782?tab=info). Route A goes from Bodø to Moskenes. You can check the schedules online. 

3) Hikes in Lofoten - Read about the hikes in advance and you might want to have a few different ones on your itinerary. You likely know this already too, but just to be sure, the hiking in Lofoten is difficult and we found the local descriptions of difficulty to be underrated. For context and not to brag, we are a very active mid 30s adults who regularly run/bike/lift and run sub 3 hour marathons. The ""Moderate/Medium"" hikes were pretty hard, think climbing 2,000 ft elevation in 1 mile with no stairs. We didn't get as far down in Reine since we were mainly in northern Lofoten and Vesteralen, but Reinebringen hike is one of the ones you see online the most but can be very busy (maybe not in Oct) and dangerous depending on your ability (check out news stories on deaths there). I would consider checking out Munken hike in Sørvågen near Reine, supposed to be less busy and better views. Near Henningsvaer, check out Mannen hike which we did. It's not too long and has gorgeous views of Haukland Beach. Also, beware of hiking on rainy days or right after it's rained -- the trails can get very muddy and slippery. 

Those are my tips, hope you enjoy the trip and happy to answer any questions!",2025-03-30 18:03:25,2,gk615,travel

Some tavernas will charge you an amount for the cooking (relatively low), some will do it for free as long as you order enough of their food. You just ask them.

mkbl458,1jmgk5r,reddit,"On the cheaper end of the accommodation spectrum, you should expect to spend about S$80-100 for one night in Singapore (about 4,000 pesos). Food varies considerably; expect to pay about $10 per meal - more if you get drinks or eat in a restaurant, less if you have a small appetite in a hawker centre or coffee shop.

Transport from the airport to the city: $30 by taxi, or about $2.50 by train/bus. One day of public transit will probably cost no more than $10-12 unless you decide to take taxis or Grab. You can use your foreign Visa or Mastercard debit or credit card; there is a small service fee, but it will be cheaper than buying an EZ-Link card.

Cost of activities is going to depend tremendously. Zoo? Mahal na. But some of the public libraries are very Instagrammable and free to enter. The Singapore City Gallery (near Maxwell Food Centre and Chinatown) is also free entry and worth checking out. Even Gardens By the Bay has a reasonably large free outdoor area - if you are on a budget, don't bother forking out (about $70) for the air-conditioned Flower Dome gardens.

mjz30we,1jkriru,reddit,"Interesting post.

I did an overland and sea trip from Australia to Italy, without taking any flights.That took me about 2 years.

My advice would be... leave everything as open and unbooked as possible.Allow yourself time, things always go much slower than you expect.

Also give yourself plenty of time when you are NOT moving.Traveling every day or two gets tiring very quickly.

Then, have more money than you think you will need.Things go wrong from time to time, and sometimes you want to spend more than a minimal budget..no point missing interesting things because you don't have the money to see them.

As Kananaskis mentioned, there are some problematic areas here for sure.I did my trip almost entirely by public transport so can't help you much on the regulations for private vehicles, but it's not easy in some cases.

The hardest thing for me was getting a lift on a private boat (in my case Australia to Indonesia)... that took a lot of waiting, asking around and eventually a lot of luck.

I’m a big history buff and my favorite stops was Ephesus and Pamukkale (not the baths themselves but the ancient city around them). Both fantastic if you like history. 

Istanbul was alright, a bit too big for my taste but the old town is worth doing, Hagia Sophia and the blue mosque are definitely worth a visit, but go in the morning.

It’s dark and rainy and I just arrived here in Cppaadocia, so I can’t speak for it yet, but it’s clear that this has become quite a touristy place. But so have the entire country, we can’t complain because we see apart of that ofc. Still, I can already tell that’s it’s an incredible place, so I would go here too if culture is your main objective. 

I created the following plan, which I followed, more or less, by car: https://turkeyroadtrip.netlify.app/turkey-2025-road-trip.html",2025-04-24 20:54:31,2,Viap01010000,travel
mov7ll3,1k724px,reddit,"Turk here,

8-9 days is not a lot, I think you should drop Antalya if you are not going to the beach.

I would do 4 days in Istanbul and 4 days in Cappadocia.
You can fly between the two.

If you are adamant about seeing one more place, make it somewhere close to either Istanbul or Cappadocia. Below are some cities with enough historical sights to keep you occupied for a day.

Bursa: Close to Istanbul, could be a day trip

Kayseri: You could fly in or out of here when visiting Cappadocia. 

Ankara: Close to Cappadocia, but likely have to rent a car at the airport and drive. Super underrated city imo (but only worth 2 days max)

Another idea might be:

D1: Fly to Ankara, rent a car, check out the castle and the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations

D2: Check out Anitkabir in the morning (go inside the museum to learn about the modern history of Turkey), drive to the Lake Tuz to see the pink salt flats (and some flamingos if youre lucky), make your way to the city of Aksaray to spend the night

D3: Check out Ihlara Valley (a beautiful and historic canyon), the Greek  ghost town of Güzelyurt, & the fairy chimneys of Selime, before driving to your hotel in Kapadokya.

You need minimum 3 full days in Kapadokya. A car will your life much easier

Don't miss: Paşabağ, Zelve, Uçhisar, Ortahisar, Aşk Vadisi, Göreme, Ürgüp, Avanos.
(Paşabağ and Zelve are my favorites)

Finally you will need to drive all the way back to Ankara (3-4h) to drop of the car and catch your flight to Istanbul. There are much closer airports in Nevşehir and Kayseri, but I highly doubt the car rental company would let you drop off the car in some other city. Maybe its worth to email and ask anyway.

mo6znx7,1k3yuo1,reddit,"The full Inca trail takes 4 days/3 nights to hike, and you’re hiking in the backcountry for the entire duration. There are only a few places where you can actually join the trail, and logistically a 3 day/2 night trek does not make any sense. So the shorter option (2D/1N) is basically joining the trail near Aguas Calientes, hiking for 5-6 hours along the tail end of the trail, then either camping or going back down into town to stay at a hotel. Then the next morning you take a bus up to Machu Picchu and explore that. So it really just depends on how much hiking you want to do and how much of your trip you want to devote to that versus doing other things in the area. In either case, you’ll take the train at least from Aguas Calientes to Ollantaytambo (it’s the only way to get between them). 

I would say that only two days in Cusco (plus the Sacred Valley, which is at a lower altitude) is only barely enough time to acclimatize if you plan to do the full 4 day trek. It’s probably fine if you just do the shorter option.

If the former, there are “two-day hikes” to MP. Basically, the train takes you like 90% of the way to Aguas Calientes, you get off the train at like km 104, and you hike the rest of the way with your guide. This needs to be planned because you literally just get off the train in the middle of nowhere.  

If the latter, I don’t recall that there were hikes in Ollantaytambo. There are “hikes” as part of some circuits at MP.

As for some of your requests for recommendations:

-Hotel in Cusco:  we stayed at Casa Clara. It’s a new-ish boutique hotel by Annanay Hotels near the Belmont and Inkaterra.  If you’re into walking, it’s just about at the start of the road leading to Sacsaywaman.  We really liked this hotel because it was smaller and the staff was so welcoming.  And it was right next door to the art museum which was open late. 

-Hotel in Ollantaytambo:  we stayed at El Albergue at the train station.  It was pretty cool just needing to walk outside to catch the train. And they watch your luggage while you are at MP.

-Tour Companies:  we went with cuscolocalfriend.com for most things.  They were really great to work with (but, admittedly, maybe a little slow with emails while we were trying to schedule things).

mou1jle,1k3yuo1,reddit,"Personally, I would switch a couple of things around. I would aim to properly acclimatize in Cusco and hit the trails soon after, if hiking is your goal (allow at least 3 days of acclimatization). The way I would structure it is the following:  
  
Day 1: Lima  
Days 2-4: Cusco  
Days 5-7: Trek to Machu Picchu (I did the [Salkantay Trek](https://overalltraveller.com/salkantay-trek-to-machu-picchu/) but I imagine you might want to do the Inca trail as it's a bit shorter)  
Day 8: head to Ollantaytambo (or back to Cusco) and do the organized Sacred Valley tour. It doesn't involve a lot of walking, so you can rest your legs after the multi-day trek  
Day 9: Rainbow Mountain (this is at high elevation!)  
Day 10: Cusco  
Day 11: Lima 

If you do the Salkantay Trek, you also see Humantay Lake on the way.   
  
I would say that if you want to allow more relaxation during your trip, you should skip the Inca/Salkantay trek to Machu Picchu. Instead you can do the hike from Aguas Calientes to Machu Picchu or one of the many hikes at the top (Machu Picchu mountain is a grinder but has amazing views).",2025-04-24 18:31:59,1,Theoveralltraveller,travel

mo9ao9e,1k3y633,reddit,"Hi OP!

The four day Inca Trail was one of the best experiences of my life; I'd say that the trail is almost a greater 'destination' than Machu Picchu itself.

The two day 'Inca Trail' is an access track installed by the Peruvian government which effectively skips the Trail that was built by the Inca.

My two cents are you should either walk the four day trail or just take the train directly to Machu Picchu.

Seattle: take a ferry over to Bainbridge Island (walk on), check out the Bloedel Reserve, eat at Ba Sa (seriously, you must do this).  Enjoy Eagle Harbor books, get a snack at Blackbird Bakery.

If you want to continue on, you could rent a car and explore Hurricane Ridge [Hoh Rain Forest Area Brochure - Olympic National Park (U.S. National Park Service)](https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/hoh-rain-forest-area-brochure.htm) (currently open, check status before driving up there and if you do go, get your park pass in advance). Absolutely amazing views and stunning scenery.

In Seattle itself, there's a ton to do. Olympic Sculpture Park, newly completed waterfront ([Seattle Waterfront - Food, Fun & Attractions on 20 Piers](https://seattlewaterfront.org/)). If you have good weather, you'll see Mt Tahoma (Rainier).  If you happen to have a car, you could do Chuckanut Drive (what a name, but seriously gorgeous: [Chuckanut Drive Scenic Byway](https://www.scenicwa.com/chuckanut-drive)).

If you go to Portland, you could take Amtrak or bus it, but once you get to Portland, park your car in any SmartPark garage ([SmartPark Garages | Portland.gov](https://www.portland.gov/transportation/parking/smartpark)) and use MAX, which can take you all over. Check out the International Rose Gardens, the gorgeous Japanese Gardens, great views of Mt. Hood. Portland still has a strong food truck scene ([Food Cart Pods | The Official Guide to Portland](https://www.travelportland.com/food-carts/pods/)). If you love books, a lot at least 1-2 hours for Powells City of Books (new and used, [The World's Largest Independent Bookstore | Powell's Books](https://www.powells.com/)). There is no shortage of fantastic food in Portland, but for reliably good and affordable fare, seek out [Pubs, Breweries and Historic Hotels in Oregon and Washington - McMenamins](https://www.mcmenamins.com/), which also has inns and hotels. If you want to venture further west, check out McMinnville with wineries and the Evergreen Aviation Museum. If you want to head east, you can drive the gorgeous Columbia Gorge ([Mt. Hood & The Columbia River Gorge | Things to See & Do](https://traveloregon.com/places-to-go/regions/mt-hood-columbia-river-gorge/?utm_actcampaign=521178873&msclkid=b3a26122b16912c0302f09201759da1c&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=**LP%20-%20Tier%205&utm_term=Columbia%20River%20Gorge%20Travel&utm_content=Columbia%20River%20Gorge%20Travel)) which has some lovely waterfalls and hiking.

So, you know, take it with a couple grains of salt, but I think your stipulations and preferences are a perfect fit for Seattle and Portland. Both have great parks that are fun and scenic but not super strenuous, both have wonderful neighborhoods to explore on foot, Seattle has Cap Hill, Ballard, Fremont, and Green Lake, and Portland has Alberta, Belmont, and Hawthorne. There are great hoods beyond these, but those are profoundly walkable. And both cities are easily reachable without a car from one to the other (bus or train, and obvy flights), and both are gorgeous in May. You will have some variance in weather, for the PNW be a cruel mistress, but chances are you'll get a good pavement pounding vibe. 


I can't speak to your tours interest as well. But both cities are fantastic to walk around. Seattle has an amazing underground tour, seeing the ""old"" city (it's a long story), that people rave about. But again, I have no direct experience there.

... Honestly,  since you don't drive, I wouldn't recommend splitting between Seattle & Portland for just a week's travel. You'll lose almost a full day for it.   Depending on what day of the week/month that you're travelling, it could take 4-7 hours to get from one place to another. Amtrak is not predictable,  nor are buses. 

Instead, you could split between Seattle and the Olympic Penninsula by ferry to Bremerton / Bainbridge Island or travel up to the San Juans by boat. You could take the Clipper up to Victoria BC, which is well set up for the non-driver between day tours & public transportation.   It's gorgeous up there. 

Look into an ORCA card for public transportation.  There's a route called *Mountains to the Sound* and other locations where you can get off the beaten path.  City parks have some amazing views too.

Here are some tips from a Amsterdam local :)
-Tram and foot is the best option for you , wouldn’t really recommend a bike if you don’t really have any experience. It can be quite dangerous if you bike without any experience so its safer to just take the tram or walk.
- Anne-Frank house is quite touristy but its worth to visit( better to go early and on weekdays)
- Don’t go to Fabel friet (sorry) its overrated and so crowded. Never heard anyone from Amsterdam saying that they go to Fabel. If you definitely want to go, don’t visit the one in the Runstraat cuz its SO busy. Visit the one on Nieuwendijk or Oude Hoogstraat instead. Much more quiet and also have seats available.

In general I would’ve advised to plan more days for Paris….

With this itinerary you’re giving yourself the chance to visit some really nice places in the countryside surround the cities you’re visiting. 

The Alsace region south of Strasbourg is very pretty and pleasant. Perhaps consider renting a car and exploring several towns in addition to Colmar.  

Likewise for Nice. So many options. 

And Lyon also has many possibilities. You could even go the Alps for one night. Depending on how relaxed/intensive you would want to make your days. As it is not stressful or rushed at all. 

For Amsterdam, my advice would be to skip the places you found on TikTok or instagram and wander around. Maybe visit some cafes and restaurants locals go to.

   * Try visiting Rhine fall if time permits
2. 5/31 Lauterbrunnen

I had long heard about the legendary Chongqing hotpot, so I found a small local restaurant near Jiefangbei that came highly recommended. The moment the bright red broth hit the table, the aroma of chili and Sichuan peppercorns wrapped around me. The steam curled up into the air, and even the atmosphere seemed to carry that spicy, numbing scent.

Tripe, duck intestines, and sliced beef went into the pot one after another. Every bite was intensely flavorful — spicy, numbing, and absolutely addictive. My eyes were watering from the heat, but I couldn’t stop eating. That was when I truly understood what people meant by “painfully delicious.”

After the feast, I hailed a taxi back to the hotel, only to discover that the real “main event” of the night was just beginning. The taxi driver weaved through the overpasses like he was drifting in a racing game. The car shot up, dove down, twisted left and right — my GPS couldn’t even keep up. The roads in Chongqing are a mystery, like a rollercoaster built into the city. For a moment, I honestly wondered if the driver was moonlighting as a racecar driver. I gripped the door handle tightly, half-laughing and half-nervous the entire ride. It was thrilling and hilarious — an experience that could only happen in Chongqing.

Carry your wallet in a front pocket, some cash in the other pocket, passport in a zipper pocket.  Think about getting the pants in a shorter inseam, so they don’t drag and wick water.

Have two breast pockets, either Velcro, zipper or button, or a mix.  Great for planes and buses as can keep passport there, phone, earbuds, just easy to reach while sitting.  Best place to but then is Academy Sports a Texas store but have mail order.  They are made for ht weather and dry quickly, very airy.

Clyde's drive in across the bridge from Mackinaw is a good food stop if you enter/exit the UP from that direction. Definitely stop for pasties somewhere, we did Jean Kay's pasties in Marquette and Roy's pasties in Houghton. Stop at Jampot if you head up towards Copper Harbor - absolutely delicious baked goods and preserves made by monks, it's a very unique destination.

There's lots of great hiking. In Marquette we hiked Hogback mountain and visited Presque Isle Park. In Copper Harbor you can drive the Brockway mountain drive and get a great view of the lakes from the top. 

Visit some of the mines if you can. Delaware copper mine  near Eagle Harbor is cool, it's a self guided tour that takes you all the way down into an old copper mine that is partially flooded. Lots of steps down and back up though. Quincy Mine north of Houghton is a good stop if you head north from there, it's more of a museum and very informative.

My main purpose for this road trip was rock hounding, there are plenty of pebble beach locations across the UP where you can find agates and other cool rocks.

mmupz3k,1jxon4q,reddit,"100% skip Four Corners if you have to detour to any appreciable extent for it. It is one of the most commonly-cited tourist traps in the country.

I think the biggest challenge for your itinerary in October/November is that you will have to go around the Sierras to get to Yosemite. If you do you should visit Joshua Tree and Death Valley along the way. Maybe Los Angeles and San Diego too. I would recommend doing both Sequoia NP and Yosemite but I can see the argument for skipping Sequoia... but you can still kinda like drive through it if nothing else, it isn't a huge detour from Yosemite.

I personally would choose ""west"" or ""east"" of Vegas - if you choose ""west"", do stuff in SoCal for all the rest of your time. If ""east"", then go to Grand Canyon, Zion, and whatever other parks in the four corners states. You won't be able to do both unless you skip a lot of very beautiful places that will be near some of your stops.",2025-04-13 05:35:28,2,mtg_liebestod,travel

mmrpldo,1jxmc62,reddit,"California is an incredible place with so much to see. In my opinion, the best way to experience the state is by car as there’s such a wide variety of natural beauty that you can't really experience unless you drive (or take a bus tour). As the other poster mentioned, doing a trip with others would save on gas, rental car and accomodation. If you're outdoorsy, camping at the national parks would be cheaper than hotels.

Given the current geopolitical climate, many foreigners aren't travelling to the U.S., and there are growing concerns about increased border security and the possibility of tourists being detained. Whether those concerns are justified or not, it’s something worth keeping in mind as you plan your trip. Canadians have to start registering with the U.S. government if they'll be in the country longer than 30 days, not sure if it's the same for Europeans.",2025-04-12 18:02:18,1,jyeatbvg,travel
mms8k1v,1jxmc62,reddit,"Some general pieces of advice, beyond hitting up the major urban attractions:

- In terms of nature definitely check out Yosemite, Death Valley, Joshua Tree, Sequoia, and Coastal Redwoods NPs. My favorite ""hidden gem"" is Fern Canyon near Coastal Redwoods NPs. It's not California but consider adding Crater Lake as well if you're traveling far north. The other NPs are nice but missable (although the foxes at Channel Islands NP are adorable.) Some of these places will vary significantly though depending on season, I would try to hit them in Spring/Fall.

- If you plan on going east of the Sierras (Joshua Tree NP and Death Valley NP) consider adding Las Vegas to your itinerary. Although once you do that, you can also consider adding the Hoover Dam and Grand Canyon too.... gotta cut things somewhere I guess.

- I recommend doing as much of the PCH as you can. Consider doing a big road trip loop from say San Diego -> Las Vegas -> Death Valley -> Crater Lake -> Eureka -> PCH all the way down to San Diego, covering LA and SF too. Skip the central valley except insofar as you need to in order to visit Yosemite and Sequoia NP.

- I personally think Salvation Mountain / East Jesus is a really neat destination as well, near Joshua Tree.

- It definitely would be better to share the experience with others.",2025-04-12 19:46:41,1,mtg_liebestod,travel
mn6oais,1jxmc62,reddit,"I'm sure there's group trips available but renting a car is probably your best bet. You'll have maximum flexibility that way and be able to get around cities and to the National Parks and beaches. 

A good itinerary would be to fly into LA or San Diego, then head north to San Francisco checking out parks like Joshua Tree, Death Valley, Sequoia, and Yosemite along the way. Yosemite is spectacular and very popular - reserve campsites well in advance. Redwood NP is also beautiful but quite a bit further north. 

Big Sur has stunning coastline along iconic Highway 1. It's not a national park but you can visit state parks like Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park and Andrew Molera State Park. Pfeiffer beach has purple sand and you can see coastal redwoods in this area. 

Please take care to have your travel documents in order at the airport. America has sadly been going through unpredictable and disorganized immigration crackdowns. That said, there's been a notable drop in travel here so you may be able to find good deals on hotels and airfare. 

One of my favorite trips ever was a 12 day roadtrip through San Francisco, Yosemite, Sequoia, and Big Sur. There are so many outstandingly beautiful places to see in California, it's easy to get overwhelmed. Pick a few key cities and nature spots and then plan your trip around those.

At that time Playa del Carmen was the most beautiful place on the coast, but now it's so overrun with tourists, I think you're wise to skip it.

Chichen Itza is stunning, large, and crowded. Get there early and ignore the souvenir guys with the jaguar whistles. I wouldn't count on visiting additional ruins, since you'll probably be tired.

We stayed in kasane around july 2008 and did a game drive and a river boat trip.  Both were good but the river boat was more fun.  The early game drive was absolutely freezing.

We then went to maun and organised a scenic flight, which was hot but could see hundreds of animals.  We then did a 3 day canoe camp trip from maun.  That was the most fun, camping in the delta - albeit only on the edges of it because the boat trips don’t go very far in.  Saw plenty of animals and the delta was rising.  It was great being just us, 2 guides and another couple on the island.  We did walking trips looking for game and poled around in the canoe.  We heard elephants chomping in the night nearby but didn’t actually see any - were weren’t bothered because we’d already seen heaps in other places. 

We were told by locals that the further into the delta you go the better it is, but all of those fly in/fly out camps were very expensive and we were travelling on a very tight budget.

One of the highlights was on the bus from kasane to maun - it stopped in the middle of the highway because a leopard was siting by the side of the road.

Allocate 3 nights to Porto, with one day trip to Aveiro. There’s a train from Porto that’ll get you there in 2 hours or less and Aveiro really doesn’t have that much to do that you need more than a day there. 

Spend the next 3 nights in Lisbon. But on the day that you go to Lisbon, take an early Flixbus to Obidos, explore as a day trip, then continue on to Lisbon. 

Once you’re in Lisbon, take a day trip that includes both Sintra and Cascais. Explore castles in Sintra during the day then head to Cascais in the later afternoon for a bit of exploring and have dinner there then go home.

Principe Real’s biggest issue is that a lot of it is not convenient to the metro so you have to walk to the metro or take the bus, both of which add a lot of time and Lisboa is somewhat hilly so walking isn’t always a ton of fun. If you’re staying along the northern or eastern edge of the neighborhood near a metro stop it’s workable. 

Chiado would be much more convenient to tourist sites and the metro.

Heidelberg, Strasbourg, Colmar, and the Route des Vins villages are some of the best preserved German architecture in the world. Honestly much more so than places like Munich, Nürnberg, or Würzburg (not that their architecture is anything bad). It will also be a nice cultural contrast to see Germany (BaWü) and then Alsace for a bit of French flair thrown in to spice up the trip. 

For places to visit outside of the aforementioned here are my recommendations:

• Alsace: Riquewihr, Kaysersberg-Vignoble, Ribeauvillé, Eguisheim, Barr, Turckheim, Bergheim

The hotel is within the park and allows you to access the falls outside of park hours, so you can see it without anyone else around you. It really was worth the price and the trouble of getting there. The hotel itself is a stunning historic building and has a nice pool. The rooms are a little smaller since it's an older building, but they are well maintained and comfortable. But again, the real selling point is the off hours access to the park. 

On the Argentine side, the Gran Melia looked nice, but it doesn't have park access, and was really expensive. We opted for the LOI, which was significantly cheaper than the Gran Melia but was still very nice. Your kids would love the pools. We were able to hire a private driver who picked us up at the hotel, took us to the Argentine side of the park in the morning, and drove us to the Belmond after the park. The Argentine side of the falls was really beautiful too, and if you get there right as the park is opening, you can see parts of it without many other people around. 

Happy to answer any questions you have! Enjoy BA!",2025-04-07 15:44:13,5,americanatletour,travel
mlvyo8n,1jtndbo,reddit,"Yes, it was one of the most impressive things I've ever seen. Stay for two days and do both the Brazilian and Argentinian side. There's a lot of hotels in either Puerto Iguazu and Foz do Iguazu, and cabs from the cities to the falls aren't too expensive. Though if you don't get the Brazilian Visa it's still worth it to do just the Argentinian side. 

  
The Argentinian side is large and there's a lot of lookouts for different levels of waterfalls, and you get to go right up to the devils throat and see how hard and fast the water falls. There's a lot of coatis that are really cute and will try to steal your food, and a little train that takes you up and down the lookouts. The Brazilian side is smaller and requires a bus ride from the parking lot, but it has a more all encompassing view, and I saw a wild capybara and her babies near the falls. and there's a bird sanctuary near the entrance that's worth it to check out too.",2025-04-07 16:37:13,2,Jino_bino_3057,travel

So you switched hotels on the other side? Is that needed? If we went, I think we were thinking of just doing 2 nights and sticking to one. Could we fly into the Argentina side and still stay at belmond? I will check out LOI",2025-04-07 16:39:09,1,technoguy06,travel
mlw00rz,1jtndbo,reddit,"We stayed at the Belmond and it was fantastic. With little kids, I think it would be perfect. You can walk from your room to the falls/park trails and as a hotel guest, you can access the area after the park closes and before it officially opens. Experiencing it without crowds is amazing and unforgettable! 

The Belmond has great food, too. Service was impeccable from start to finish (it also helped that we got a room upgrade as we were there midweek in the off-peak season).

I don't think the Gran Melia is worth the price because it doesn't come with park access.",2025-04-07 16:44:14,1,wannabejetsetter,travel

mlx57ej,1jtndbo,reddit,"We were in BA this past December and spend 2 nights 3 days in Iguazu Falls, and stayed the 2 nights at the Gran Melia.  That hotel is fabulous,  I am sure the Belmond is also nice,  but I would not hesitate to stay at the Gran Melia again.  Not sure where the other posters are getting that the Gran Melia does not have direct access to the park,  literally walk out from the swimming pool area, and the park is right there.  You do have to pay a park fee, but that fee covers your entrance to the Argentina side, and one fee is good for all days of your hotel stay.

I think I posted a brief trip review of our stay in this sub months ago, so you can search on it.  But 2 nights is a perfect amount of time.  Also, if you can time your visit to during a full moon,  on the Argentina side,  you can do the Full Moon walk out to the Devil's Throat trail on the 5 nights around the full moon.  This was an incredible experience.

Our schedule at the Gran Melia was as follows:

Day 1:  Flew from BA to IGR early morning,  got into the hotel around 1pm,  we walked one of the trails (lower level).   In the evening,  we did the Full Moon walk out to the Devil's Throat

DAy 2:  Hired a private driver to take us to the Brazil side of the falls.  Left our hotel around 9am.  The Brazil trail took about 2 hours to finish, then we did the powerboat ride and the bird park.  Got back to the hotel around 5pm

Day 3:  We checked out of the hotel, and left our luggage with the frontdesk.  At around 10am we started the rest of the trails on the Argentina side (Upper and Devil's throat).  We finished around 2pm.   Went back to the Gran Melia, and spent time at the pool and ordered lunch at the pool.  Relaxed around the pool till around 5ish, then went to the spa/gym to shower and freshen up before heading to the airport for our return flight at 7:30pm to BA.

I really like Gran Melia allowing the guests to spent the day at the pool, and using the shower facilities with lockers at the spa.  Good to freshen up after a long day of hiking the park and extra pool time.  The infinity pool is just amazing, and the view from the pool of the Falls is worth every penny.

  
Would totally recommend to stay at a hotel that is inside the park, if your budget can support it.  The convenience is just so much better and the time savings is worth it.

Oh another thing to look into is the hotel/airBNB in BA, if  it may be same or not much more to book it for then he week, versus the 4 nights.  A lot of times the weekly rental  is not much more,  then you can just leave most of your stuff in BA and pack some small things for IGR.
We did that with the BA Marriott, I was using reward points to book, and a 5 night stay was 90k points, for a 3 night stay that we were actually in BA would’ve been 65k Marriott points,  made sense for us to do the 5 nights for 25k more.",2025-04-07 20:13:54,1,YYZ_Flyer,travel

Even with the lack of jet lag, it just wasn’t quite worth it to us to add the extra traveling…mainly because travel is tougher with kids, as you know. So while the falls sound amazing, you’re proposing even less nights there and with an additional child than we dealt with, so it would give me hesitation.

I didn't stay in one of the two hotels you mentioned because the cost was not something I was willing to pay. But it's full of really cool hotel. I chose one that was very very nice and near the center of Puerto Iguazu so I could walk into the center at night and have a drink and eat.

If you are in Munich prior to Christmas, you will be able to hit the Christmas markets, and there is a good chance for snow. Same for Salzburg, as it is more in the mountians. 

But one thing to know, Munich and most of Germany close down midday on Christmas eve, and I mean close down. The markets end, and will not open again, as the Christmas season is over.  But come midday Christmas day the resturants ect start to reopen. 

Same for Salzburg. Salzburg is really really nice around Christmas, and we liked it better than Munich. We wish we had spent more time there. We did a day trip on Christmas Eve from Munich, given that Munich would be shut down. 

We then took the train from Munich to Paris on Christmas day, which was a delight. And then got to experience Paris all lit up for Christmas. 

  
You will be hit or miss with snow no matter where you go. Munich had half a foot the week before we went, and it did snow when we were there. In Salzburg, it snowed on Christmas Eve, and the mountains got feet of snow.

mlf0mh8,1jren9d,reddit,"My two cents.. 


Are you planning to many places? Maybe. Personally, I would skip a few. Ibiza is the first one to come to mind - yes it's good for partying, but that's also easy to find in cities like Paris or Barcelona! Best tip is to just ask the locals where the best night life is. And if you want to go a place just for partying I would honestly choose Berlin over Ibiza any day. Both with regards to quality and price.


Another thing to consider would be adding some smaller/less known cities. A lot of your destinations are extremely crowded during the summer months, and you might get tired of always being in a queue. One example could be going to Bologna/Padua instead of Florence. Valencia instead of Barcelona. Etc.


For food: The Michelin Guide app is great, it also includes restaurants that don't have stars, but are good bargains. It has found us many great restaurants at a reasonable price.


Another tip: Don't book everything before you go. You will always find hotels to stay at, and the price difference is not that bad. You could even find some amazing offers. For romance: personally, nothing beats staying an extra night at a place you enjoy. Or going some place you get recommended.

ml324zj,1jpuwim,reddit,"I gotchu! My relatives live in Provence and I've had the privilege of spending much time there. I would pick Provence by a landslide to the Côte d'Azur given your interests (not biased at all haha). The historic towns/villages and food/wine culture are significantly better imo in Provence. Don't worry too much about it being too sleepy, you can always base yourself in a bigger town like Aix, Avignon, or even Arles. I would personally stay in a nice historic village but with enough restaurant options as a home base like Fontaine de Vaucluse or L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue, but that's just me.

For villages to see in Provence check this out:  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les\_Plus\_Beaux\_Villages\_de\_France#Provence-Alpes-C%C3%B4te\_d'Azur) It's a list of the most beautiful villages awarded by the French government. Focus on the 'Vaucluse' section.

One last mention. Given your interests, don't rule out other regions of France. Especially the Dordogne, Alsace, or Burgundy. They can be equally if not more charming than Provence and a whole lot less touristy. Also I think the wine scene is better in all those other regions as opposed to the Southern Rhône appellations in Provence. Châteauneuf-du-Pape and Gigondas are becoming overly juicy and alcoholic with the hotter summers these days in Provence. In any case, bon voyage!",2025-04-02 20:23:51,0,BloodWulf53,travel

It's not. It's more like the Colorado Rockies than Glacier NP. But still distinct.

Admittedly a lot of other canadian NPs are not so noteworthy. The ones that come to mind as nice are Fundy Bay and Gros Morne.

What I quickly learned going outside of the US is that the ""brand value"" of being a NP is much more dubious in many countries. Almost all the NPs in the US are amazing and distinct nature destinations, but this is a much less reliable signal in many countries. My advice would be not to focus on them. Definitely still look at UNESCO sites, but beyond that many of the most beautiful areas you can visit will not actually be NPs.

My wife and I went camping in the two parks last summer (5 days in Jasper, and 4 days in Banff), my wife doesn’t like roughing it either so we made sure to stay in campgrounds that all had flush toilets and showers available, but both parks have towns in them that have hotels. We also went back to Banff in January for our anniversary and stayed in a hotel in town. There is plenty of hiking on both parks, and they also have some other really fun activities like boat tours, or gondolas. There are some great restaurants in Banff, literally some of the best food I have ever eaten; Banff has a great distillery called Park Distillery that has some great drinks and really awesome food! There are some great museums in the town of Banff, so if you want a mix of outdoor and indoor activities you have options. If you don’t want to stay in the town of Banff, you can also stay in Canmore (about a 20 minute drive to the park). The drive along the icefields parkway (between Banff and Jasper) is one of most scenic drives I have ever been on, and there are a lot of opportunities to get out and hike, enjoy waterfalls, or explore the Athabasca glacier. They have tours at the Athabasca Glacier, but we didn’t do any of them so I don’t know much about them other than that they exist. If you decide on Banff, I have some recommendations I can make based on my experience just let me know if you’re interested.

I also noticed that you didn’t mention Yellowstone on the list of parks you’ve been too, and if the opportunity comes up you should put that on the list for parks to visit in the US.

Nope, that won't work. You can't apply for a fresh E-Visa while the original E-Visa is still valid and in force. The initial E-Visa has to be stamped out of the country before the second application can be submitted.

>leaving the country and only then applying has left me in another country for a whole mount last time

If you fill out the application properly then generally the turnaround is 3 - 5 days. Oddly enough I had one issued in less than 48 hours a few weeks ago. In any case 3 - 5 days isn't bad for a Visa run.

ml0sgpu,1jpnscg,reddit,"The most authentic feel of the Polynesian culture you'll have in French Polynesia. The infrastructure is good everywhere, the best internet you'll have again in FP. In FP, the most fancy tourists accommodations are on motus with their great over water bungalows. The disadvantage is that your experience of the Polynesian culture is very limited, because the locals live on the island, not the motus. That's why we stay on the islands. The difference between FP and the Cooks is that the Cooks have loads of visitors from NZ and the vibe is influenced by them. It's still great and we go there when we're in FP but the natives, even though they're related, are not as ""native"". We like Rarotonga for its bars, restaurants, markets, live music and sports (Rugby, Soccer).

The rest depends on what you want to see/experience. Naturewise, the islands that have mountains such as Tahiti, Moorea, Bora Bora, but also Rarotonga etc have spectacular views with the lagoon on one side and the mountains (up to 1800 m high) on the other. The Marquesas are offering even more spectacular views, but they don't have a lagoon and less infrastructure. Then, there are the flat islands such as the Tuamotus with great diving options.

Boat tours are amazing. Fishing trips take you out for miles and looking back to the island is just wow. Snorkeling, whale and manta ray watching is closer to the islands but also great fun. Take boats that take few passengers (e.g. 5-7). You can also hire private trips. Also, local guides will take you on walking trips. Here, I can thoroughly recommend Kura Happ (Rarotonga, find and contact her via her Facebook site).

There are plenty lagoons to choose from. We love the ones at Bora Bora and Aitutaki. Bora Bora has a great beach (Matira) with white sand and good snorkeling right off the beach. Tahiti and Tahiti Iti have great black sand beaches. Aitutaki's lagoon is larger and its colors of blue are just spectacular. Only go on a boat trip when the sun is out.

One other thing that is amazing, and is rarely mentioned, is that in FP, the eldest son is sometimes raised as a female and they are then called Mahu. You see Mahus often in e.g. Papeete working in service (restaurants and shops) and they are the sweetest people I've ever came across and I've traveled a lot.

Both Greece and Italy have lots of rocky shores and lots of sandy beaches; it depends on where you go. Tuscany has plenty of nice sandy beaches, for instance.

Your best bet for warm and sunny weather in April in the EU is probably Cyprus or the Canaries. Crete and Sicily, perhaps, it could be very pleasant or rainy and cool.

Any actual town will have places opened in April. It’s only the tiny tourist-only towns on small islands and the like that essentially close down outside of summer. If you want nightlife and meeting people, though, you’ll want a proper city, which contrasts a bit with wanting to just chill by the sea. Also, most cities don’t have nice beaches next to the city centre, because either the core is a port or the seaside was marshland/sand dunes in historical times.

mks3wml,1johy1z,reddit,"In the US, it seems toll authorities often have a way to do a one-time payment based on the plate. But, if you're renting a car, some rental companies will opt you in to their toll-payment scheme (which usually involves ""convenience fees"" above and beyond the actual toll) or a daily pass (e.g. PlatePass which has a daily cost whether you travel on a toll road or not). You can sometimes opt out of those services (just make sure that if there is a transponder in the car you keep it shielded so it's not picked up) and then after incurring a toll go to the website of the local toll authority, put in the license plate, and the range of dates/times you want to pay, and pay them.

Driving through Europe (France and Italy) about a decade ago, most toll booths had at least one lane to pay in cash (often by tossing coins in the bucket). In some countries, you need to buy a ""vignette"" to use the motorways legally (Switzerland comes to mind); sometimes that can be a sticker you put on the windshield (that you buy in a neighboring country before crossing the border) or sign up online with a credit card and the license plate info. From what I've read, a lot of European tollways are putting in credit card readers with ""tap to pay"" (so you might be able to use ApplePay or GooglePay or a credit card with the tap-to-pay symbol).

(On a slightly different topic) One caveat with using US credit cards in Europe (at least several years ago) was that often European card readers were set up with chip-and-PIN authorization but US credit card companies hadn't enabled that on their cards (they had enabled chip-and-signature which wasn't used in Europe). So using a US card at automated kiosks (e.g. unmanned toll booths, metro ticket machines, train ticket machines) was impossible; I'm not sure if that's still the case with the introduction of tap-to-pay.",2025-04-01 00:36:17,1,ImNotFrank55,travel

mkrqh8z,1jofeja,reddit,"Regardless of what you decide to carry outside and regardless of what country you visit, always keep the smaller bags and pouches in front of you, whenever possible; i.e. all hip packs and fanny pack should be worn in the front, especially while walking in crowded streets and markets or while standing inside a tightly packed bus or train.  Sling bags are more versatile than backpacks, but with both, use twist ties to keep pull cords tied together while walking through crowds - it actually deters creeping hands from trying to quickly reach into your backpack in a crowded area.

Google ""RFID Blocking money belt"" and have both you and your gf wear that UNDERNEATH your shirt/blouse/t-shirt (many product photos show money belts worn on the outside around the waist).  That is where I ALWAYS keep my most valuable small/flat items such as US passport, US drivers license (my backup ID), my 1 or 2 credit cards, all my money that may sometimes be more than $3K USD cash because I do not trust hotel room safes, etc.  My phone and wallet (with one credit card and less cash) go inside my front-facing hip/fanny pack or a front-facing zippered pocket; i.e. never trust any rear hip pockets, even if they have zipper or velcro closures.   A flat RFID-blocking money belt worn underneath your shirt and slightly tucked into the top of your pants with the shirt covering it is more secure than any pouch or bag that is worn externally.  The only drawback is that you may look slightly overweight in photos, but unless you only wear tight-fitting tops, no one knows about your hidden money belt, and any attempt to access it will be noticed because you have it slightly wedged into your pants in the front.

Italy is not dangerous, but the larger cities, especially the crowded touristy areas, of both Italy and Spain do have statistically higher concentrations of pickpockets compared to the rest of Europe, the U.S., and Asia.   When I was prepping for trips to Spain during the late 1980s and early 1990s, I had lengthy discussions on the rec.travel Usenet newsgroup (this was before websites were invented) about a common tactic in Spain where a crowd of children would enthusiastically run up to greet you and hug you, but 1 or 2 of those children would be stealing items from your pockets while the other children would provide distractions by pretending to enthusiastically hug you.

If you can leave ALL your jewelry and fancy clothing at home, and do not look or act like a rich or ignorant tourist, that also greatly reduces your risk of being a crime victim in ANY country (my wife and I also leave our wedding bands at home).   I previously lived and worked in Brazil and Africa and my wife and traveled by car through numerous countries (love South Africa, Namibia, Kenya, Ethiopia, etc) where we were often the only light-skinned people in at least a 20-30 mile radius, and we never got robbed because we never displayed jewelry or looked like fancy people in poor areas (we both wore solid tan or brown baggy clothing).  In the poor areas, I took thousands of photos using a small Canon point-and-shoot camera.  In larger African cities, I often carried a Canon 5D in a Think Tank Digital Holster 30.    In some areas of the world, some locals mistaken a camera holster for a large firearm holster and leave you alone (true!)   And during 3+ years of living and working in Africa and visiting numerous African countries, I always wore one of 5 or 6 money belts under my clothing; sometimes the belt gets a bit sweaty after a full day in the sun so I would switch to another belt on the next day.",2025-03-31 23:16:23,1,KrunchyPhrog,travel

mkqhuy4,1job5i4,reddit,"Very generally, San Francisco to Yellowstone over 3 weeks is reasonable. It’s a 14.5 hour drive if you go direct. 

Neither Las Vegas or Zion are on that direct route and so would add significant drive time. For the most part, those will be interesting drives through mountains, forests, and deserts. Up to you on whether that’s worth it. If it was me, I would probably limit the trip to the things that are roughly on the way there… something like San Francisco, maybe Yosemite, Tahoe (+Reno if you want a taste of Nevada Casino culture), the salt flats & SLC, Grand Tetons, and then Yellowstone. 

As you’re finding out Yellowstone is remote and not super convenient to get to. Denver is going to be your closest main hub airport but it’s a 10-11 hour drive away. Your best bet is probably going to be to take a regional flight from Bozeman Montana to another hub, whatever is cheapest and makes the most sense for your ultimate destination.

Paris feels very safe to walk around generally, and I say that as someone who loves staying out by Clignacourt and Barbes, which a lot of folks malign. 


What does your daughter like? What interests her about Paris? If it's just about the two of you getting time, prioritize bakeries and cafes and your river cruise, where you can talk and be together. If she's got specific interests (art, fashion, food, history) build around that.


Staying up around Montmartre (southwestish of Sacre Couer) puts you a little away from the sights you want, but is a lovely neighborhood for a 13 year olds first time abroad, and especially Paris.

Here are my thoughts:

I would take away l’Arc de Triomphe/Champs Élysée and replace it with Montmartre and Sacré Cœur- it is a must for me every time I’m in Paris.

If you go to the Louvre, you won’t have much time in your day to do more sightseeing, so something to keep in mind. Personally, I prefer Musée d’Orsay, but I get wanting to see the Mona Lisa, if that’s your main reason for going. 

There is a free museum dedicated to the Liberation of Paris just across the street from the entryway of the Catacombes. I highly recommend- it’s very well done. https://www.museeliberation-leclerc-moulin.paris.fr/

You will need to book tickets in advance for the museums, the Catacombes, and Sainte Chapelle, so that needs to be factored in. 

Also, it might interest you to a schedule a tour of l’Opéra ( Palais Garnier), it’s a gorgeous théâtre where ballets, concerts, plays are performed. The building is so steeped in history, they give guided tours. https://www.operadeparis.fr/en/visits/visit-and-explore/guided-tours

The train from Bologna to Bolzano takes about 2.5 hours. You can spend one night in Bolzano or add a second, depending on what you want to do and how well you're set up. There are busses and car rental offices near the train station in Bolzano.

When I made this trip in 2023 we had a car and stayed just outside of Ortisei. I can highly recommend this location for a couple of reasons: Good accommodations (but can be expensive), good access to bus routes (our hotel was on the SP64 and had a bus stop out front), there's good access to the Alpe di Siusi and Seceda by cable car (two days of hiking right there), and fairly good restaurants. Castelrotto and Selva are easy to get to by bus (one per hour or per half hour during the day). We had our car but used the bus just as much.

If you elect to rent a car you can get to Cortina and Tre Cime more easily, plus other hiking areas around Bolzano. But with three or four nights in the mountains this isn't necessary.

I assume you'll do a lot of hiking. I can't tell you anything about the night life, I'm old. Often there's not a lot of it in these ski towns in the summer. But lots of young hikers. We had a wonderful time and are going back this fall for our third trip to the Dolomites.

mk78xev,1jlxht6,reddit,"The only way to do this is with a lot of driving. 

I would suggest driving from Bucharest to Curtea de Arges and spending your first night there. The next day take the Transfagarasan road to poenari citadel (the Transfagarasan is a spectacular road - please don't feed any wild bears you may see). 

Once you have seen Poenari citadel continue on the Transfagarasan to Sibiu and spend the night there. 
From Sibiu drive up to Corvin Castle and spend the night in Hunedoara. 


Leave Hunedoara and take the long drive (maybe 4.5 hours) to Peles Castle and spend the night either in Brasov or Sinaia.  For your final night you can choose to return to Bucharest or go wherever you fancy. 


Be aware that the motorway network is quite limited and you will be spending a lot of time on single lane highways, but the scenery is usually spectacular. I have driven many 1000s of miles throughout Romania and I make sure I leave plenty of time to stop off anywhere that looks interesting to me.

mk7bssw,1jlxht6,reddit,"Before going to Poenari fortress check the status of the road Transfagarasan, it tends to close if it snows but usually octomber is still a good month for it. 
My sugestion is to do a loop, stay the first night in bucharest (or around the airport) and then head very early in the morning to the poenari fortress, visit it (might take 3-4 hours) then cross the transfagarasan to the other side and stay a night in Sibiu or around it, then go to Corvin castle and maybe Deva fortress (they are close to eachother), and then head back to Sighisoara, stay for a night and enjoy the city, it’s amazing. Then head to Sinaia, to visit the Peles castle, but on the way there go and see Cantacuzino castle, where Wendesday was filmed, they are both jn the area called prahova valley. Head back to Bucharest and enjoy the last night there. 
Sincerely this is the best way to see your points of interest as the distances are pretty far and the traffic in Romania can really suck (source-I live here).
Romanians use Waze instead of google maps for driving, but google maps should do the trick at aproximating the distances and at choosing acomodation or where to eat. I recomend to stay at hotels with good reviews 8+ score on Booking. 
Also at the last part of your trip, when going from sighisoara to sinaia you can also stop by Bran castle, it’s a bit of a detour but it is doable, but save some time in the next day to fully enjoy peles and the area. 
You can also do this loop in oposite direction. It’s not necesarry to spend the first night bucharest, if you arrive early enough and head to Sinaia first, but make SURE to spend the last night in bucharest, do NOT attempt to drive from the mountains to the airport on the same day, it might get really crazy. Also if heading to sinaia from bucharest make sure it’s not friday, and if heading from Sinaia area to bucharest make sure it’s not sundar because the traffic will be scarier than Dracula itself.",2025-03-28 15:55:32,4,thegirlnextdoor5991,travel

mjvy6u2,1jkizva,reddit,"Hi, taking the car into another EU country is now accepted by some rental companies in Romania (for an extra fee) but yeah, dropping it off abroad will be complicated or expensive.

You can drop off the car in Arad or Oradea, both are large towns near the border, along major routes into Hungary and with plenty of connections to Budapest by bus or rail. 

The main Romanian bus planning site is [autogari.ro](https://www.autogari.ro/?lang=en) , you'll find timetables for the Arad-Budapest or Oradea-Budapest routes.
Train timetables can be found on the international section of the Romanian railways site [CFR](https://bileteinternationale.cfrcalatori.ro/en/booking/search) 

Almost all rental companies allow dropping off in a different domestic location, altough there's usually also a surcharge for doing that.

BTW if you plan on renting from a small rental company with strangely low prices, expect to get ripped off.

Unless you plan on visiting many sites located in rural areas, you can generally get by with public transportation in Romania.",2025-03-26 19:36:08,2,tolanescu,travel

It's more a receipt number that a change ""may or may not"" have been made in response to your inquiry, and it doesn't prevent you for getting flagged for something new in the future.

Put another way: putting it into your reservation doesn't remove the derogatory flag, and not putting it in doesn't restore the derogatory flag. Someone at DHS took a look, cleared the flag (if appropriate) and gave you a receipt number.

montlo8,1k6455p,reddit,"Just be aware that this is around July 4th weekend so a lot of beach towns will be a bit busier and accommodation may be in higher demand.

The drive from Mendocino to Eureka is pretty nice. Most of the drive is through redwood forests, but part of it will be along the coast. You can take a slight scenic detour through a special segment of the forest called Avenue of the Giants. A popular attraction is the Drive-Thru Tree in Leggett. And of course you can stop at Fort Bragg and see the Glass Beach along the way. You can go all the way up to Crescent City if you'd like, but there's not really anything to do up there. The views along the coast as you drive up are pretty great though.

While you're between Eureka and Crescent City, it's worth driving through the Redwood National and State Parks.

If you want to go a bit south, Monterey and Carmel are pretty nice too. Monterey is world famous for its aquarium. And Carmel is a nice seaside town (a little bit more on the posh side) that seems to match what you're looking for.

Santa Cruz tends to be the popular destination for many of us from the bay area when we want to go to the beach. It's probably the most family friendly option so expect it to get pretty busy and for there to be lots of traffic.

For some things closer to SF, you can try Marin County. Sausalito is just across the bay and offers great views of SF, has lots of local shops and coastal town vibes. Muir Woods is great for hiking and lets you see the redwoods without driving all the way up north.

This might hurt you more than help. While it might sound like a reasonable justification for travel, to the US authorities, it's a way you can easily overstay. _Especially_ because it means you don't have immediate family where you are now.

To combat this, you need to bring comprehensive documentation that shows ownership and ties to things at home. A house, a business, documents to prove you're taking care of your family, that kind of stuff.

They'll ask you about your intent to travel, what you do for work, and likely about your personal history. It's honestly anyone's guess.

> What supporting documents did you bring?

Having made several US visas, I just bring as much as possible. College diplomas, employer contracts, birth certificate, the lot. I don't _offer_ them up, but I have them ready on a dime.

Play it cool, stay focused. Don't over-share unnecessary information.

In general, being a permanent resident of the Netherlands should have helped your case the last time. Were you employed at the time? Was your partner employed? Did they have evidence of savings or employment for either of you at the time? The fact that they still rejected your visa application is a concern. 

Becoming a Dutch citizen helps your case a bit. In case of any problems, the US has to deal with the Dutch government and not the Afghan government. And your application for Dutch citizenship probably required a background check. 

Also having a strong reason to travel to the US (cancer diagnosis) helps your case as well. 

But have any other factors changed/improved in the last two years? Do you or your partner have a higher paying job? More savings? A house that you have purchased.

It doesn’t help that the administration has changed, but most of the consular officers on the ground at the consulate are the same. They just have different instructions to operate on the ground.

Because of both knee replacements followed by being hit by a pickup as a pedestrian, I cannot do steps. Even one step without a rail is difficult. I cannot walk quickly or far although i can walk. I requested assistance on all my flights. I didnt see this option when I purchased, although on all ticket purchases there was a spot to request assistance, but I would have chosen WCHS for myself. 

Within the airports, from the check-in desk on, I was whisked around either in a wheeled chair (not always an actual wheelchair), or added to other passengers being driven around in golf carts. Every time, going through security was great; they rushed me through; a couple of times not even a wave of the wand, although usually I had to stand so they could pat me down. Every escort i had was excellent, friendly, helpful. 

Some airports didnt have inside ramps to board; you went to the tarmac and walked up stairs to the plane. For me, they drove me out to the plane in a really cool kinda tiny bus on top of vehicle. Then it got to the airplane, the bus thingie would rise up to the height of the airplane door. And I just walked right in. 

Upon arrival, they did the same in reverse, dropping me off where I needed to go within the airport. I was carrying-on only but the golf cart I was on, on every flight, went to baggage retrieval first. That was a bit of a pain lol.

morgs3d,1k627fk,reddit,"Hey, here is my two cents.

While in Palermo you can definitely drive to Cefalu (about an hour drive) and you're close enough also to Trapani and Erice (about 1 hour and a half). In the Trapani area though I would also try and include San Vito Lo Capo, Marsala and Favignana Island and the other Egadi Islands (you can find ferries from Trapani easily). So Maybe you could just use Palermo for the city itself and Cefalu (and maybe add Caccamo) and then move to Trapani or somewhere arround there? I don't love Trapani so much so any of the other places mentioned here would be my favorite choice for a base while in the area.

Of course you want to see Taormina but there's so much that is nice to see around there and Taormina itself is a bit up on a hill..... I would base myself in Catania and visit Taormina during the day. Etna is an easy drive from Catania (like 1 hour to the trekking sites). Catania has a nice center and from there you can also visit Aci Trezza, Aci Castello, Acireale, Santa Maria la Scala (a tiny fishermen village near Acireale) and the Grotte dell'Alcantara (1 hour from Taormina).

And while based in Siracusa you can see the town itself with Ortigia, Noto and Marzamemi (super tourist trap, but I do understand the attraction). While in the area I would also visit maybe a beach if the season is the right one like (Fontane Bianche) or the Natural Reserve of Vicari (do NOT go on a public holiday or weekend or you're gonna find yourself in line for hours to even just get in). The towns of Ragusa and Modica are also supernice, but the whole of Sicily is dotted with beautiful towns.....

Finally if the time allows I would also try and see the Valley of the Temples near Agrigento. It's not positioned in a convenient way unfortunately but it's beautiful. I gues the closest place to it is Catania which is about 2 hours away. Or maybe you could drive from Marsala (a bit more than two hours and also stop in Mazara del Vallo, Selinute and Sciacca - all beautiful places).",2025-04-24 10:01:47,1,TheGirlFromMilan,travel

moks2fj,1k5thhn,reddit,"*Can* you walk? If you really want to, sure, but it's quite a walk and it's not very pedestrian friendly. Lucky for you there's the free terminal bus that leaves every 5-10 minutes and takes maybe 10-15 minutes to get there. You could also take the metro, but it's not free.

I've done T4 -> T1 and vice versa several times now, and what I can tell you is, that if you have an international flight, 2 hours and 30 minutes is **not** a lot, maybe it's not enough, especially if you've got checked in luggage. (It's definitely not enough if you insist on walking!)

So from getting off our flight, waiting to collect the luggage, getting to the shuttle bus, going to the other terminal, checking in the luggage, passing through security and then exit-migration can easily take around 2-2½ hours (with luggage)! You could do it somewhat faster with only carry-on though, especially if you've checked in to your flight online so that you can go straight to security.

Fine with us, because that means it’s also less crowded. You can spot wild macaques in the trees of Baun Pusak or float with the green and hawksbill turtles around Gili Meno without feeling like there’s a line behind you.

I think SF and Seattle are somewhat similar, but SF is better. They also have a great public ferry you can jump on to Angel Island and back. Grab some food before you hop on. 
Ultimately, with 1 weeks and an open jaw flight plan, I would drive to Portland via Redwoods and 101; maybe stay in Florence, Waldport and then cut in towards Eugene or Salem, and then up I5. You’re not missing much coastal viewing by that point. I mean, yea, there are some great views farther north but you’ve already passed Bandon.

mojyx2y,1k5oo9i,reddit,"I have recent experience taking the coastal starlight from Seattle to San Fran and back. It is expensive, but a pretty unique experience. I heartily recommend it, but it might cut into your budget too much because I view getting a ""roomette"" on the train as basically a must for the 22 hour ride. I would not recommend just raw dogging it in an economy (or whatever) seat unless you can sleep well sitting up (I cannot). Each roomette is private, sleeps 2, and offers beautiful views of the mountains through southern oregon, the Willamette valley, and the north jaunt of the Columbia River. You see very little of California on it, because it leaves San Fran at night. If you like a cozy space where you can spend the day staring out the window, it's a very cool experience. Plus, each meal they come around and assign you dinner partners for the night if you're a part of 1 or 2, so if you're social it's a fun bonus to meet other weirdos doing this long haul ride. There is no wifi on the train.


So part of your question -- where to go. I'd go north, but I'm heavily biased in that. 


If you like to drive, the drive is doable in two days (one if you're bombing through, switching off, and popping trucker pills). What you should keep in mind though is I 5 is your fastest option by far BUT it is not particularly scenic. If you and the missus like long drives though, it's fun too. Anything like the 101 or out to the Oregon coast is going to set you back lots of drive time. The Oregon coast is, for my money, some of the most beautiful coastline in the world, but it's not super close to much else that you say you wanna see. 


If you home base in Seattle, you could rent a car and do pretty easy day trips to Vashon Island (granola, artisan cider, orchards), Bainbridge Island (cute little berg of Winslow and wine tasting rooms), Mt. Rainier, and etc. You wouldn't NEED a car for Seattle, it's got good busses and a good train north south, but a car is still probably worth it just for ease of jumping around town. There are SO MANY beautiful parks in Seattle (Lincoln, Discovery, Seward, Volunteer) so they in of themselves are worth seeing. Don't stay downtown. People fearmonger about it, but it's not a safety thing so much as it is just kind of a desert down there -- but DO go to Pike Place and the Seattle Center, both are worth it.


Best hoods to stay in -- Ballard, Fremont, Capitol Hill, or Wallingford, but each neighborhood's got good shit. 

The San Juan's are very cool, and the ferry in of itself is awesome, but it's a two (ish) hour drive to Anacortes to catch the San Juan ferry, and then a 3 hour ferry ride, and while the islands are great for R and R, focusing there may make you feel PARTICULARLY like you're missing out, given that you've outlined a lot of other ambitions.

If you have a week, then I'd stay focused on a certain region (ie around SF).. north you have Point Reyes seashore, Tomales bay, Inverness, Russian river and south you have Big Sur. Further north you can make it to redwoods.  All of these are beautiful. 

Or, you could fly to Seattle and spend a few days there and then up to San Juan's...note that you'll need to make ferry reservations in advance (and also get to the dock 1hr before) so logistically that is time consuming. But orcas is also one of my favorite places on earth so I'll always take the time.

mojwj3u,1k5oo9i,reddit,"Sounds like you have about 1 week.  That's not much time.  Here's what I would recommend, but of course everyone is looking for different things.

Redwoods - That's a 1-2 day trip and I wouldn't try to squeeze that in

Oregon Coastline - Not easy to get to.

Drive from SF to OR/WA - I would not recommend this.  You are either driving I5 with nothing to see, or along the coast and will be extremely long drive.

Napa - The only reason to go to Napa is to say you went to Napa.  Wines are great, but Napa is VERY expensive and can be extremely busy during summer, especially on weekends. If you like wine and want a great wine tasting experience, I would drive out to Sutter Creek / Plymouth area instead of Napa.  There are dozens of great wineries near Sutter Creek, much more affordable, much more laid back, and a much better wine tasting experience than Napa.  This is going to sound crazy, but with your budget, look at getting a cabin at a place called the 49er Village in Plymouth, or for a bit more money look for a B&B in Sutter Creek.

From Sutter Creek, it is a quick drive up to Lake Tahoe.  If you've never been to Tahoe, that is a must see.  Spend 1-2 nights in South Lake Tahoe, take Gondola up to top of Heavenly, check out Emerald Bay, do some hiking if you are in to that, or drive up to Tahoe City and go rafting down the Truckee river (very easy), if that's your thing. 

Next, drive down back to the coast.  Check out Santa Cruz (Beach Boardwalk), then spend 1-2 nights in Monterey (Aquarium, Cannery Row).  Take 17 mile drive on your way out (pull off the road to spend a couple hours walking along the ocean cliffs and tidepools).  Stop at Point Lobos, Big Sur, etc. and then drive the coast Hwy 1 down to San Luis Obispo/Pismo Beach.  Spend 1-2 nights in Pismo Beach, beautiful in the summer.

It's not as dangerous as Rio, but I don't recommend walking the streets after dark (public transportation in Santiago, particularly the metro, is very good, but bus frequency drops significantly at night). Uber is plentiful throughout the day.

November is one of the best month to travel in Chile. If you can, try to visit other parts of the country as Santiago is our biggest city but it’s not as nice as the rest of the country.",2025-04-22 20:14:18,3,Signs25,travel

For Namibia We just had a 2wd vw polo hired in windhoek and camped in our two man tent and also stayed in local accommodation in the towns. In namibia you can buy fresh food and meat in both supermarkets but also in etosha itself.  I wouldn’t destroy my holiday eating freeze dry!  Go for the hearty bobotie, kudu steaks and boerwors!

Same with botswana where we were at least able to get basic staples - pasta vegetables etc.  But the lodge food was better than our cooking.

We just had a basic trangia stove, but only used it where there werent restaurant options.

Namibian food is very hearty and tasty - german and sth african influenced.

Its pretty cold at night but you usually get firewood if you stay in the  campsites.

Not sure if your trip allows it but we really liked the hike up to bushmans paradise in spitzkopje (with chains - its steep).
We also did the waterkloof trail near soousuvlei/Tsauchab.  We stayed at Tsauchaub river camp which was good.
We stayed in the camps just outside etosha because they are much cheaper and easier to book…and they were really nice - even if you are just camping.   E.g Onguma camp (etosha east) - had a really nice bar/restaurant and pool that you can use

Alot of the namibian camping lodge options include outdoor fires and woodfired showers which was a nice change after 3 months of cold showers for us.

Please forgive any spelling mistakes.  I haven’t had dinner yet and my keyboard sucks.

Not sure if your will have room in your camper,but we learned that its customary to pick up local hitchhikers.  There is hardly any public transport, so its great to give locals a ride to the town.  They often to walk long distances to do daily  life.  We met lots of interesting people that way.",2025-04-23 07:28:14,2,marktthemailman,travel

Absolute Africa 
G adventures 
Intrepid 
Oasis 
Nomad.  

I think Africa overland is a broker, not a tour operator.   But I'm not particularly familiar with them.  

Oasis and nomad tend to be higher end.  

Intrepid and g adventures are mid-budget,  and depending on the trip you go on at least some of the time. People are more interested in drinking than anything else.  

Absolute is the cheapest, and it's the one I went on.  

One thing that may not be clear from their marketing material, if you look at their longer trips you can get on and off that trip at really any point.   So you might be able to do a more customized trip depending on what you want.  

With any of the overland tours, and the guide will make or break your trip.   You don't have a lot of control on the group you're on, but if you're looking at the under 30 trip, expect that there Will be a lot of partying.   

If you choose to go on the absolute trip, I would see if you can figure out which driver/bus you'll be on, and if you can manage to get the gray truck it's good . .   I would avoid the trucks with the roll-up windows.

Sit down meals? 30+euro/per person/per day

Street food/vendors? 10-15 euro/per person/per day

Using grocery stores for produce/deli/breads? 5-10 euro/per person/per day.

Just depends on preference.

When I was in Germany last April, I typically had breakfast of food I had purchased at the grocery store the previous day (yogurt + pastry + fruit) ~3-5 euro. For lunch, I would have grab a bratwurst on a roll from a street vendor / small butcher shop (5 euro). Dinner would sometimes be a doner or durum wrap, maybe 8-10 euro, from a corner restaurant.

mnzv7mx,1k34wy9,reddit,"From Lansing to Cheboygan/Mackinac City is about 220 miles. How do I know? I took that drive more times with my family as a kid than I care to count.  That gives you some sense of the distances, but also I wanted to point out the Mackinac Bridge and Mackinac Island are really great places to visit.  If you started up there and worked south you, you would probably use 2-3 days total. Even 1 night on Mackinac Island would be nice -- rent bikes and ride the 6.3 miles around it, or do it as an easy hike. Ferry service is fast and plentiful. You can't walk across Mackinac Bridge (except around Labor Day), but I think you would find even a round-trip drive to be pretty cool.

Working south, catch M-119 -- the tunnel of trees -- at Cross Village and take it south to Harbor Springs. Harbor Springs is a lovely town and you can easily find good places to eat, summer concerts, and various festivals.  Keep going south-ish and you'll hit Petoskey which is another very cute town with nice highlands that give a good view of Lake Michigan in spots. Pick up M-31 there and head to Charlevoix, which sits on a small channel between Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix.  It's a great town and would be my pick for where to spend the night on day 3 or 4.

From there, you could head to Traverse City on M-31 (it's maybe 50 miles from Charlevoix), which is the biggest city in the NW part of the state (about 20,000 people). Plenty of parks, concerts, festivals, etc. It's also the gateway to NW Michigan recreation.   If you don't want to spend any time there, you can continue west to Sleeping Bear Dunes. A little to the south there is good kayaking and canoeing on the Crystal River, and there are several outfitters in the area. Once you finish your day you could make good progress south along M-31 or M-22 (slower, but more on the coast).  Overnight someplace and then you have a day or two for west coast beach towns on your way back to Indiana, such as Grand Haven, Saugatuck and perhaps Holland (not really a beach town, but lots of outdoor recreation in the area).

I cannot say about Puglia as I've never been.",2025-04-18 21:08:17,5,IcyResolve956,travel
mnv5mlv,1k2fdba,reddit,"Travelled to both regions in June over past couple years. I’d expect Puglia might be slightly less busy than algarve in August, but only marginally, these will be very busy places in August regardless. Beaches/hiking wise I think the algarve is better, specifically Lagos is wonderful for beaches and a coastal walk along the cliffs, and the town is lovely. A bit of a touristy town but the food is still good.

However id say Italy wins for food in general between the two options. Food is incredible and some of the best I’ve had in Puglia and you’re more likely to find authentic experiences in some of the smaller towns like martina Franca, locorotondo and ostuni if you venture out of Bari for day trips - some of these towns are inland and not coastal but still wonderful to wander about for a day. lovely beaches in polignano a mare which is not far from monopoli but is quite a popular beach spot. One slight downside though is that driving in Italy is a bit of a nightmare imo.

Overall for a relaxing beach/coastal break I’d say Algarve fits more of your criteria. For Puglia I’d say to enjoy what the region offers would take a bit more effort as there’s so many places beyond Bari and monopoli that are amazing but not necessarily by the beach, and so might not be what you’re looking for. Both are amazing regions and you’ll have a great time either way!",2025-04-19 02:24:42,3,Responsible-Monk8272,travel

Some thoughts....

* packages are usually not a money saving thing, they save you time in planning as everything is done for you.  That being said - Costco is one of the better options.

* most of Caribbean is out(or at least a big risk), but not all.  Some islands(the ABCs for one) do not get hit too hard with hurricanes....usually.

* Clear, blue water and pretty beaches - this is the main thing you are looking for it sounds like.  Hawaii and Caribbean are really your main two options.  Pacific is not that clear unless you are in Fiji or S Pacific....which is no good for 5 days.  SEA - great for 2 weeks, not for 5 days(would probably fit your budget for 2 weeks)

Not a ton of options to be honest.  Can do SEA on the cheap, but need 2 weeks IMO.  Hawaii should be doable if you plan yourself and are flexible.  Caribbean islands - ABCs, TnT(more advanced), Grenada...have a few options.  Cartegena with a day trip to an island is another option....but that is not a ton of time on the beach.

mnm5wsp,1k1grau,reddit,"> Is there stuff worthwhile in Southern Sumatra, or are we better off blasting full speed to Jakarta once we're done with hiking adventures around Medan?

There are two primary reasons to do the Sumatra trek: nature, and food.

Each part of Sumatra has their own local cuisine, and it can be worth visiting the cities just for that. Padang food is very famous, so I know several people who went to Padang just for food adventures alone.

Alternatively, there are natural things to see, like Lake Toba (very geologically interesting) or the canyons of Ngarai Sianok and Harau. These can be fun, but they're not exactly the best the country has to offer, and can be a challenge to get to. Interesting stops on a big road trip, maybe, but if you're tight on time, a lot of effort to get to.

You may also have other less common interests, like surfing the west coast, or the anthropologic exploration of the various tribes, including some really old groups who still live on the island.

Basically, figure out a map of what might interest you, and see if it's worth going there.

> How many days would you recommend devoting to just Jakarta as opposed to exploring the rest of Java?

The thing about Jakarta is it's not designed for visitors. That's the harsh reality. The city is an economic engine for the country, and is a big, jammed up, dusty city.

However, I actually think Jakarta is worth a night or two, especially in a few situations.

First, if you have any interest in Indonesian culture and history, then definitely visit. Check out the museums, see a couple monuments, hang out at Taman Mini.

Second, if you want to socialize, Indonesians are pretty open to visitors. My personal secret is to come on Sundays and chat with locals during the car-free morning. Or exercise in GBK or just walk around during afternoons.

Third, food. Jakarta is the melting pot of all Indonesian cultures, and there's a LOT to try. Explore some night markets, try restaurants, just hang out on google maps.

Fourth, shopping. It's not that Jakarta is great at shopping, but for local goods, it's a hub to find lots of stuff from around. Visit Sarinah for that. OR just run around in the malls. It can be fun for visitors just to acclimatize to Indonesia.

A few random side tips:

- Stay in the downtown core near an MRT or LRT station.
- Use said MRT, LRT, or KRL train networks to get around as much as possible. The bus network can also be good, but may be affected by traffic.
- Use google maps and grab/gojek apps or bluebird taxis if you need car access. Be aware that the city is a mixed bag in terms of sidewalks.
- Don't be afraid to ask for help if you get lost. The city is a maze. Locals ask for help all the time.
- Check out Bandung or Bogor nearby for a change of pace.

> How safe would this trip be for families with young children? Our friend group includes parents with a 2 year old that may decide to join.

Broadly safe. Be aware that Sumatran roads have a reputation at night, but statistically it's not very clear how real that is. 

Do beware of dusty roads and hot sun. 

> What is crucial information to know, or materials to pack, in order to ensure a great time in Indonesia?

As tourists, you may draw attention. This is pretty much curiosity. Some people may try to engage in conversations or take photos. You don't have to oblige, but these people usually aren't trying to scam you or something.

Follow the crowds to find good eating.

Indonesians dress relatively conservatively. You won't get in trouble for wearing shorts, but you might stand out.

Have cash on hand.

Try things out. That dodgy-looking satay stall that pops up at night might have the best damn beef of your life.

For what it's worth I'm Australian but I've lived in Turkey and spent years travelling throughout SE Asia. I'm also mum to a three year old. I've thought about going back to certain places, but Indo is pretty tough going for a toddler. Outside of Bali and parts of Java, Indonesia gets very rural, very quickly. If you're expecting Turkish levels of infrastructure, safety, hygiene etc you're going to be sorely disappointed! It's an amazing place and loads of fun but with a bub you have to consider safe food options, water, access to medicines etc... all of which are much harder to come by (if not impossible) in the sticks. The thought of being on a dodgy Indo chicken bus with food poisoning and a sick child is terrifying.

Even in touristic places like Mt Bromo you'll have trouble finding hot showers, comfy beds and quality food options. Cities like Jakarta and Jogja are no problem but rural areas are a little more challenging. Not impossible, but it's not really a ""beginner"" destination.

In terms of standards of accommodation, food hygiene, medical access, transport safety etc I'd say Thailand is on par with Turkey, but Indonesia still has some way to go.

mngjl3q,1k0pitw,reddit,"The Midwest is not where many of the characteristic American sights are, but it is a great place to see what some might call ""real"" America, with polite Midwesterners, especially if you will be in Oshkosh anyway.  In Wisconsin, you have plenty of cities and smaller towns that are very interesting, plus old Lake Michigan resort areas that are still popular.  I'd look into Door County, Madison, Milwaukee, New Glarus, and Taliesin, and Galena IL.  The eastern shore of Lake Michigan has more, like Traverse City, Holland, Saugatuck, and others.  The Lake Superior shoreline of Wisconsin and Michigan has beautiful parks as well.  The Indiana shoreline has Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore.

For other interests, Route 66 started in Chicago, and you can drive some remaining parts in Illinois, especially Springfield to Dwight or so, and a museum near Bloomington.  And Springfield has Abe Lincoln tourism.   And of course Chicago, if you want to see a baseball game, concerts, museums, excellent restaurants, the blues, etc.

You'll get a great feel for America even if you don't see the great parks or other interesting cities.  No need to fly to the coasts for what is a fairly short time period.

Maybe do the Great Lakes circle, driving all around Lake Michigan and stopping at many resorts and interesting towns along the way.  It can take 10 days if you go easy.",2025-04-16 19:14:03,1,notassigned2023,travel

If you want to travel to smaller towns and the countryside without a car then western europe will be easier to get around but if you are constrained by your budget then eastern/south eastern europe will be the better option although travelling around will be harder without a car. 

In Germany smaller towns and villages are usually more beautiful and more historically preserved. Germany also has the Deutschlandticket which costs just 58€ for a calendar month and is valid in the whole country. You can take every bus/regional train/tram/subway/light rail in the entire country with this ticket. Basically every train except for long distance IC/ICE is included in the ticket and the public transit network is reasonably dense in Germany. You could pick a region and explore or go north to south or east to west with some stops throughout the country. Germany also has loooots of beautiful palaces and medieval castles to see. Hotels in smaller cities should also be cheaper and transit costs within Germany would only be 58€ so you could turn this pretty budget friendly.

Switzerland has the best public transport network in Europe but is also 50-100% more expensive than any other country in europe. The nature is really beautiful and wherever you want to go you can pretty easily reach.

Austria is cheaper than Switzerland with similarly stunning nature. It is still on the pricier side compared to other european countries but not nearly as extreme as Switzerland.

Spain and Portugal are also really nice. They are on the cheaper side, the sea is not that far and the cities there are really beautiful.

Karakoy is gonna be pricier but still a great option if you wanna be in the middle of it all.

Kadikoy is kind of a pain in the ass to transit late at night but it'll also have everything you're looking for and the vibes have been good. Uber is honestly a decent option, it'll just call a taxi anyway but at least you can dispute and or contact Uber if the charge ends up wrong.

mn2b7qe,1jytnia,reddit,"If you're comfortable with driving, I'd recommend sticking with your initial plan to rent a car. The ruins get very busy, so it's good to have the option to visit in the early morning before the tours start arriving. A car also gives you the option of staying on a quieter part of the coast (we were happy with Akumal), but still dip into Tulum or Playa del Carmen. Our experience with driving was fine: good roads, reasonable traffic, never got stopped by the police.


As for the ruins, Chichén Itzá is the big one, and you'll want to stay a night in Valladolid to get there first thing in the morning. Uxmal and the Ruta Puuc sites (Labná was a favourite of ours) are also wonderful to visit from Mérida, if you have the time. Coba is perhaps less impressive, but its forest setting is beautiful, especially if you go first thing in the morning.

mn3gp9r,1jyf0n1,reddit,"As someone who has been to PR several times, I feel like Vieques and Culebra are a *little* overhyped and a bit of a pain to get to for what people are expecting vs reality (meaning there are some fantastic beaches and things to do that don't require a ferry/flight to get to).  These aren't super glamorous resort/nightclub islands, they are ""rent a golf cart and find some secret beaches"" islands.  

Puerto Rico is VERY chill and rustic outside of San Juan.  The entire island is filled with hidden beaches you could sit and enjoy without a lot of other people nearby for hours.  It's not a ""rent an umbrella"" type of place.  San Juan would be the exception, where a lot of beach front is operated/owned by hotels that are set up along the beaches in Carolina.  So really, perhaps that's a better option for you if that's what you're looking for?  Would also be closer to the action for nightlife.  But I often say if you don't leave San Juan when visiting PR, you might as well have stayed in Miami.

I like Rincon personally.  The food there is some of the best on the island, and the beaches are calmer/more swimmable compared to the choppier east side.  There are also some decent VRBOs in that area within walking distance to a beach.  It's just a bit of a drive to get to, 2-3 hours by car from San Juan.  Some people hate that idea, but honestly it's the perfect mix of ""cute downtown"" and ""remote country"" that is very Puerto Rican in my mind.  Also has a cool ""surfer vibe"" as north along that coast has some killer waves that attracts all sorts of water sports fans.  

Otherwise I would recommend Luquillo on the other side.  I personally don't like the food as much, but you can get nice VRBO apartments in a place called Playa Azul with beautiful views and is on a public beach that feels empty majority of the day in the off season.  It's also close to hiking/the rainforest and is closer to San Juan for fast day trips in.  The famous Luquillo kiosks are also where the nightlife happens, and would be a fun place to enjoy an evening or two.  You would also be close to the ferry to Culebra/Vieques ferries if you still wanted to head there for a day trip.

Some policies will only kick in after 24 hours, which is too long for me. Next I'm looking for pre-existing coverage provisions.

If you are a US resident then you would insure your trip before your departure, not when you have already travelled and are already on your trip, hence the cancellation benefit would only apply before or on the day of your trip. Cancel for any reason is to be used up to 2 days PRIOR to the start of your trip and AXA pays up to 75% of your non cancellable Non refundable trip costs!

In order to receive a waiver for pre-existing medical conditions travel insurance companies require that you purchase a policy within a time sensitive window of your initial payment on your trip and that you insure the costs of your trip that are subject to cancellation penalties.

As far as wheelchair friendly cities in Serbia go, I'd personally only consider the northern part of Serbia and cities like Subotica. It's a historically rich city with plenty of things to see and do. Feels like a nice combination of Hungary and Serbia at one place(mostly cos it was a part of the Austrahungariam empire).

There's a few other cities which could be friendly such as Sombor, but I don't think it's worth the visit.

I'd suggest you looking out for Subotica, but id you're looking for Slavic culture and tradition, you probably won't find that there either.

mmk09bc,1jwl73n,reddit,"Most of the Balkans are sadly not accessible. Many of the cities are located on or around hills which are quite steep. Public transport will also not be accessible. Old vehicles or car friendly planning usually means that there is a step or gap you have to cross in order to get on a transit vehicle. Car friendly city planning also means lots of parking on sidewalks and narrow sidewalks to begin with. Businesses also don't usually have ramps, especially if the building it is located in is older.

Your best bet will be flat cities where you won't be reliant on public transport. I agree with the other commenter, northern Serbia fits this quite well. Subotica or Novi Sad are pretty flat and small enough where you don't really need to take a bus. 

In Bosnia and Hercegovina cities are usually hilly or have really poor public transport so bad luck there. 

The city center of Belgrade is also ok and public transit there is free at least but lots of trams and buses require a step to get in. New Belgrade across the Sava river is also flat and the large boulevards also have large sidewalks attached to them but the area is not that beautiful and you will have to use public transport to get to the center. The streets from the center to the river are also quite steep, so public transport will once again be required. There is a big push for new vehicles currently as preparation for the EXPO 2027 but these might not be on every line yet and they don't always stop flush with the sidewalk.

Sarajevo is famous for being hilly and I doubt that the transit vehicle situation there is a lot better than in Belgrade. If you stay in the city center it should be fine but the hills start early and there won't be a lot of city left for you to comfortably reach.

Banja Luka I believe does not have public transport. It has some privately operated bus lines but not much more than that. The center is fairly flat but it is not that large and accessibility will probably be pretty poor for businesses. You will also be stuck as public transport either doesn't exist or is so poor that it is not worth using.",2025-04-11 12:56:24,2,EmbarrassedBadger922,travel

It sounds like Black Canyon and Glenwood Springs are your top destinations, so I'd base your itinerary around those. 

Skip the first few days of your itinerary by taking Highway 285 straight to Black Canyon (about a five hour drive). Spend 2 days there, then drive through Paonia to Highway 133 to Glenwood Springs. The scenery here is gorgeous. OR you could go to Aspen/Snowmass and see the Maroon Bells, the most photographed mountains in the state. Stay in the area for 2-3 days, then visit Glenwood. 

You could also go through Grand Junction and Palisade after Black Canyon on your way to Glenwood instead of going up 133. Colorado National Monument is beautiful in the spring if you like red sandstone desert environments. Palisade has a fruit and wine trail that's fun. There's kayaking on the Gunnison and CO rivers here too. 

Keep in mind that hiking trails in the high country will still have snow and mud on them. If you're planning long high altitude hikes, bring ice trekkers. The weather can change from sun to snow and back to sun in an hour. 

Also, eat at Sal Mex restaurant in Glenwood Springs, it's a bit away from the downtown area but the food is absolutely incredible.

motb78k,1jvb2f8,reddit,"Hello, Scoot is Singaporean budget airline / low cost carrier. I am Singaporean and have done long haul on Scoot (Athens-Singapore, 11 hours). Here are my thoughts:
1. Check the prices. The price tends to look cheap at first but the basic fare only has 10kg cabin, nothing else. You can select the package for 20kg check-in and seat selection to check prices (or try ala carte check-in baggage).
2. Related to point 1, I did a cursory search using Google flights and found British Airways tix to be comparable in price but with layover in LHR. 
3. Their upgraded seats (“business” class seats) are called “Scoot Plus”, which has more plush seats, leg room, and perks alike a full carrier, but the price point never made sense to me.
4. Basic / economy seats have no in-flight entertainment. Comfort is so-so. Not as bad as other regional low cost carriers but of course not as comfortable as full cost carrier. 
5. Delays— yes, I have experienced delays with Scoot. On my Athens trip, and a separate Seoul trip. Delays were not too long, maybe 1-2hours. A bit annoying but bearable. I recommend checking your email / messages for notifications on delays before you set off for the airport.
5. Cancellations— I’ve flown Scoot many times and have never experienced cancellations or rebooking.
6. Scoot is owned by Singapore Airlines. While their standards of course are nowhere close to SQ, the customer service is reasonable. Better than other regional low cost carrier (e.g. AirAsia) but also more expensive for the short haul Asia flights 
7. Yes, they may weigh your cabin bag. I personally find the 10kg cabin allowance quite generous for a budget airline. 

Unfortunately I’ve never taken Ryanair or wizzair so I can’t make a comparison.

  Denver to Breckenridge, Vail and Aspen and all in the same area.  However I70 can be a mess during the winter (or summer for that matter) backed up with lots of traffic and sometimes parts closed due to weather. 

  Lodging will be expensive as its ski season. 

  Weather would be anything from mild, cold but sunny to full on blizzard.  You wont know until about 3 days before. 


  I would probably skip Telluride, and go Denver to Breckenridge, then Vail, then take HW 24 --> HW 285--> HW 50 to Crested Butte. Then if you have time backtrack to Aspen.

  However this will be on a lot of winding mountain roads in the middle of winter...  Some of these roads are closed in the winter, so you need to take others that will extend the driving time quite a bit...


  However this is a LOT of driving for a week...",2025-04-09 14:19:15,1,SJ1392,travel
mmbclb9,1jv4y8j,reddit,"Colorado is very big and the highway is very busy. Trying to go to all these places that are scatter around the state is not possible in one trip. Aspen is practically 4 hours from Denver for instance.  There is almost too much to do and too many great towns to go to so you gotta start narrowing it down and make multiple trips to see it all. All of the activities you named can be found up near Winter Park and Granby ski resort, but the biggest most luxury ones are Breck, Vail and Aspen. If you’ve only have a week you need to pick one main spot to stay in, and MAYBE make two day trips to other towns. I would think Breck, and the Winter Park/Granby area would be my choices since you want all the snow activities and festivities. Vail is beautiful too and could be the other day trip",2025-04-10 01:21:13,1,Dalionking225,travel

In Tuscany I can recommend some wineries or I highly recommend Grape Tours as a company to arrange travel and tastings (they operate out of Florence and maybe other cities, I'm not sure). 

Bordeaux is a huge wine region to tackle, with both left and right bank regions that cover a lot of ground grape-wise. I'd recommend a tour company as well for that, especially to be able to enjoy the wine without worrying about driving. St. Emilion in particular is a gorgeous medieval town at the heart of right bank wineries.

I like walking then sit for a coffee, walk then get lunch, walk then have a beer. Sit outside when possible. Smoke a little weed and find great food at great prices. NO kicked ass. French Quarter wild with tons of partiers on weekend nights. During the day theres a few bands playing at all hours. The craziness was fun for a bit but I found a chiller bar after a couple hours and just sat by myself soaking up how beautiful at was. Next day just walked around the Garden District all day. One of the prettiest neighborhoods I've ever seen.

  Went to Puerto Rico last year for the first time last year. San Juan center is gorgeous of course. and sipping rum and puffing a cigar for the first time was cool haha. Was good for a few days. Cant always swim at the beach there it can get very rough.  Wish I had bussed or rented a car to drive to a beach i could swim at. The mountains are a great trip. If you get to the west coast there are crazy cheap hostel situations. Like 15 a night for a tropical situation.

mog7wk9,1jtqrak,reddit,"I can help with this honeymoon dilemma! Having experienced both destinations, they offer completely different vibes after Langkawi.

Your wife's concern about Bali being boring after Langkawi isn't something I'd worry about. Bali offers a totally different experience - Langkawi is more about resort relaxation and beaches, while Bali has incredible cultural experiences, beautiful rice terraces, temples, and a variety of landscapes from volcanic mountains to beaches. The food scenes and cultural elements are completely different.

Your husband's point about Singapore being expensive is valid - it's definitely pricier than both Langkawi and Bali. However, Singapore offers amazing urban experiences, world-class attractions (Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay Sands), incredible food options from hawker centers to fine dining, and excellent shopping.

For a 3N/4D extension on your honeymoon, I'd personally recommend Bali. With that timeframe, you could split your stay between Ubud (cultural heart, rice terraces) and a beach area like Seminyak or Uluwatu. I used Seek Sophie to plan parts of my Bali trip last year and it made things so much easier - they helped arrange a private driver who knew all the best spots and timing to avoid crowds.

Singapore is amazing but might feel rushed in just 3 days, and the contrast between laid-back Langkawi and fast-paced Singapore could be jarring for a honeymoon. Bali would give you more bang for your buck and provide memorable experiences without breaking the bank.

Once you're here, Aldi Talk is probably the best option for you, I'd probably get at least the Tarif M plan, which has a speed of 100mbit/s and is currently 14,99€ for 28 days. The annoying thing with this is that you'll have 30Gb for free usage, but once you hit the 29th GB you'll have to ""order"" another 1GB through the Aldi talk app, otherwise data speed will be drastically reduced. Doing so doesn't cost anything, and you can do it indefinitely, but it's just very annoying. I have no idea why they do this.

mluae6x,1jt3067,reddit,"Hey, I just spent 5 days at Shangri-La Rasa Sayang and it was fantastic. 

The resort is located about 35 minutes from the ""city"" of Penang, at Batu Ferringhi. Around there, there are plenty of restaurants, a hawker style centre which was great, Starbucks, restaurants on the beach etc. At Rasa Sayang, there were quite a few kids there, the pool is great. Good service by the pool as well. Breakfast was absolutely fantastic, lots of western options and great local options too. One thing I really liked was that all of the rooms at Rasa Sayang face the pool area, and had a balcony too. We stayed in the Garden Wing, whilst there is a Rasa Wring - that wing is better, but I don't think they allow kids. It has a more formal restaurant where you need to wear smart casual clothes, no resort wear, and the pool doesn't allow kids under 16. Now next to that resort, is the Golden Sands, which is also a Shangri-La property. It has a kids pool area with slides etc which looked really cool - and you could literally just walk up there and get in the pool as if you were a guest - they're all more or less connected to one another, so we liked that there was a huge area that we could take advantage of. 

The only downside of the Batu Ferringhi area is that the beach out the front of Shangri-La has eroded away unfortunately. So the area immediately at the front of the resort has no beach access, but about 200 metres down the path, you can get onto the beach. 

In the city itself, we spent maybe two days wandering around, trying different cafes and restaurants, photos and whatever else. We went to this place in Penang called the Upside Down Museum... my partner chose it and I was... a bit annoyed but we got in there and honestly, we had so much fun ... look it up, I think your kids will probably love it. As two adults, we actually laughed so much it was really cool, as a family I think it would be a fun experience.
