travel,1k27uou,Spain 8 nights itenary - help me decide,"Hey everyone, 

Finally I've narrowed it down to Spain from Italy, France (Italy the best option but looking to avoid this due to the Jubilee this year not sure if i should just take the chance).

Nonetheless planning for a 8-9 nights in Spain around September mid (hope the weather will be decent).

My thought process so far,

Land in Barcelona  
Spent 3 nights in Barcelona  
Fly to Mallorca : Spend 3-4 nights there (base in palma may be)  
Fly back to Barcelona : Spend the last night there and take the flight back to Toronto.

But here's where the dilemma comes in. I'm a big Real Madrid fan and if I'm travelling all the way to Spain, I will definitely regret not visiting Santiago Bernabeau. 

Is there a way I can fit Madrid in? Thought about taking one way flight to madrid and return to toronto from barcelona but tickets are way expensive this way compared to a return flight to/from barcelona.

Overall what I'm looking for in this whole trip,  
\-Vibe is to explore the city (i can skip some monuments/main tourist attractions) but this is more of a relaxing trip for me.  
\-Need a beach vibe where I just sit and relax. I don't want to be running around much.

Help me with figuring this out.   
\-Is Mallorca a must visit according to what I said above? Or should I think about skipping it and visiting other parts closer to Barcelona and add Madrid in there.  
\-Or is there a way I can fit everything in.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts. ",1,0.99,3,2025-04-18 15:35:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k27uou/spain_8_nights_itenary_help_me_decide/,Coach-Alert

travel,1k1invr,Advice for Trip to South of France,"My partner and I are planning a trip to the South of France for 10 nights in September. We will be flying into Nice on the 13th of September, and then back home from Lyon on the 23rd. I was hoping to get some input on a possible itinerary for us. 

This is our initial plan:

* Two nights in Nice
* Two nights in Cannes
* Two nights in Marseille
* One night in Aix-en-Provence
* Three nights in Lyon

We will be traveling between these cities by train or flixbus. We do not have access to a car and are on somewhat of a budget. My partner also gets very travel sick and 4.5 hours on a bus or train is their absolute limit. Please do let us know if these cities are the right places to visit or if we should consider other places instead and whether these amounts of time in each city are realistic.

I will provide a brief list of things that are important to us in a vacation, in order:

1. Food. Not fine dining (again, budget), but we love trying regional foods. My partner is a real sweet tooth too.
2. Seeing the sights/walking around. Sounds a little dumb, but our favourite thing to do is just to wander around the city. Maybe look around a few shops (books and comics especially) or sit in a park.
3. Nature. We’re not big hikers and we do not have access to a car, so I’m sure many more ‘nature-y’ places out of the city are out of the question, but we do enjoy seeing green/natural spaces.
4. Beaches. Not looking to spend 10 days baking in the sun, but two or three afternoons on the beach would be nice.
5. Other activities. My partner isn't into museums and we are on a budget, but non-museum activities/sights that are under 15eu pp might interest us.

Please let us know if we should amend our itinerary or if you have tips for any of the aforementioned places!",1,1.0,2,2025-04-17 17:33:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k1invr/advice_for_trip_to_south_of_france/,gayliens98
travel,1k1hnqu,Where else can I go for tropical vibes for my birthday?,"Hi, I want to take a trip for my 25th birthday this year in August with my boyfriend and I’m leaning on settling with Hawaii. I’m kinda settling because I don’t have much experience traveling out of the U.S (tbh traveling in general 😭), but I want to go somewhere tropical. I’m still open to the idea of traveling outside the country though. We mainly want to swim in beautiful blue CLEAR water. I keep second guessing where to go because I know Hawaii can be pricey, so possibly I could go somewhere better/similar for the same budget price? Our budget is ideally 3-4k. I know, 4k max budget is crazy low for Hawaii, but I think it can be done lol! 😂 Through Costco travel, I found a package to Ohau that included flight, hotel stay for 5 nights and car rental for  around $2300 total, departing from Sacramento.

My parents have gone to all-inclusives in Mexico, and I’ve found a few all inclusive packages from Costco Travel that cost around the same or even less than the Hawaii packages. BUT, I’m also iffy about traveling to that area like Cancun because of the hurricane/sargassum season during that time. Our main reason for traveling to these places was to swim in the beautiful clear beaches, so I don’t know if I should risk the trip out there with the sargassum.

Any advice for this newbie traveler is welcomed! My boyfriend and I both have our passports too, so I’m open to putting those to use!",1,1.0,1,2025-04-17 16:52:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k1hnqu/where_else_can_i_go_for_tropical_vibes_for_my/,No-Win-6976
travel,1k1hb4r,Best place for a day trip from SE Pennsylvania?,"I have a day off from work next week and am in desperate need of a change of scenery, something fun to look forward to, and a chance to unwind a bit. I'm also incredibly decision fatigued from work and life, so this is my attempt to outsource the decision of where to go and what to do. 

I'm within what I consider easy day-trip distance of DC, Baltimore, Wilmington DE, and Philadelphia (I've been to everywhere except Wilmington at least once, Philly the most often, but I don't feel like I've even come close to fully exploring any of these places). Also open to hearing your pitch for smaller towns in those areas that I might not have considered. 

Where should I go, and what should I do while I'm there? My go-tos in new cities are always museums, bookstores, and cafes, but I'm open to other suggestions--anything that you think would help me feel a bit refreshed and reinvigorated, I'm feeling so bored/burnt out/uninspired lately and a change of scenery usually helps. 

I don't have an unlimited budget, but I don't mind paying reasonable prices for museum admission or a decent meal. ",1,1.0,6,2025-04-17 16:38:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k1hb4r/best_place_for_a_day_trip_from_se_pennsylvania/,Charming-Thought170

Questions:

1. The general plan is to go via taxi/bus from Medan to Jakarta and then finally to Bali. The trip will be roughly 16 days split 3 ways for each location. *Is there stuff worthwhile in Southern Sumatra, or are we better off blasting full speed to Jakarta once we're done with hiking adventures around Medan?*

2. How many days would you recommend devoting to just Jakarta as opposed to exploring the rest of Java? My only other big trip was Turkey and I remember wishing I had spent additional days in Istanbul just to scratch more than the surface.

3. How safe would this trip be for families with young children? Our friend group includes parents with a 2 year old that may decide to join.

4. What is crucial information to know, or materials to pack, in order to ensure a great time in Indonesia?",1,1.0,6,2025-04-17 16:16:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k1grau/im_planning_a_potential_panindonesian_roadtrip/,Left_Click_5068

travel,1k1eao7,Going to Southwest France/Northeast Spain this summer and looking for ideas!,"My family 3 Adults(68, 45, 44) and 2 children (14,11) are going to taking a trip this summer and I would love some recommendations. We are Americans. We don't speak French and we have very basic Spanish but we have no problem getting by even with language barriers.

* Flying into and out of Nice.
* We are renting a car(have experience driving in Germany/Czech Republic but not France/Spain so if there is anything we need to know chime in... We did get a ticket in Czech Republic for driving on a toll road without paying the toll. I though there would be toll plazas. There are not.
* We MUST go to Carcassonne(Family Bucket list item is to play Carcassonne in Carcassonne) but not sure how long to stay there. 
* We do not need to spend as much time in bigger cities. We tend to like mid-sized and smaller cities and we like to wander although we will almost certainly go to Barcelona and are open to bigger cities.
* We love culture/food/wandering. Small museums. Wineries. Off the beaten path touristy things. Small walkable cities with interesting history. Unique experiences (Making chocolate from raw cacao in Mexico). Good restaurants but not necessarily fancy. 

We did Amsterdam to Cologne to Prague 2 years ago as a family and learned a lot about what we do and don't like.

* Flew in to Amsterdam, which was great. Very walkable. Unique. Loved Van Gogh Museum and seeing the Ann Frank house was very moving and eye opening for the kids. Touristy, but very enjoyable. Best part was just walking the city.
* Cologne was cool. Loved the Cathedral. We stayed in a small city, Neuss near Cologne and we liked it. Meh... Cologne is cool but other than the cathedral I wouldn't really care to go back.
* Wandered to Quedlinburg. Loved the drive. Stopped at a few places along the way. 
* Spent 3 days in Quedlinburg(Playing the game Quacks of Quedlinburg in Quedlinburg was a highlight) and loved just walking around the city. This is one of our favorite travel experiences. Restaurant Helena was our favorite meal in Germany. 
* Wandered to Dresden via Leipzig and did a factory tour of the Volkswagen Glass Factory. Another highlight. 
* Drove to Prague and spent 5 days in Prague. We liked Prague, but it was too touristy. Enjoyed some of the tours. Would have cut this down to 2 days if I did it again. Favorite things in Prague were a Plague Tour where we wandered the city at night with a ""Plague Doctor"" and he told us about the history of the city specifically during the multiple plagues. 
* While in Prague we took a day trip to Kutna Hora (where the bone church is). Loved it. The Cathedral was our favorite cathedral we saw on our trip. The drive too and from was great as well.
* Drove to Nuremburg and stopped in Pilzen on the way. We liked Pilzen. One of our favorite meals of the trip was at Le Frenchie café) and Nuremburg was OK.
* Flew out of Frankfurt.

Were thinking about wandering through Andora. Is it worth it?

As a side note, we ~~like~~LOVE factory tours. The Volkswagen Factory was really cool. We like nature but aren't looking for long nature hikes. Food is huge for is. Love good restaurants but not chains. Bonus points for fun/unique history and culture things to do.

travel,1k1c45n,Africa itinerary for December,"Travelling to africa in december. We have planned 10 days self driving through botswana chobe-> moremi->nxai pan->elephant sands. Then to mafia island in tanzania to see whale sharks, then a 7 day tour in uganda (falls, rhinos, chimps, gorilla's etc)

However, I would prefer to self drive in Uganda, but they will not let me book it this far in advance for that short of a time.

My girlfriends and I are heading to SLC early May for a girl's trip. We are in our mid-30's. Would love some suggestions from locals on how to make this an amazing trip (we all need it lol)

We love a blend of activities, outdoor, and just fun city vibes - nice sunsets, nice views, etc. Not big on sports.

 * Hiking: Read that we are too early for the season (Muddy, Biting Gnats, ETC). Was hoping to see if anybody had recommendations on ANY possible trails or recommendations for moderate hike (short a few hours). Read that it may be possible at silver lake, donut falls, living room trail. We are also going to the Salt Flats. Would it be possible to hike at the Silver Island Mountains? Any trail recos? (Maybe Graham Peaks?)

 * Restaurants: Looking for Vibey restaurants with delicious food (Dinners + Weekend Brunch with Mimosa. Any must-do recos? Was looking at places like Arlo, Urban Hill, Eva, Finn's, Maybe Provisions or Ivy & Varley for brunch - But really don't know if these are worth it!
Would have loved to do a restaurant and drinks with mountain views, especially on our way to the salt flats - but struggling on finding a place. Alta Lodge will be closed. Not sure is Snowbird's base-views are worth it.

 * Things to do? Any insider recos and tips would be super cool! Any seasonal things that we shouldn't miss?

 * Bars / Drinks: We like R&B Music and top 40 hiphop. We like nice speakeasy vibes for cocktails. We like nice views and good vibes. We like dancing. We are down for live music. This is the area that we really don't know lol. Wrote some stuff down online but really don't know!

travel,1k0st04,Milford Sound from Queenstown,"Hello, I know there are a few posts about this but wanted to get some comments on our specific situation. We will be in Queenstown in beginning of July and plan a trip to Milford sound with 9 and 11 yr olds. Here are the different scenarios to consider:

We’d like to have 2 days (1night) for the trip.

1 We will arrive to Queenstown in a Campervan and thought we could keep it and return it until we get back. So we thought about driving in the campervan from QT to MS, then stay at the powered campsite there. Either driving very early, do the boat tour and stay the night. Then drive back the next morning from MS to QT.

2 Second option is to return the campervan and rent an SUV, then same thing drive to MS but now we’d have to either stay at the very expensive cabins in MS one night, or stay a night in Te Anau either the night before or the day right after the boat tour.

3 Take a 12hr tour in bus same day. (I think this might be too tiring and we wouldn’t be able to stop for photos since I heard the road has some amazing scenery for photo stops.

I‘ve heard different opinions and would like to have more information to make our decision.

I've been to Bali in november of 2023. I really enjoyed the trip due to the following factors and i am now searching for a new destination which is not Bali but checks the same basic aspects

\- obvious things first: The weather beeing very humid and warm. 30-35°C with 90% humidity is just amazing

\- scenery of Bali and Nusa Penida. The combination of tropical forest, seaside and a bit mountainous areas, waterfalls and also dry areas of nusa penida

\- not sure whether we were lucky but it was never crowded (probably good timing of november)

\- calm areas and smaller restaurants as well as very cheap street food

\- destinations beeing quite close so that I can drive by scooter from hotel to hotel

I am not looking for the crowded parts of Kuta or Ubid with the fancy cafe's, bars or clubs nor big beaches to relax.

We rented a scooter both on bali and nusa penida, and drove around ubud, Gobleng and as mentioned nusa penida, visiting waterfalls and enjoying the scenery. I want to take my drone with me again and idealy do something similiar: rent a scooter go with a backback from hotel to hotel and explore places, flying my drone and enjoying calm areas. 

I am thinking about thailand (without any specific areas yet) but I am not sure whether bigger distances make the idea of going by backpack on a scooter impossible.

travel,1k0nita,"Vietnam - Sept, Dec or May?","I am planning a trip to Vietnam with some family members and was looking for some insight on which month would be the best to visit between September, December or May. We will be visiting Hanoi, Hoi An and Saigon. Looking online it doesn't seem like there is a perfect month since the weather varies so much between the north & south so I am having a hard time deciding when would be best. 

We are leaning towards Nov 29 - Dec 11 which looks like the rainy time in Hoi An area but the dry season for Hanoi & Saigon. Is their frequent flooding in Hoi An around this time in Dec? Will it impact travel or does it typically clear up quickly if it floods? We would like to avoid extreme heat and are okay with not being able to visit beaches. We are from the Philly area so are use to colder weather in the fall / winter. 

I added our Itinerary at the bottom. Would love to hear people's experience with weather if they have traveled during any of these months!

**Option 1:**  
Lisbon (4 nights) - Coimbra (1 night) - Porto (5 nights) - Lagos (3 nights) - Évora (1 night) - Lisbon (day of flight)  
  
**Option 2:**  
Lisbon (4 nights) - Porto (5 nights) - Lagos (3 nights) - Évora (2 nights) - Lisbon (day of flight)

Must-see spots we're including:  
  
**Lisbon** – exploring the city +  
Day trip to Nazaré, Óbidos, Batalha, Fátima  
Day trip to Sintra, Pena Palace, Cabo da Roca, Cascais  
**Porto** – exploring the city +  
Day trip to Douro Valley  
Day trip to Aveiro  
Day trip to Braga  
**Lagos** – exploring the town +  
Day trip to Benagil Cave & Carvoeiro  
Day trip to Faro?  
  
Or  
instead of Lagos, we do Albufeira?  
  
Question 1 - We're debating whether to squeeze in Coimbra for its university and vibe or give more time to Évora. Is Coimbra worth the quick one-night visit? Is Évora worth 2 nights or is 1 night enough to soak in the vibe?  
Question 2 - We're debating whether to visit Lagos or Albufeira, as reaching Lagos seems like a very long hike from Porto versus Albufeira which is closer to Faro airport.

travel,1jzqoeh,Insight from frequent flyers,"Hi flyers,


I like to think I’m a fairly experienced flyer, but I don’t fly enough to have any kind of status and not too little that I don’t know what to do. I just recently took two US domestic flights (EWR to SEA, and then SFO to EWR). There were some things I noticed and some things I had questions/curious about from the frequent flyer community. 


1. I have been flying United for years and have been a mileage plus member as well. I have always been in boarding group 5 regardless of selecting an economy plus seat or even a preferred seat. Is this only a status thing? I’m not asking to be in group 1 or 2, but how am I never in group 3 or 4? 


2. Do you prefer to check in bags for domestic flights? Or do you just check everything in and don’t have to drag your bags around? I know some people have connecting flights and checking in wouldn’t help them in that situation. But for all others, what do you prefer?


3. I noticed some posts on this sub and on other flights related subs about asking for upgrades at the gate. I mentioned I don’t have any status with any airline. But every time I’ve flown, I make it a point to ask the gate agent for upgrade chances right near boarding time. 9 times out of 10, it has worked for me. Just recently on my trip from SFO to EWR, I got upgraded from all the way last row to an economy plus seat. I know there are factors like how empty the flight is, status, upgrade cost, etc. But it has worked for me most of the time. Others have similar experience?


4. As frequent flyers (or just experienced/capable flyers), do you look down on people who may not know what they’re doing or do you offer to help? I’ve seen both types of people, which is why I’m asking. There was someone on my flight who was clearly struggling figuring out her seat and her tv monitor, but nobody helped until she called for a FA. I also took a flight where I was seated in an emergency row window seat with a missing seat in front of me, so I was confused where to put my backpack. The lady in the row in front immediately turned and helped put my bag below the seat in front of her for takeoff and gave it back once in the air. I just wanted to ask the frequent flyers if you’re willing to help or let the FA handle it? 


5. Flying etiquette. Is it normal for people to take shoes/socks off during flight? Is it ok to lay down if your row is empty and you have all three seats to yourself? Any other flight etiquette issues you have seen? 



I’m asking these as a way to get insight into how people fly and how to improve my own experience moving forward. Thank you for any advice and/or suggestions! ",1,0.99,7,2025-04-15 12:30:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jzqoeh/insight_from_frequent_flyers/,AfroManHighGuy
travel,1jzmgic,2 Weeks in Vietnam,"Me and my partner are heading to Vietnam this May for a 2-week trip. We're flying into Ho Chi Minh City and looking to keep the trip relaxing, with some light cultural bits, great food, and ideally being able to scooter around somewhere chill, not super urban.

I've already done Sapa, Hanoi, Lào Cai, and Ha Long Bay on a previous trip, so we’re trying to stick to the middle and south of the country this time.

Here's the catch: I’ve searched around this sub and everywhere people seem to be saying things like this.

* Hoi An – “too touristy” ""beaches are gross""
* Phú Quốc – “feels fake/commercial”
* Con Dao – “not the real Vietnam”
* Da Nang – “just a big city with a beach” ...so I’m a bit stuck.

What I *am* looking for is something with the same vibe as Ko Lanta in Thailand — laid-back, scenic, scooterable, not too built up but still with some options. Could be coast or countryside, or even a combo.

is anyone able to give me advice on how bidding works? i don’t want to bid too little and not get the seat or bid too much and get ripped off. 

on the other hand when’s best to upgrade? its an airbus A350-100 plane with 16 upper class seats total, 7 of which are currently available. do i wait until nearer the time? or do i pay the £1k to ensure i will have the upgrade? or am i getting ripped off?

I was wondering if someone who’s local or has been to the area could have a look at my itinerary and let me know if it sounds like a good plan—or suggest something better.

My partner and I are flying to Toulouse for about four days (not full days, since the first and last are mainly for travel—but we do have an early inbound flight and a late outbound one) in June.

My idea was to spend one day in Toulouse, stay overnight in a hotel, and then head to Carcassonne the next morning. We’d spend the afternoon there—have lunch, maybe do a wine tasting—and then in the late evening, drive toward the coast.

I found a beautiful seaside town called Collioure, but it’s quite far, so I’m not sure if it’s worth the long drive given our limited time. I was also considering staying somewhere closer to Narbonne Plage, but based on what I’ve seen on Google Street View, I’m unsure if it has the right vibe.

We’ve done a lot of traveling around Europe specifically but we’ve never step foot in Asia but a lot of our bucket list destinations sit within this continent. 

As we are both now approaching 30 we wanted to tick some of our bucket list items off and see a few areas of SE Asia before we settle down and try to create our own little family. That being said, I’ve put together the below itinerary for our trip and would like some suggestions or opinions on what we have planned. We could only get just under 5 weeks off work and our trip will be ending with 4 nights in Tokyo which I have not included as it is a non-negotiable for us. The itinerary has taken into account many of the ‘tourist hotspots’ that we would like to visit as well as some other activities. 

Just a little side note, northern Thailand is not something we are that keen on due to the travel route I originally planned but I’m open to being convinced otherwise.

travel,1jyyst2,Second time visit to Istanbul - where to stay?,"This will be my second visit to Istanbul with my partner, we're in our early 30s. We'll be there for three full days May 31 - June 4 before flying off to Athens. We're both foodies and interested in nightlife as well as nature. We're definitely not instagram rooftop bar kind of guys. It would be great to use this experience to deepen our sense of the city.

Last time we stayed in Cihangir and enjoyed it, but we're keen to not be too close to Istiklal/Taksim given recent unrest. Where would you recommend we stay? We're happy with staying off centre for sure, especially if there's transit that isn't super indirect. I've looked into the Asian side but seems getting back from the European side late at night isn't great, and I'm aware of the taxi scam when crossing the bridge (had to quite strenuously fend one off in the past!). However, if it seems like there's more nightlife on the Asian side this could change things.

We are looking for beautiful sea, tranquility, not too crowded beaches, archaeological sites to visit and a safe area to stay. Reading various posts, I found many contrasting opinions, especially on which means of transport to use: my initial idea was to rent a car at the airport in Cancun and move around the Peninsula changing town every 3 days, but many talk about how tourists are often stopped by the police and asked to pay bribes in cash, and this worries me, it doesn't give me an idea of ​​great safety. Also heard very bad stories about Tulum and its tourist traps, very sadly because it was my first option. So now I'm considering  to take an ADO bus from the airport to Playa del Carmen, and spend the whole week there, using it as a base given its central location, and then maybe move around with organized tours to the ruins of Tulum, Coba, Valladolid, Chichen Itzà and some cenotes, plus a day by ferry to Cozumel or Isla Mujeres.

travel,1jyjb7p,One-Month Road Trip Advice – NYC to LA via Miami & New Orleans,"Hi all! I’m planning a one-month road trip across the US (flexible dates between May and August). My main city stops will be New York City, Miami, New Orleans, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles. I love big cities *and* offbeat attractions, so I want to mix tourist highlights with hidden gems and quirky stops along the way.

**Route Help:** What’s the best way to connect these dots? I’m thinking of starting in NYC, driving down the East Coast to Miami, then west to New Orleans, and onward to Las Vegas and L.A. Is this too much for one month? Any route tweaks you’d suggest (or must-drive highways vs. ones to avoid)?

**Car or No Car:** I’ll likely rent a car for flexibility, but I’m open to flying a segment if it saves a lot of time. Did anyone do a similar multi-city trip without driving the whole way? (I’ve heard drop-off fees for one-way car rentals can be high – any advice or alternatives?).

**Interests:** I’m into nature, roadside oddities, local food, comedy and live music, and art museums. Some specific things I’d love to find on the route: cool small towns, “world’s largest” roadside attractions, kitschy museums, beautiful hikes or parks, maybe a comedy nights in unexpected places. For example, I’m curious about the Blue Ridge Parkway, New Orleans voodoo tours, Texas barbecue joints, alien stuff in Roswell, the Grand Canyon, Joshua Tree, etc. If you have favorite hidden gems between any of my major stops, I’d **love** to hear them!

**Timing:** How should I budget my time? Of course I want a few days in NYC and LA each, but I also don’t want to shortchange the journey in between. If you’ve done a coast-to-coast trip, what would you recommend in terms of nights on the road vs. in the big cities?

**Other Tips:** Any can’t-miss detours or events between May–Aug? And any tools or websites for planning this kind of complex route? (I’m using Roadtrippers and Atlas Obscura to find odd attractions already).

Thanks in advance! I’m feeling both excited and a bit overwhelmed by the planning, so any advice or personal experiences are much appreciated.",1,1.0,4,2025-04-13 22:03:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jyjb7p/onemonth_road_trip_advice_nyc_to_la_via_miami_new/,blackscreenpancle

Is it possible to buy a travel insurance (trip and medical) policy for travel to Africa with an effective start date and departure from Europe (example: Spain, Italy, France, UK, Portugal) even if original residence of the traveler is in the US.

Example:
Traveler is already in EU from the US 
Example: US to France to US (one itinerary)

Buys travel insurance for another itinerary 
France to South Africa to France (insured trip)

Also some advice around how to use CFAR and preexisting conditions waiver

It looks like CFAR only works for cancelations 2 days before a trip and they only pay out between 50-75% of the trip cost.

And Pre existing conditions waiver requires purchase of the plan within 2-3 weeks of booking.

Most companies only offer 10-15 days to cancel a policy for a refund.

Is trip insurance really important when most companies will either rebook people if their trip is cancelled or delayed or offer compensation these days.

In addition it’s also relatively cheap. On the flip side, I’ve also been told it’s a no go because it rains a lot thus limiting the outdoor activities and also the ability to see the views that these places offer which is another reason I want to go.

My partner and I (late 20s) will be visiting Indonesia for the first time for 18 days in August and we are finding it really hard to craft our itinerary.

The first thing we would like to avoid is mass-tourism, so we are definitely skipping Bali. We would like to find places a bit further away from the common touristic path in order to explore more closely the culture and way of life.

Some things we would like to see/do in our trip are:
- Renting a scooter to explore an area at our own pace 
- Volcano trekking and waterfalls
- Beaches, preferibly with lush green vegetation (i.e we have seen pictures of beaches in South Lombok and they don't all appeal to us so much)
- Optionally, doing surf for one day if it fits (beginner level)

We initially thought of Yogjakarta/Mt Bromo/Mt Ijen, Lombok (we have read mixed reviews of it though, even though Mt. Rinjani is appealing) or some parts of Sumatra (here we don't know much as it is massive, but seems stunning).

1.	⁠I have forgotten to register for Careem in my country so I must have to register it in sharm el sheikh but I couldn’t register on Careem (Middle East’s version of Uber) because I couldn’t do SMS verification. I didn’t know how to activate my Turkish line for SMS. Learn it from youtube, it is easy.

2.	⁠Avoid using the Royssat bus station in Sharm El Sheikh. It felt completely unsafe because no one is there. Only you are waiting for your bus there. It is like a Hollywood horror movie. Even if you bought your ticket for royssat, you can go to watania which is more modern because watania is the second station of all busses after royssat. Do not go to royssat! Go to watania. Also, watania is more closer to city center.

3.	⁠We had a $100 bill and we could not changed it. Some banks in Cairo were randomly closed, and even ATMs or exchange offices often don’t have enough cash to give change for $100. Time was running out, so we took an Uber to the airport. I thought that I can change it inside the airport, so I went through security, but the exchange desk didn’t have enough USD to give me change either. Luckily, I saw another tourist exchanging dollars. So, now exchange office had 95 dollar to give me as change. Meanwhile, the Uber driver was waiting outside for 15 minutes. When I finally tried to go back outside to give him his fare, the police didn’t let me exit. I didn’t know that after you passed the first security, you cant go outside again. It is different in Turkey and European countries. After begging the officer several times, he agreed to personally take the cash to the driver, but he asked me some tips.

4.	⁠In Jordan, when we returning from Wadi rum to Amman, I have decided to stop at Ma’an because there is a wonderful bakery having delicious deserts of which I have tasted before. The bakery is Hasheem Affouri. Also, google reviews are great. We thought that Jordan is more modern and safe country after we saw Wadi Musa and Wadi Rum which are the most touristix cities of Jordan. We had wrong. Do not go to Ma’an which is dangerous. Only men are outside in the city and always stares you. We did not know that there is also Hasheem Affouri bakery in Wadi Musa. Buy your pasteries in Wadi Musa.

travel,1jy4fg0,Chile 72 hour transit visa from Australians,"Hello my partner and I are from Melbourne, Australia and we are travelling to Colombia.

As part of our travels, we have a transit stop in Santiago, Chile both on the way there and on our return to Melbourne.

On the way to Colombia, we have a transit stop in Chile for around 9 hours.

On the way back home, our transit stop is around 5 hours.

We understand that Australians require a visa to enter Chile, where the transit exceeds 8 hours or you are required to go through/immigration customs to collect your baggage.

We have applied for a 72 hour transit visa and awaiting these from the Chile Consulate.

We are a little nervous and want to ensure we are doing the right thing.

Our question is, will the 72 hour transit visa be sufficient for the return trip from Chile to Melbourne? I.e Once the visa is granted, will it allow for multiple entries and exits (ie just can’t stay for more than 72 hours each entry - ie you need to be transiting) or will are we required to obtain separate transit visas for each leg of the trip?

We are staying in Grindelwald for a week and obviously have seen many videos on the Stoos ridge hike, which looks absolutely beautiful. But it seems quite far to get there via train if we make Grindelwald our base. Is there an equally beautiful ridge hike closer to Grindelwald?

Or perhaps is there one that is a short day trip from Zermatt, Appenzell or Lugano? I ask because we haven’t decided on where to spend our last three days, but it will be one of those locations and if there’s a scenic ridge hike near one of them, that may be our deciding factor on where to stay.

I and my wife will be visiting Mauritius from India. I was looking at the car rental and I am totally confused with a few things. Ideally, I am looking for a car rental with full insurance and no deposit. Any suggestion on that front. 

Should I go for discovercars or easycabs? Are their insurances worth it? Can I rely on insurances provided by the local rentals?

What is a excess? It is mentioned at a lot of places, not sure what it is. 

How are roads in Mauritius? Should I worry about them? I consider myself to be a very safe driver and as an Indian, already know how to drive on the left hand side of the road.   
  
Should I worry too much about the deposit? Read at the few places that while handing over the car, car agencies try to make you sign the papers so that they can claim the deposit as people are looking to catch the flight.

\- if we get lucky, standing room tickets at the opera

**Day 2**

**-** bright and early Schönbrunn Palace (Get there *early* to beat the crowds. Book tickets ahead for the Grand Tour with the imperial rooms) - maybe strudel show + zoo

\- we'll take a break and then do the hofburg palace complex + maybe the spanish riding school

**Day 3**

– Visit Belvedere Palace to see Klimt’s *The Kiss* and wander the gardens

\- afternoon we're going to do MuseumsQuartier -  go into the Leopold Museum or just lounge around the MQ courtyard with a coffee.

\- Go for an evening concert : a Mozart/Strauss concert in a palace or at the Musikverein.

**Day 4**

We're trying to get a good mix of outdoors activities (keen for some good hiking and a horse ride or two, biking and kayaking also an interest), viewing wildlife, experiencing the natural hot springs and mountain town vibes of the state, and good food & craft breweries with some live music. Struggling to find a schedule that isn't too packed but fits in some of the key things we want to do - the tricky one being that we want to do the Black Canyon and my partner really wants to do the vapor caves in Glenwood Springs, which doesn't make for a convenient drive when we have to start and end in Denver!

- from Denver
- then to Colorado Springs (GotG, Cheyenne Mtn, Manitou Springs?)
- then to Cañon City (Royal Gorge)
- then to Salida (Poncha Springs, Buena Vista?)
- then to Gunnison (Crested Butte?)
- then to Montrose (Black Canyon)
- then to Glenwood Springs (Iron Mountain Springs, Vapor Caves)
- then to Golden (Red Rocks)

travel,1jvbv84,Recommendation for a mid-august trip in Europe,"Hello everyone, reposting this with additional details as per Rule 4.

Me and my SO will both have our vacation days available in mid-august, from the 11th to the 24th, and will likely pick the second week.

Since a few years ago I have avoided visiting cities during summer to avoid the heat, instead opting for spring and autumn, but we have not yet visited a city together, and have instead opted to stay in the mountains relatively nearby (northern Italy) in our travels together so far.  
I would like to change things up this year, buuut I would also like to avoid heatstroke.  
Is there an European capital or cities in general that are not too terribly hot that you would recommend?  
By terribly hot I mean we would like to avoid a weather comparable or worse than how it is in northern Italy during the summer, usually in the mid to high 30s and lots of humidity.  
I think countries at a similar latitude as Italy would not work because of this, ruling out Lisbon and Athens for example, don't know about Eastern Europe.

There are some that I'd rather not pick because one of us has already been there, or because we plan a group trip in the future (Iceland) , so the ones that have come to mind so far were Dublin, Amsterdam and Oslo (where unfortunately one of the museums I would like to visit is closed currently, so I would postpone).  
There's also Warsaw, which is a bit more towards the south, Helsinki and the Baltic states, these I haven't read up on much yet.  
  
We have been, by ourselves, to Berlin, Paris, Prague, Wien, Stockholm, Madrid and Copenhaghen, and both really liked Prague in particular (and I also enjoyed Wien a lot, I found them somewhat similar).  
We enjoy museums, castles, old towns and so on, the standard fare, and we hike a lot during the year, so if there is any interesting destination for one day outside the city, it would be cool as well.  
  
We would likely stay for less than a week, budget would be in the 150ish € per night range, more if necessary (: as long as the hotel is in a decent position, is not dirty and the beds are not made of stone we are fine, we would be spending most of the day out and about anyway.  
  
Any recommendations? I am focusing mostly on capital cities, but I know that of course there are plenty of amazing places all over, I just tend to opt for them when I first visit a country, but if you have any other kind of suggestionfor smaller towns and other areas it will be definitely a welcome addition, as there may be more options that involve cooler temperatures.

travel,1jv8o2d,5 Extra Days After Machu Picchu in August: Stick to Peru or Jump to Argentina?,"Hey all, I just scored a 5-day trip to the Sacred Valley and Machu Picchu (early August) through my company. My wife and I are thinking about extending our stay another 5–6 days. Originally, we wanted to head to Argentina, but we’ve heard August might be iffy for travel/weather.

**So here’s the dilemma:**

* **Should we keep the adventure going in Peru?** If so, which regions or activities should we hit? We love hiking, fly fishing, and exploring new cultures/cities.
* **Or is Argentina still a must-visit**—even if it might be cold or off-season?

For context, we’re from Montana, so we’re used to higher elevations, cold, and some wind. We really want to make the most of these extra days.

travel,1jv32ki,"Inexperienced traveller asking for advice on trip to France, Spain, or Italy including vineyard tours/tastings - detailed post","Hi all. I've long been interested in short holidays from the UK to some of the biggest wine-producing countries in Europe, but I'm not an experienced traveller. I'm also what you might call ""geographically challenged""; until I've been to a country/place, I find it very difficult to figure out distances or what's on offer nearby. 

I've done some Googling about vineyards and places to stay, and also tried to have a look around south-west France on Google Maps. With both, I've just ended up more confused than I started. I've also done some searching here, but thought in the end it's better to start a thread with my specifics, seeking advice.

Since I'm not very versed in travelling, the below are based on best guesses. Please can you share your ideas?

**Budget**: £2000 for flights and hotel for two people. Other activities/tours/taxis/travel not included in this budget.

**Duration**: Either 5 or 7 days (including travel).

**Where you’re starting**: We live in Scotland UK, so we'd be looking to travel from Edinburgh/Glasgow, or Manchester airport if necessary. At a stretch we could fly from London airports, though this would be much less convenient.

I'm interested in visiting France, Spain, and/or Italy and seeing some vineyards in those countries. I'm not talking about going to \_all\_ those countries on one visit; it'd be an either or/one country per trip. What I'm asking for is good areas - and within that maybe narrowed down to places/hotels - to stay in those countries based on the rest of the information.

We'd be looking for comfort, peace, and quietness in our hotel/place to stay.

**Interests & preferences**: My husband and I like quiet hotels and pretty views, and are looking for areas to visit in the countryside rather than cities. We especially like staying by the sea and this would be a bonus, though appreciate this may not be possible in all cases when trying to be near vineyards. 

We also like good food and would be looking to include plenty of that in our trip, be that within the hotel or in nearby towns. 

Due to health reasons I can't walk very far, and distances need to be supplemeneted by automotive transport (e.g. taxis, or possibly driving although this latter is not very useful if we're visiting vineyards - want to be able to enjoy the wine). Although this detail on walking/health might limit how much we can do or how far we can go in a given day and may mean we need to stick close-ish to our hotel, it is what it is. 

We'd be looking for a slow pace trip combining some activities and some downtime, not packing in loads of stuff every second of the day.

I'm interested in visiting vineyards especially, to both look round them and partake in tastings of their wines. Please see list below of favourite grapes and so vineyards (/wine areas) I'd prefer to narrow selection down to.

We would also be happy to soak up some culture/things to see or do in quiet, small nearby areas.

Favourite grapes so far: 

* France: Malbec, Syrah, and Grenache; secondary favourites Cab Sav and Mourvèdre
* Italy: Sangiovese, Amarone; secondary favourites Primitivo and Montepulciano 
* Spai: don't know Spanish wines so well. Do like Tempranillo (esp in Rioja blends) but that's fairly standard I guess

If we go to France, I'm especially keen to see some vineyards associated with my favourite grapes there. Of the old world wines, French is my favourite wine region. In general of course there's never anything wrong with trying new-to-me grapes and finding new favourites!

I hope this post has enough detail. I'd welcome any advice or thoughts on where we should stay, and the vineyards, food and activities that fit with our parameters here.

travel,1juwozz,Moving flights a year into the future,"My wife and I had booked flights with Emirates for a Europe trip. We are meant to fly out early June and return mid-september of this year. 

Turns out we can't go this year. We now want to move our flights to roughly the same dates next year. The problem is that airlines won't book that far into the future. 

I rang Emirates. They said my only option is to cancel our flights and cop the $1,000 cancellation fee. Oh, and those comfortable seats we booked at over $400? They are nonrefundable. 

I'm now wondering whether it would be better to change the booking to a couple of months into the future, then change it again when the actual dates I want become available. The double change would cost around $900, and the seat booking would be carried over, so theoretically I'd be over $500 better off.

Safe to say we had an amazing time as a family! Despite some minor bumps and some tweaking on the itinerary on-the-go, we would say the trip was a memorable one - particularly Yosemite NP was a highlight. Stunning views, majestic trees and good weather all round.

  
So now we're planning for our second trip in the summer (June) of 2026 and would like some recommendation as well as advices. As of now, we have narrowed to two options, but still early in our brainstorming stage so we're open to other ideas

Our criterias:

i) 3 weeks time span

ii) Something slightly different in our National Park experience than before

iii) 1 or 2 stops in a big city would be nice as a break from sightseeing and a little shopping.

  
**Option 1 - Miami, Everglades NP, Great Smoky Mountains NP, Washington, Philly and New York**

First few days in Miami, take a flight to Atlanta, rent a car to GSMNP and road trip all the way to Washington - a few days there, then Philly and lastly New York

  
**Option 2 - Las Vegas, Grand Canyon NP, Zion NP, Denver and Rocky Mountains NP**

Start off in Las Vegas and then road trip to Denver while stopping at Grand Canyon NP and Zion NP for a couple of days each before arriving in Denver and explore Rocky Mountains NP.

  
I'm looking for inputs on weather, stop options (activities for families), how many days are recommended and whether the road trip journey is even feasible. We are also aware that the World Cup will be happening during that time and also partly hoping that we can get tickets depending on which option we take.

We don't mind spending only 3-4 days in each NP as we found that 4 days in Yosemite NP is enough for us family.

On the first look up the Economy of China Airlines A350 seems more comfortable then Cathay Pacific B777s but the food supply at Terminal 1 in Taipei seems not so good concidering the long transfert.

travel,1ju7sqy,Looking for advice on travel insurance for long trip to Canada & USA (from Belgium),"Hi everyone!  
I’m from Belgium and in a few months, I’ll be traveling with my family to Canada and the USA for about 6–7 months. Right now, I’m in the process of comparing different travel insurance options and could really use some advice from others who’ve done something similar.

I’ve received an offer via my insurance broker from Allianz — they cover the first 90 days, and after that, it’s €2 per person per day.  
Another option I’m considering is the Visa Gold card from Crelan, which offers coverage for up to 180 days, but the medical assistance limit is only €25,000, which seems quite low for North America.

Has anyone here dealt with a similar situation or has experience with long-term travel insurance for North America? Any recommendations or tips would be super helpful.

travel,1ju1ry8,New Orleans or Puerto Rico for a 4-7 day vacation,"My significant other and I have barely traveled and want to do more. We have an 8 day period from may 18th-may 26th on which we can travel, and there are great flight deals for Puerto Rico and New Orleans, neither of which we’ve been to. Obviously these are completely different destination types, but after doing some research, both seem like solid options and I can’t decide between the two.

As for us, we like relaxing, but also going out and doing touristy things. We’re both relatively cheap, and would want to do things somewhat on a budget. We drink, but aren’t crazy drinkers, and like good food but don’t want to pay an arm and a leg for a “foodie experience.

Looking to go in the last week of may, with potential flexibility into the first few days of June. I probably have 6-9 days (i am being serious) there. In doing a quick google search, it seems the weather will be 70-80 F during the day and 50-60 F at night, which could be really fun to do a camper van after spending some time in Lisbon. Other considerations are Porto and a trip out to the Duoro Valley, Algarve in the south, Sintra and Cascais, Nazare for the big waves, etc etc. 



Will be doing more research this week but want to hear from anyone who has been to Portugal on advice of where to go, how long to stay in Lisbon and Porto, and any recommendations that you may have for my trip! Nothing is out of the way at the moment, as well still have a lot to plan and very little time. 

  
Initial ideas are: 2-3 days in Lisbon. Rent a van, drive out to Sintra and Cascais, stop somewhere along the coast. Hit Nazare and head up to Porto 1-2 days. Dip out to the Duoro Valley for a day. drive down to Algarve for the last night. return to Lisbon and fly home.

*traveling in early June for 7-10 days
*flying in and out of Edinburgh 
*i like a loose itinerary with flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they pop up

Places we definitely want to go:
- Edinburgh (and day or two in and around the city exploring)
- Rosslyn Chapel

The Lowlands :
- my maiden name is Armstrong so we are visiting their ancestral homelands. Doesn't seem to be more than a day in that area.
- Gilnockie Castle and surrounding areas

Highlands :
-I'm thinking of using Inverness as a ""homebase"" while we spend a few days exploring the Highlands. Is there a better option?

Other ideas:
- Glencoe
- Culloden 
- Castle Stirling
- Are there other castles we need to see?
- Loch Lomand
- Loch Ness? I've seen some say to skip it?
- Train to Glenfinnan Viaduct

We love coffee shops, bookstores, game stores, and days spent in nature. We hike and camp often and don't mind walking/hiking several miles a day. We're history buffs, especially military history. We love the idea of renting a car and just driving!

If anyone can please help in answering these questions. We are from South Africa, and we planned a trip that will last 62 days in total, flights are booked and non-refundable.  
  
I was under the impression that we do not need a VISA, but then only later on realised that the fine print said, ""if your stay is less than 30 days.""  
So of course everything is a mess now, as there is physically no more time to get a VISA in time before we leave. We are leaving for the USA in 10 days. But only going to the Dominican Republic in 2 months.  
  
Does anyone know if we will be stopped from entering the country in the first place with the flight tickets that are 62 days apart? If that is not a problem, can I then just go and apply for an extension immediately for our full stay?  
If they will not allow us into the country with the flights so far apart, is it better to book a flight out within 30 days. Then go into the country. Then apply for the extension, then cancel the flight and then stay on as was planned, and take the original flight back.

I know I should’ve followed the proper process, but life has changed, and we are truly blessed now with the opportunity to travel and take a vacation. I now work as a freelancer.

Hi everyone,

I’m planning to travel to Taiwan with my child and his dad in December 2025. We’re not married, but our child is already 13 years old. My concern is about my travel history.

I traveled to Cambodia twice on a tourist visa, 7 and 8 years ago. Both times, I entered as a tourist but ended up working there. On my second trip, the immigration officer (IO) asked me if my OFW status was canceled, and I said yes because I didn’t even know I had been tagged as an OFW. I only stayed there for a short time, less than 3 months, before returning to the Philippines.

Both times, I also did visa runs to Vietnam to extend my stay. Now, I’m worried that when I travel this December, even though I’ll be with my child and his dad, I might be questioned by immigration. I’m also concerned that they might ask me for a canceled OEC, especially since I’m not sure if I was officially tagged as an OFW on my second trip.

**Disclaimer:** Please don’t judge me for my past decisions. I know I should’ve followed the proper process, but life has changed, and we are truly blessed now with the opportunity to travel and take a vacation. I now work as a freelancer.

travel,1jtb03o,Help planning a Nepal trip (16–22 June) for a group of 8 (mixed age group) — how does this itinerary sound?,"Hey everyone! I’d love some advice on planning a 7-day trip to Nepal from 16 to 22 June 2025. We’re a group of 8 people — 4 of us are in our late 20s and the other 4 are around 60, including my dad, who’s turning 60 during the trip. So we’re hoping to make it special with a mix of scenic, cultural, and nature experiences that aren’t too physically intense.

Here’s the rough itinerary I’ve come up with:

🗓️ 16 June – Arrive in Kathmandu (\~3:30 PM), stay overnight  
🗓️ 17 June – Explore Kathmandu (Swayambhunath, Patan Durbar, and a private pooja at Pashupatinath Temple to mark my dad’s 60th birthday)  
🗓️ 18 June – Fly to Pokhara, explore Lakeside and Phewa Lake  
🗓️ 19 June – Drive Pokhara → Bandipur (scenic stop + lunch) → Chitwan National Park (arrive by evening)  
🗓️ 20 June – Safari and jungle activities in Chitwan  
🗓️ 21 June – Fly back to Kathmandu, relax or light sightseeing  
🗓️ 22 June – Depart from Kathmandu

A few things I’d love your input on:

* Is Chitwan the right pick for wildlife, or should we consider another park like Bardia for this kind of group?
* Any thoughts on Bandipur as a stopover — is it worth it, or would it be better to head straight to Chitwan?
* Any tips for organizing a private pooja at Pashupatinath Temple? (We're doing this as a special part of the birthday celebration.)
* Any suggestions to make the 60th birthday extra memorable — either in Kathmandu or somewhere along the way?
* General feedback — does this itinerary feel too rushed or does it strike a good balance for a mixed-age group?

I will be visiting Bali end of May - beginning of July for 2 weeks. I started listing the places I might want to visit and build my plan. 

After reading all the travel experiences, I started doubting If It is too much for 2 weeks or still manageable. 

Here is my plan:

- 5 Days:  Uluwatu - Canngu - Seminyak
my plan is to choose one common staying location to avoid travelling with luggage.

2 Day: Nusa Penida

3 Days: Gili

2 Days : Sidemen / Karangasem

2 Days: Ubud

I can cut a day from Gili and/or Amed to Ubud.

Any recommendations?

I would like to dive at least once (Scuba) during my holiday. Amed/Gili/Nusa are the options. Any advice here?

1. My mom was born in Vietnam but immigrated to Canada back in the 80's. On her Canadian passport, it states that she was born in Vietnam. She doesn't have a Vietnamese passport. What type of Visa is she eligible for? Can she get an e-visa?
2. Are my brother and I eligible for e-visa's if we were born in Canada but our mom was born in Vietnam?
3. The e-visa asks for relatives that live in Vietnam - my dad's side of the family is in Vietnam but we haven't been in contact with them for over 16 years (my dad passed away when I was young and we lost touch). As a result, I don't know any of their names, DOB, addresses, etc. - how should I go about filling this in on the e-visa if we are eligible?

travel,1jt3067,Malaysia - convince me to go to KK or Penang instead of Langkawi,"We're planning a trip to Malaysia, 7D6N in KL and 5D4N at a beach resort. We have two kids, 5 yo and 3yo. Our requirements are pretty simple - we mostly want to relax at the resort, go into town here and there, and only a couple of outings/excursions that the kids can enjoy. We've been to Penang once (without kids) and Langkawi three times (twice with kids), and contrary to the sentiment on this and other subs we found Langkawi much more fun and relaxing. I'll say that our Penang trip was probably not well planned, we stayed at Shangri-La which was not close to Georgetown and we found our beach to be quite busy because of the amount of water sports being run nearby. In Langkawi we stayed along Cenang Beach, we weren't bothered that it was the most touristy part of the island and appreciated being walking distance from convenience stores, restaurants and local shopping. We have no experience with Kota Kinabalu, the beaches and resorts look fantastic (considering Shangri-La Rasa Ria) but the nearby activities/excursions don't seem to be little kid friendly. I'm not sure if Grab operates in Sabah, would be a bummer if not because when the kids got bored of resort food we could always order mcdonalds/kfc/burger king to the resort.

So the easy choice for us is Langkawi because it's a known quantity that the kids enjoyed a lot and there's more to do that we didn't get to in the last two trips. But we also want to try somewhere new, so either giving Penang another shot or doing something new for all of us like KK. We did consider places like Tioman and Perhentian but getting there will be torture for the kids and eat a bigger chunk out of our allotted time to travel. Am I missing any other options in Malaysia? I know people have strong opinions against Langkawi, but we wouldn't lose any sleep choosing it over other options.  Would appreciate if people with similar aged kids can share experiences in Penang and KK that would help us make our decision.

– **Hot springs in Bouillante**:

* I’m looking for a spot that isn’t too touristy, with clean, safe water. I’ve heard of natural hot springs in the area, but I’m not sure where they are exactly or if they’re still in good condition. Any specific addresses or GPS points you can share?

travel,1js5n6u,"🇨🇳 3 weeks China itinerary – too many highlights, not enough character?","Hi Reddit!

My girlfriend and I are traveling through China from October 15 to November 5. We land in Shanghai and fly home from Beijing – those are the only fixed points. Everything in between is still open.

We’ve mapped out a rough route, based mostly on popular advice, but we’re starting to wonder: are we just ticking off tourist highlights?

We want to experience the character and contrasts of China - not just the “must-see” sights.

So we’d love your thoughts. What would you keep? What would you change? We’re wide open to suggestions.

**About us**

– Couple in our early 30s  
– Big fans of city life, culture shock & contrast  
– Also love nature and calm moments  
– Prefer to travel independently (but happy to book a day tour now and then)  
– Comfortable travelers (boutique hotels / nice 4-star places)  
– Planning to go entirely by train - unless this is a bad idea (AI or Google maps isn't helping with the traveltimes)

**Rough itinerary (by train)**

**Shanghai (5 days)** \- arrival, explore the city, water town day trip  
**Zhangjiajie (5 days)** \- Avatar mountains, glass bridge, Tianmen Mountain  
**Chongqing (4 days)** \- cyberpunk skyline, hotpot, contrast  
**Xi’an (4 days)** \- Terracotta Army, city wall, Muslim quarter  
**Beijing (5 days)** \- Forbidden City, Great Wall, temples, wind down

**What we’re wondering**

1. Is this route logical and doable by train?
2. Is train travel realistic and enjoyable the whole way? Or exhausting?
3. Are we staying too long or too short anywhere?
4. Are we only seeing the touristy side of China? Any alternatives?
5. Zhangjiajie: Where to stay? And is train travel to/from there actually doable (and not horrible)?

Huge thanks in advance – we’d love to hear your real experiences, tips, or even wild alternative routes.
