music,1jr8abw,Is anyone a fan of the band Poco?,"Poco was co-founded in 1968 by Jim Messina (the same Jim Messina from Loggins and Messina), Rusty Young (for a short time a member of Buffalo Springfield and a virtuoso on the steel guitar), Richie Furay (co-founder of Buffalo Springfield and later a member of The Souther-Hillman-Furay Band and a founding father of Christian Rock), Randy Meisner (founding member of Eagles), and George Grantham. Their 1969 debut album, Pickin' Up the Pieces, is a very influential country/southern rock album (the only debut album EVER to earn a 5 star rating from Rolling Stone) which unfortunately came out around the same time as the Flying Burrito Bros. album. Meisner left after the first album and was replaced by Timothy B. Schmitt (who ironically replaced Meisner in Eagles about 8 years later), and along with the addition of singer-songwriter Paul Cotton (who wrote many of Poco's more well-known songs, including Heart of the Night), formed the classic era of the band.

Poco never had the commercial nor critical success of Eagles, but had a very similar sound. Their 1978 album *Legend* (which marked a stylistic change in the band to a more radio-friendly sound) contained two Top 20 hits, Crazy Love and Heart of the Night, both of which get decent play on 70's and oldies stations. But the band had so many other great songs. Rose of Cimarron is a beautiful Western ballad, Bad Weather is a really underrated ballad, and their comeback Top 20 song, Call It Love, is a cool modernized take on their 70's output. 

Poco has lost most of their members and officially disbanded in 2021 after the death of Rusty Young, who had been with the band throughout it's entire history (including after a couple of breakups/hiatuses) and semi-retired from the band in 2014. The only surviving original member is Richie Furay, who had appeared occasionally with the band after leaving in 1974.

Poco is a severely underrated, underappreciated band that helped pioneer country/southern rock. Their primary members during their prime are (except for Grantham and Cotton) in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for their contributions with other classic bands of the time, and they all were phenomenal musicians. I think they deserve more recognition!

Please share stories if you have any about this band and let the Poco fans take over the comment section!

But Yes is fuckin awesome and whenever I listen to them I'm wondering: how did these guys even come up with this shit? Something like Heart of the Sunrise or And You And I. Did they write music out as notes? Or did they improv practice as a band to come up with their songs and keep things, or plan the whole thing out and then practice? Did they have fun when they were practicing or was it like ""here's this complicated shit we have to execute""? 


Also love Zappa, but even his prog stuff seems more predictable, like you can see where it's going next. Pink Floyd is also kinda similar, it's genius and proggy, but you can sort of follow how it came to be.

One of the most underrated music videos of all time from arguably the most politically controversial band ever.

I will admit, for all his intensity, Zach de la Rocha's lyrics are often drowned out by his band's awesome guitar riffs and the general chaos of Rage's music.

Rage had four songs pulled from stations after 9/11, more than any other band or artist.
But read the lyrics to ""Testify"" or ""Killing in the Name"" or ""War within a Breath"" and you'll see why the band genuinely scares those in power — and why they are so relevant, and so incredible.

These guys know the media is our enemy, almost all politicians are corrupted by money and power... and that we, the people, need to fight for our freedoms before the powers that be strip us of them.

Anyway, for further giggles, I'm putting together a collection of covers, and am up to 152 version (caveat: many artists are represented with multiple versions as I decided to not worry about studio versus various live versions). The running time is up to 9 hours, 46 minutes, for whatever that information is worth.

I'm not at the end of the list (which has yet to be in sight), just taking a breather and listening what I've got so far (on random play--it seems the only fair way). This, though, has got me wondering:

music,1jxs38z,"SABLE, fABLE","SABLE, fABLE - Bon Iver

Don’t know if anyone else has jumped into this one yet but what I love is how it’s still got that classic Bon Iver ache, but it’s not stuck in the dark. Justin’s voice is front and center, confident as hell, and the collabs add just enough spice without stealing the show. It’s like he’s saying, “I’ve been through it, but I’m good now, or at least I’m trying.” Feels personal, like he’s singing to you.

Honestly, SABLE, fABLE feels like catching up with an old friend who’s been through hell but found some light. It’s hopeful, human, and so freaking beautiful. I’ve had it on repeat, and it’s got me feeling all the feels. If you’re into Bon Iver or just want something real, give it a spin. It’s worth it.

music,1jtlvt5,Rick Rubin: A Spiritual Guru or a Master Marketer?,"Rick Rubin is often hailed as a kind of mystical creative force, a barefoot oracle of minimalism and intuition, whose hands-off approach to music production is somehow seen as revolutionary. There’s no doubt he’s been involved in some powerful work, and he clearly holds a deep reverence for the creative process. But the more I look at the full picture, the more contradictions I see.

Rubin has a net worth of over $200 million. Yet, his podcast has sponsors. His online community “The Creative Act” is behind a paywall. He still charges enormous fees for production work, which, by his own account  is extremely hands-off. He often dodges questions about the business side of his work by saying things like “let’s talk about the art instead,” or “someone else can handle that.” This might sound poetic at best but at worst it’s evasive or even manipulative.

If Rubin really cared about spreading his creative philosophy, wouldn’t he make it accessible to everyone? Why not remove the paywalls, make the podcast ad-free, mentor emerging artists at affordable rates? With the financial security he has, it seems totally within reach. But instead, his wisdom, however sincere, is repackaged and monetised ruthlessly.

Take the Johnny Cash cover of Hurt. Yeah, Rubin suggested the song. It was a brilliant choice, but also a strategic one. It reintroduced Cash to Gen X and millennial audiences by tapping into a pre-existing emotional current. And while the result was haunting and powerful, it’s hard not to see the marketing logic beneath the poetry. The move wasn’t just emotionally resonant, it was commercially savvy.

Compare that to someone like Steve Albini, who was transparent about finances, kept his rates fair, refused royalties, and worked with both big names and underground artists alike. Albini never cultivated a guru persona, and yet, he arguably embodied more artistic integrity because he owned the economics of his work instead of pretending they didn’t exist.

In the end, I think sincerity and strategy can coexist, but only when there’s transparency. When creators are honest about their dual intentions (to move people and to reach them), we trust them more. When they mystify or obscure their strategy under a cloak of detachment, it starts to feel hollow, even manipulative.

So: Is Rick Rubin a wise man who made money by accident? Or is he a master of branding whose detachment is part of a very strategic performance?

Just to clarify, I don’t deny that Rubin has clear talent and wisdom, I just think he’s quite greedy with it

Woopsire had a catchy song as his intro, so I Shazamed it, found out it was a song called Colorblind by a rapper named Pasha featuring another artist named Soul Gem. Wondered if Pasha had any other music, I looked him up on SoundCloud and Spotify, guy's got a decent sized catalog and he's been an ""up and comer"" in the Norwegian rap scene. Did a few US tours. So Norwegian rap/hip-hop and Pokémon, definitely a weird combination for sure, but it led to a whole new genre of music for me, and a love for one of my favorite rappers.",28,0.72,77,2025-04-05 17:02:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1js83pw/whats_the_weirdest_way_youve_found_one_of_your/,DreamOracle42

Rather, I mean albums that are put together in a way that all the tracks flow from one to the next, the themes, moods, ideas, etc presented go together in a way that makes sense, or is cohesive, or are sensible reactions to the rest of the album. Things like that. 

Basically, albums that seem to have been written to be a complete work. And then of those, which do you think are the best of the best?

Side note: they don’t have to be concept albums, but concept albums tend to fit those criteria. 

Some examples of what I’m talking about:

Bruce Springsteen - Born to Run

Deltron 3030 - Deltron 3030

Fleetwood Mac - Rumours

Miles Davis - Birth of the Cool

Hum - You’d Prefer an Astronaut 

And the obvious:

Pink Floyd - The Wall, Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here

For me, it was “Blackstar” by David Bowie. I had always liked Bowie, but this album made me start appreciating production, tone, and even silence in songs on a whole different level.

[ALBUM REVIEW: Deafheaven - Lonely People With Power - Boolin Tunes](https://boolintunes.com/reviews/album-review-deafheaven-lonely-people-with-power/#:~:text=It%20tears%20the%20question%20of,Warm%20winds%20blow.)

Here is some of the things they said 

Overall, many will likely call ***Lonely People With Power*** a return to form. That of course depends on your perception of ***Infinite Granite***, a comparison from which this album cannot escape. However, the more apt parallel may be ***New Bermuda***, which previously was their black metal peak. These still excellent albums in their own regard sit just one shelf below ***Sunbather*** and ***Ordinary Corrupt Human Love***.

This is my most anticipated album and March 28 can't come soon enough ",24,0.82,7,2025-03-24 03:23:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1jihkae/album_review_deafheaven_lonely_people_with_power/,Opeth1988
