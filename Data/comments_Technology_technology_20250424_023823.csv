technology,1k50yk6,moewmie,Meanwhile Tesla CEO works 0 hours a day,359,2025-04-22 11:32:07,WraithTwelve
technology,1k50yk6,moez92i,Could it be that people perceive Tesla won't be around for the long term? Their once S3XY lineup has gotten stale and the CyberTruck is the physical manifestation of a school boy's Hot Wheels sketch. The fact that the CyberTruck made it to production at all speaks volumes about the leadership of the company. Its breakthrough bona fides have been seemingly replaced by the whims of  delusion and its sycophants. Throw in the recent tariffs and there is no sales team that will convince the consumer to choose Tesla over a local Chinese brand with better economy and technology. My estimate is that they will be forced to leave the Chinese market in two years and BYD will take over the manufacturing plant and possibly their charging network.,49,2025-04-22 11:51:23,Slight_Monk3314
technology,1k50yk6,moerqfm,"This is very bearish for teslur.

Chinese people don't care about American politics and all the naz1 shit he tried to pull here. If Tesla loses market share in China, it's because of insane competition from local brands. Westerners have heard of BYD, but it's honestly just one brand out of a hundred others competing neck and neck in the Chinese EV market. Each one with their insane features being launched every month in order to pull more interested customers.

Now imagine if those brands sell in the US. It'd be the death knell of Tesla.",41,2025-04-22 10:53:09,fufa_fafu
technology,1k50yk6,moebcbg,"In China, the world’s largest and most advanced electric vehicle market, Tesla‘s image has shifted from pioneering innovator to conservative player. According to data from the China Passenger Car Association, Tesla’s wholesale sales in China dropped 21.8% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2025, while retail sales remained essentially flat compared to last year.

This performance stands in stark contrast to Tesla’s main Chinese competitor, BYD, which achieved an 18.8% growth rate during the same period.

Sales staff under unprecedented pressure

Tesla salespeople, who interact most directly with consumers, are feeling the mounting pressure. Multiple Tesla sales representatives told reporters they have abandoned mid-week breaks in favor of working seven days a week, with daily shifts running from 9 AM to 10 PM – nearly 13 hours per day

The days when we didn’t need to work hard to introduce products and orders would ‘automatically’ arrive are gone forever,” said one salesperson who has decided to leave Tesla.

  
High turnover and harsh evaluation standards


The intense work environment has led to unprecedented turnover rates. At one Beijing store, the entire sales team is replaced approximately every month and a half, compared to every three months previously.

According to Tesla sales staff in Beijing, the current performance standard requires closing at least one sale daily, translating to approximately 30 vehicles monthly. However, many salespeople struggle to sell even 3-4 cars weekly, despite continuously tracking potential customer activity and persuasively promoting the vehicles.",73,2025-04-22 08:04:46,Wagamaga

technology,1k50yk6,mofb1hr,"Where entry level BYDs sell for $10k USD and entry level Teslas sell for $35k USD in China, Tesla becomes a luxury car whose key feature is being attractive because it's expensive. The market is there but it will only appeal to a niche segment of the market who have a lot of money and want to show that off.


https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veblen_good in economics, these goods that are more attractive as they get more expensive are called Veblen goods. At this point Tesla should probably whack up their prices in China and reinforce the notion that if you own a Tesla you are rich. Then it has something that BYD can't offer. 


Because otherwise as I can see it BYD is more attractive in every way! I think the BYD Seal looks more beautiful than any Tesla!

Eliot Spitzer, director of state operations for Gov. David Paterson and director of agency redesign and efficiency for Mr. Cuomo. Mr. Francis had his left arm amputated in 2012, and in an interview on Monday said that he relied on voice recognition software.

>Car rental giant Hertz has begun notifying its customers of a data breach that included their personal information and driver’s licenses.

>The rental company, which also owns the Dollar and Thrifty brands, said in notices on its website that the breach relates to a cyberattack on one of its vendors between October 2024 and December 2024.

>The stolen data varies by region, but largely includes Hertz customer names, dates of birth, contact information, driver’s licenses, payment card information, and workers’ compensation claims. Hertz said a smaller number of customers had their Social Security numbers taken in the breach, along with other government-issued identification numbers.

>Notices on Hertz’s websites disclosed the breach to customers in Australia, Canada, the European Union, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. 

>Hertz also disclosed the breach with several U.S. states, including California and Maine. Hertz said at least 3,400 customers in Maine were affected but did not list the total number of affected individuals, which is likely to be significantly higher.

Now, under the new Labour government, the U.K. hopes to expand its wind power sector even further through the massive expansion of the Rampion offshore wind farm. This is expected to help the government progress towards achieving its net-zero carbon ambitions. 

In 2023, 46.4 percent of the UK’s electricity was generated using renewable energy sources, of which wind energy contributed 61 percent. Around 39.7 percent of the U.K.’s wind energy is generated onshore and the remaining 60.3 offshore. The U.K. constructed its first commercial onshore wind farm in 1991, generating 1 GW of wind capacity. In 2024, the U.K.’s wind energy capacity increased to 30GW, double that of 2017.

technology,1k26uah,mnrny6p,"From the article: A judge in Nevada has ruled that “tower dumps”—the law enforcement practice of grabbing vast troves of private personal data from cell towers—is unconstitutional. The judge also ruled that the cops could, this one time, still use the evidence they obtained through this unconstitutional search. 

Cell towers record the location of phones near them about every seven seconds. When the cops request a tower dump, they ask a telecom for the numbers and personal information of every single phone connected to a tower during a set time period. Depending on the area, these tower dumps can return tens of thousands of numbers.

Cops have been able to sift through this data to solve crimes. But tower dumps are also a massive privacy violation that flies in the face of the Fourth Amendment, which protects people from unlawful search and seizure. When the cops get a tower dump they’re not just searching and seizing the data of a suspected criminal, they’re sifting through the information of everyone who was in the location.

A Nevada man, Cory Spurlock, is facing charges related to dealing marijuana and a murder-for-hire scheme. Cops used a tower dump to connect his cellphone with the location of some of the crimes he is accused of. Spurlock’s lawyers argued that the tower dump was an unconstitutional search and that the evidence obtained during it should not be. The cops got a warrant to conduct the tower dump but argued it wasn’t technically a “search” and therefore wasn’t subject to the Fourth Amendment.

U.S. District Juste Miranda M. Du rejected this argument, but wouldn’t suppress the evidence. “The Court finds that a tower dump is a search and the warrant law enforcement used to get it is a general warrant forbidden under the Fourth Amendment,” she said in a ruling filed on April 11. “That said, because the Court appears to be the first court within the Ninth Circuit to reach this conclusion and the good faith exception otherwise applies, the Court will not order any evidence suppressed.”",72,2025-04-18 14:54:07,chrisdh79

Formed in 1966, Tyler evolved from being a company that forged cast-iron sewer pipes to a local government technology firm, court and corporate records show.

“They were a company that bought companies and reinvented itself as a tech company,” said John Harvell, a former Tyler vice president and technology specialist.

“It’s really a pretty simple formula. Go in, buy up small companies. You don’t have to pay them a whole lot,” Harvell said. “Use their political contracts and influences. Get into the city, state, county, whatever it is, and then go from there.”

Tyler entered the world of Cook County government in the same way.

In 1998, it bought a land records tech firm, Government Records Services Inc., that already had a Cook County contract to digitize property records.",22,2025-04-06 17:30:41,penis_showing_game

So, if you got your driver license and you register your address with DMV then they already know your address and you don’t have to bring documents proving your address, you just need to prove who you are.

>At stake is the future Meta's enormous advertising business and the prospect of having to spin off its hugely popular services into separate companies.
>
>...
>
>The FTC argues that when Meta acquired Instagram, in 2012, and WhatsApp, two years later, that it was part of a strategy to eliminate competition and maintain monopoly power over the social media market. The government contends that a ""buy or bury"" strategy propelled Meta's acquisitions, leading Meta to gobble up competitors it viewed as threats, or to squash the rivals out of business altogether. The FTC says this alleged behavior is illegal under federal antitrust laws.
>
>The government argues the only way to restore competition to the social media marketplace is for Meta to be forced to unwind its purchase of both Instagram and WhatsApp. The government says divesting those apps will allow smaller social media companies compete for consumers and ad dollars and loosen Meta's grip on the industry.
>
>Meta counters that it is being punished for being an innovative and aggressive tech company. It has always competed fairly, Meta's lawyers say, and regulators are attempting to punish the tech titan's runaway success. Lawyers for Meta have also said in court filings that the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp were approved by regulators more than a decade ago, saying to revisit those decisions now is wrongheaded.
>
>Yet the FTC maintains that Meta was not forthcoming to regulators who cleared the purchases, claiming Meta withheld key information about the company to win the blessing of Washington. Another important facet to Meta's defense is just how different the social media ecosystem is today, versus 2012 and 2014, when the company made those purchases.
>
>...
>
>Regulators also say Meta's privacy protections have lapsed as a result of its alleged monopoly status. To the FTC, a break-up would mean better social media apps for all of us. But Meta says the opposite: That a breakup would make each of its individual apps less integrated and worse for consumers.

>Like many other executives in Silicon Valley, Zuckerberg has recently been ingratiating himself with the Trump administration.

>Zuckerberg has also made several visits to Trump's Mar-a-Lago club. There has been speculation that Trump could abandon the trial and settle with Meta but so far, all indications point to the case unfolding for many weeks. 

With the venal capriciousness of this current administration, it's more difficult than usual to ascertain what direction this case might be moving in over the coming weeks.

There is this entrenched belief that the internet should remain this free place, without borders. The truth, as many people have started to realized, is that a *completely unregulated* internet and media environment is pure discordance and chaos. No one on earth ever envisioned that we’d be in a place where any single human, could shout into the internet and be heard by billions, and now have AI to help pump out millions of messages an hour. The result is what I call Information Chaos. And it’s causing us serious damage as a society in a number of ways. I’d also differentiate between the “networked Internet” (which allows like, sending emails), and the “social internet” (the UI which we interact on a daily basis). These thoughts primarily apply to the social internet. 

First, is that our adversaries (China, Russia, Iran) have walled themselves off from the rest of us, and can now freely throw stones and garbage over the walls into our yard, because we choose not to regulate ourselves; but don’t allow it back. Their internet is highly orderly (and heavily policed, censored, controlled, etc.), while ours is total anarchy.

Second, the ability be heard by the world gives everyone a false impression that they also DESERVE to be listened to. Let me be clear, not everyone’s opinions matter on every topic. This imho has contributed greatly to our decline in trust of institutions, news, and experts.

Flanked by two bodyguards, Meta’s CEO solemnly strode into a Washington, DC courtroom. Despite his last-ditch efforts to avoid a trial, he was there, jaw clenched, to defend his company from being broken up by the US government.

Shortly after he was sworn in, the Federal Trade Commission’s lead attorney for the case, Daniel Matheson, asked Zuckerberg to reflect back on when Facebook was the underdog.

“In hindsight, you’re glad you didn’t sell to MySpace?” Matheson asked.

“Yes,” Zuckerberg responded.

Over the next several hours of questioning, Matheson walked Zuckerberg down memory lane to the period just before Facebook’s $1 billion acquisition of Instagram in 2012, which the FTC claims was the first in a series of anti-competitive steps that locked out other companies. In a lawsuit that was initially filed five years ago and went to trial this week, the agency argues that Meta should be forced to spin off both Instagram and WhatsApp, which it later acquired for roughly $19 billion in 2014.

technology,1k4ezth,mo9gqw4,"From the article: As I reported just last week, cheap-yet-awesome retro handhelds are being marched to the guillotine in the name of Trump tariffs. One of the first companies to have its head on the block is also one of the most prolific. Handheld maker Anbernic told customers Sunday that it would stop all direct shipments to U.S. customers, at least until President Donny finally offers any clarity on how much people will pay in import duties for products from China.

Anbernic is known for its enormous library of handheld video game emulation hardware. These handhelds are able to use console emulators—essentially full video game consoles translated into software—to play new homebrew titles as well as digital copies of older games, known as ROMS. In a page describing the new shipping policy, Anbernic said “due to changes in U.S. tariff policies, we will be suspending all shipping from China to the United States starting today. We strongly recommend prioritizing products shipped from our U.S. warehouse.”

Until today Anbernic let customers ship products either directly from China or from it’s U.S. warehouse, where supplies were more limited but products would ship out faster. It’s unclear how long the current supply of consoles in the U.S. will last. I reached out to Anbernic for comment, but did not immediately hear back. The handheld maker said it would update customers when it received “confirmed updates regarding import duties.”

Fortunately there’s more than one way to get a console from Anbernic. You might still be able to find its products on Amazon, or AliExpress. The dropshipping site typically sells these handhelds for much cheaper than you could get elsewhere, too. The classic Anbernic RG35XX Plus Game Boy-like device goes for $48 on AliExpress, $50 on the Anbernic site, and a whopping $80 on Amazon. As American supplies dwindle we can assume those prices will increase.",75,2025-04-21 14:33:59,chrisdh79

So I was watching a depression food recipe YouTube and they were talking about Hoover stew. This is my new hobby.. Watching depression era cooking on YouTube.

Anyway one of the featured recipes was called Hoover stew. It was called this because  Hoover was widely blamed for the 1930s economic depression. Further research lead me to something called the smoot Hawley tariff act. I didn't know anything about this so it was interesting to learn about and it is easy to see how it is applicable here. 

Except in Hoover's case I don't think he was trying to purposefully bankrupt the American people to hand over the country to the tech bros.. in trump's case he seems to be doing it to ""show"" he's protecting American interests but in reality it was already good and now it's garbage. Anyway.. Here is a brief summary of the act.

The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, officially the Tariff Act of 1930, was a U.S. law enacted on June 17, 1930, that significantly raised import duties on over 20,000 foreign goods. It was championed by Senator Reed Smoot and Representative Willis C. Hawley, with the primary goal of protecting American farmers and industries from foreign competition during the onset of the Great Depression.

Here are the key facts about the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act:
 * Protectionist Measure: Its main aim was to shield domestic producers by making imported goods more expensive.

 * High Tariff Rates: The act increased tariffs to some of the highest levels in U.S. history, averaging around a 20% increase on dutiable imports. Some tariffs were raised as high as 50%.

 * Wide Scope: It applied to a vast range of goods, both agricultural and manufactured.

 * Triggered Retaliation: A major consequence was that many foreign countries retaliated by imposing their own tariffs on American exports.

 * Contributed to Trade Decline: This trade war led to a dramatic decline in international trade. U.S. exports and imports both plummeted by significant amounts. Global trade decreased by an estimated 65% between 1929 and 1934.

 * Worsened the Great Depression: While the Act didn't cause the Great Depression, most economists agree that it significantly worsened its severity and prolonged the economic downturn both in the U.S. and globally. It reduced demand for goods, led to business closures, and exacerbated unemployment.

 * Nearly Unanimous Opposition from Economists: Over 1,000 economists signed a petition urging President Hoover to veto the bill, warning of its negative economic consequences.

 * Political Motivations: Despite the economic warnings, political pressure from various domestic industries seeking protection led to its passage.

 * A Symbol of Protectionism: The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act has become a lasting symbol of the dangers of protectionist trade policies and is often cited as an example of how tariffs can backfire.

 * Shift Towards Free Trade: In the years following the Great Depression, the U.S. shifted towards policies of trade liberalization, beginning with the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934.

In essence, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 was a protectionist measure intended to help American industries but ultimately contributed to a global trade war and deepened the economic crisis of the Great Depression.",8,2025-04-21 15:55:00,J-W-L

Took a while to figure out why they're doing things they way they are

So concentrating solar is kind of expensive and a bit klunky these days right? So it's sort of fallen out of favor for panels. But it looks like electrical efficiency may not be the point. Reading one of their papers (Methane dry reforming via a ceria-based redox cycle in a concentrating solar tower) they're running the first stage of the reaction right in the focus point(the creation of the syngas)

Looking at the article they have traditional panels and power storage now too so I wonder if they're playing to see if it's now scaling better to just heat up rather then heat directly(plus storage so they can run constantly of course since the reaction is more efficient if it can just keep going)

The only real thing I couldn't find anywhere is what the cost of their current product is. They're open about what they're hoping to scale up for in the future but nothing about what it's at now. I know it's not exactly at big production right now so it's not that important for the layman but it's always nice to know how things are going. I'd also like to know exactly what they're making not what they *can* make. I'm pretty sure they're making some form of Sustainable Aviation Fuel(lot's of sponsors in that field too) but I don't know what kind. Looking around apparently that comes in all kinds of flavors plus they say they *can* produce any carbon chain so they should be able to make the real fuel too(but how economically, and if they *are* I'm not sure)

Still, it's really neat, and for the little I could understand they have some interesting papers too",14,2025-04-21 14:48:47,Mr_ToDo

*[...] Many on the DOGE team are from Musk’s world. If Musk is America’s CEO, then DOGE has become his Silicon Valley executive branch.*

*We’ve mapped out a non-exhaustive list of people affiliated with DOGE, including creating a searchable table with each member, their corporate history, and the agencies they’ve been connected to. Readers can check that out, and click through it, below.*

*We plan to keep updating this as we find more DOGE operatives or as known affiliates move to new agencies.*

*[...] The DOGE world, as it stands, seems to break down into roughly three categories: former Trump officials, conservative lawyers, and imports from the Silicon Valley area (funders, founders, technologists, or people connected to them).*

*In that first category we find people like DOGE spokesperson Katie Miller, the wife of White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller. The two of them have been Musk’s guides to DC.*

*In that second category are people like James Burnham and Austin Raynor, both former clerks for conservative Supreme Court justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas, respectively. Jacob Altik, another conservative lawyer on the DOGE squad, has been selected to clerk for Gorsuch.*

*Jeremy Lewin, who was part of DOGE’s dismantling of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), worked with Second Lady Usha Vance’s former law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson, a firm that has also represented Tesla.*

*Then, the biggest throughline of all: Of those Silicon Valley imports, one of the most clear themes across DOGE’s ranks is fairly obvious: a connection to Elon Musk. Forty-nine people on our list have connections to Musk, his companies, or his greater network. This connection is most often through one of his allies or one of his companies.*

*[...] More than any other company, SpaceX has significant representation in DOGE, with 16 of the 80 listed DOGE operatives having worked there in some capacity.*

  2. Make sure we don't piss off the only fabricators of high end photolithography machines by continuing good relations with the EU. 
  3. Make sure our existing relationships with Taiwan stay stable, lest they be invaded by China and have their tech acquired by our adversaries. 
  4. Ensure top-tier talent is retained by funding university research. 
  5. Preserve our status of preferred trade partner with our historical allies. Definitely don't threaten them by withdrawing alliances, stomping on treaties, invading them arbitrarily, and imposing stupid tariffs which will ensure they start to set up preferential trade agreements with our more stable adversaries. 
  5. Ensure foreign talent is attracted via a friendly visa program and welcoming environment for foreign knowledge workers. 
  6. Secure next generation onshore STEM talent and international competitiveness, by raising the standards of math and science in K-12. 
  7. Invest in battery tech and renewables which will obviously be the foundation of EVs, data centers, robotics lines, autonomous defence systems etc. 
8. Invest in the grid in anticipation of greater demand, and to ensure redundancy and node isolation in the event of infra attack by foreign adversaries.

A stolen keycard or phone would be useless for stealing the car. The only way to steal a Tesla with PIN to Drive enabled is to bring a flatbed truck, or use violence to coerce the owner to give up the code - scenarios which are quite rare given how most professional car thieves want to stealthily take off with the car in less than 2 minutes.

We don’t know what the next costume’s going to be, but it will be something different. It’s whatever gets him closest to power.”

>
>In a statement, Meta spokesperson Ryan Daniels called Wynn-Williams’ testimony “divorced from reality and riddled with false claims. While Mark Zuckerberg himself was public about our interest in offering our services in China and details were widely reported beginning over a decade ago, the fact is this: we do not operate our services in China today.”
>
>Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) said she found it “ironic” that China was a focus of the hearing, given that when she tried to pass a tech antitrust bill, “one of the things that kept being thrown in my face and in those of others that work on this, is that ‘you’re actually going to destroy us and then China will dominate,’” she said. “Your book actually reveals the extent to which Facebook was willing to put growth over the US national interest to gain favor with the Chinese Communist Party.”
>
>Lawmakers dared Zuckerberg to testify before their committee himself to clear up their issues with her statements. “Stop trying to silence her, stop trying to gag her, stop trying to hide behind your lawyers and millions of dollars in legal fees you’re trying to impose on her,” said Hawley. “Come to this committee, take the oath, sit there, let us question you, and give the American people the truth. We will be waiting for you.”

technology,1k2tnf5,mnwq1g1,"Article:

The semiconductor industry has lobbied two presidential administrations to go easy with restrictions on selling cutting-edge computer chips to China. Jensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia, the world’s leading artificial intelligence chip maker, even traveled to Mar-a-Lago this month to discuss policy with President Trump.

But with the Trump administration putting new curbs on A.I. chip sales this week, it is clear that the industry’s pushback has failed. The fallout has set off a scramble among chipmakers to reset expectations for a future with less sales to China and prompted fears that their retreat could turn the Chinese tech giant Huawei into a global chip-making powerhouse.

The Trump administration said on Tuesday it was taking measures to restrict the sale of A.I. chips by Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices and Intel. The crackdown essentially closed the door on a fast-growing business in China, which buys more chips than any other country in the world.

In the two days after the limits became public, shares of Nvidia, the world’s leading A.I. chipmaker, fell 8.4 percent. AMD’s shares dropped 7.4 percent, and Intel’s was down 6.8 percent.

“For the U.S. semiconductor industry, China is gone,” said Handel Jones, a semiconductor consultant at International Business Strategies, which advises electronics companies. He projects that Chinese companies will have a majority share of chips in every major category in China by 2030.

The U.S. companies’ challenges are a reflection of how U.S.-China tensions are reordering the global economy. For years, U.S. companies created and designed many of the world’s best-selling products, while relying on China to produce most of them and buy many of them.

But over the past decade, the balance shifted as China began to develop homegrown rivals and Mr. Trump began imposing tariffs. A.I. has heightened those tensions. The technology has the potential to create trillions of dollars in economic value and funnel tremendous power to the two countries vying for A.I. supremacy: the United States and China.

Computer chips are the building blocks of artificial intelligence. Nvidia, in particular, dominates the market for chips used to build A.I. systems. It was on the verge of becoming the first publicly traded company worth $4 trillion before a stock swoon over the past few months dropped its value below $2.5 trillion.

In 2022, the Biden administration started imposing rules to restrict China’s ability to buy Nvidia A.I. chips. The administration added more limits each subsequent year. Then, this week the Trump administration blocked the last A.I. chip that Nvidia was selling to China, the H20, saying it was in the government’s national and economic security interest.

The timing couldn’t have been worse for Nvidia. Mr. Huang had a scheduled trip to China this week. He spent Thursday with Chinese leaders, stressing how important the country was to his business.

“We’re going to continue to make significant effort to optimize our products that are compliant within the regulations and continue to serve China’s market,” Mr. Huang said during a meeting with the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade.
Mr. Huang’s message spoke to one of his biggest fears. 

For years, he has worried that Huawei, China’s telecommunications giant, will become a major competitor in A.I. He has warned U.S. officials that blocking U.S. companies from competing in China would accelerate Huawei’s rise, said three people familiar with those meetings who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

If Huawei gains ground, he and others at Nvidia have painted a dark picture of a future where China will use the company’s chips to build A.I. data centers across the world for the Belt and Road Initiative, a strategic effort to increase Beijing’s influence by paying for infrastructure projects around the world, a person familiar with the company’s thinking said.

Huawei has entered and conquered other markets. Over the years, it has surpassed Ericsson and Nokia in telecommunications and took on Apple in smartphones.
But the company’s semiconductor business faces challenges. Washington has blocked China from making chips in Taiwan, which produces the world’s most powerful semiconductors. It also prevents Chinese companies from buying machines made by ASML, the Dutch company whose machines are essential for manufacturing the most advanced semiconductors.

Nvidia’s previous generation of chips perform about 40 percent better than Huawei’s best product, said Gregory C. Allen, who has written about Huawei in his role as director of the Wadhwani A.I. Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

But that gap could dwindle if Huawei scoops up the business of its American rivals, Mr. Allen said. Nvidia was expected to make more than $16 billion in sales this year from the H20 in China before the restriction. Huawei could use that money to hire more experienced engineers and make higher-quality chips.

Mr. Allen said that the U.S. government’s restrictions also could help Huawei bring on customers like DeepSeek, a leading Chinese A.I. start-up. Working with those companies could help Huawei improve the software it develops to control its chips. Those kinds of tools have been one of Nvidia’s strengths over the years.

Huawei didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

To prevent Huawei from gaining ground, Dylan Patel, chief analyst for the research firm SemiAnalysis, who closely follows the rise of A.I. technologies, said U.S. officials must prevent China from buying American chip-making equipment.

The U.S. government allows some Chinese companies to buy American machinery. Chinese companies have exploited that loophole, Mr. Patel said. His firm has reported that approved companies have bought equipment and transferred it to Chinese companies that have been blocked from buying it.

“Huawei is a ferocious competitor,” Mr. Allen said. “It brings a mixture of very high quality talent, psychotically driven work culture and the deep backing of the Chinese government.”",15,2025-04-19 11:02:07,DifusDofus

>As it flew up toward the International Space Station last summer, the Starliner spacecraft lost four thrusters. A NASA astronaut, Butch Wilmore, had to take manual control of the vehicle. But as its thrusters failed, Wilmore lost the ability to move Starliner in the direction he wanted to go.
>
>He and his fellow astronaut, Suni Williams, knew where they wanted to go. Starliner had flown to within a stone's throw of the space station, a safe harbor if only they could reach it. But already, the failure of so many thrusters violated the mission's flight rules. In such an instance, they were supposed to turn around and come back to Earth. Approaching the station was deemed too risky for Wilmore and Williams, aboard Starliner, as well as the astronauts on the $100 billion space station.
>
>But what if it was not safe to come home, either?
>
>""I don't know that we can come back to Earth at that point,"" Wilmore said in an interview. ""I don't know if we can. And matter of fact, I'm thinking we probably can't.""
>
>On Monday, for the first time since they returned to Earth on a Crew Dragon vehicle two weeks ago, Wilmore and Williams participated in a news conference at Johnson Space Center in Houston. Afterward, they spent hours conducting short, 10-minute interviews with reporters from around the world, describing their mission. I spoke with both.

This was a fascinating interview that looked at the circumstances around the launch of this craft, and how the astronauts and ground crew were able to get them to the space station despite numerous thruster failures. It speaks to the importance of training, and of expertise, and of testing. Well worth a detailed read for those interested in these topics.",482,2025-04-01 19:08:59,Hrmbee

2. Police can run anyone's plate for absolutely no reason, due to them being in plain view.

3. These systems (specifically Flock) require the user to have a specific login and user identifier. Along with the reasons for the plate to be queried.

4. I have higher concerns about private tow companies that mount cameras on tow trucks and run plates in Walmart parking lots.

5. There's going to be an ASS LOAD of case law about these systems in the next 5-10 years. Much of it warranted. That being said, given points 1 and 2, I don't see it being a legitimate privacy issue any more than security cameras in a public place or private business.

technology,1jo9zwv,mkr2k8k,"I have access to Flock and use it every so often. It definitely has the ability to be used for nefarious purposes, just like any other technology. But it also has a lot of limitations. Certain letters and numbers will confuse the camera, and it reads it as a different plate number. It might see a Y as a V, or an 8 as a B. At night, the vehicle color can be difficult to figure out. In my state, we don't have front license plates, so you can't see the driver of the vehicle. When I do searches, I usually either get nothing or a lot of false positives. Which leads to hours of just going through lots of photos. 

In the end, it's just a way to get a lead on a case. While I may get a picture of the vehicle near a crime scene, I still have to prove who was driving or in the vehicle and why they were in the area. A decent defense attorney can cut through this fairly easily. 

The big benefit is finding stolen vehicles. You can be alerted if they are in the area. You can also geofence a vehicle so you get an alert if they enter a certain area. It's limited to the number of cameras, though.

While there is the concern of constant surveillance, people forget that they usually run around with a very good tracking device in their pocket.

For most purposes, this is functionally the same as transferring the IPs(except ofc royalties), but in a future where Tencent might one day come to own 100% of the new subsidiary, they still wouldn't be able to hand out new licenses or really treat the IP in any way dissalowed by the license granted to the subsidiary, they would need to get their hands on Ubisoft the parent company to do that.

And to that effect, Tencent is by the contract BARRED from obtaining any more ownership in the subsidiary for a period of 5 years, unless Ubisoft is no longer majority owner before the 5 year period is up, and for a 2 year period, Ubisoft cannot cease to hold majority voting rights and share capital in the new subsidiary.  

It's literally purely a financial tool, and if Ubisoft manages to right the ship and make some money within 5 years, Tencent will not come to control the IP at all.",3,2025-03-28 16:19:43,lalalu2009

technology,1jvyq7e,mme24od,"From the article: Job cuts at the US traffic safety regulator instigated by Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency disproportionately hit staff assessing self-driving risks, hampering oversight of technology on which the world’s richest man has staked the future of Tesla.

Of roughly 30 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration workers dismissed in February as part of Musk’s campaign to shrink the federal workforce, many were in the “office of vehicle automation safety,” people familiar with the situation told the Financial Times.

The cuts are part of mass firings by Doge that have affected at least 20,000 federal employees and raised widespread concern over potential conflicts of interest for Musk given many of the targeted agencies regulate or have contracts with his businesses.

The NHTSA, which has been a thorn in Tesla’s side for years, has eight active investigations into the company after receiving—and publishing—more than 10,000 complaints from members of the public.

Morale at the agency, which has ordered dozens of Tesla recalls and delayed the rollout of the group’s self-driving and driver-assistance software, has plunged following Doge’s opening salvo of job cuts, according to current and former NHTSA staff.

“There is a clear conflict of interest in allowing someone with a business interest influence over appointments and policy at the agency regulating them,” said one former senior NHTSA figure, who was not among the Doge-led layoffs.",43,2025-04-10 14:06:07,chrisdh79

technology,1jjhiep,mjn12ba,"From the article: Europe's Consumer Protection Cooperation Network (CPCN) has initiated an enforcement action with the European Commission (EC) to reign in the predatory monetization of a gaming company called Star Stable Entertainment, maker of the MMORPG/horse simulation ""Star Stable Online."" The CPCN aims to force the developer to be more transparent about the actual costs of in-game purchases. It's asking for a soft ban on in-game currency since no formal laws explicitly prohibit it.

Like many other game companies, Star Stable obfuscates the actual cost of in-game products by listing them in the game's virtual currency, ""star coins."" The problem is that star coins aren't a one-to-one conversion to euros. In fact, this monetization model intentionally makes currency conversion practically impossible. It does this through bundled coin packages sold at a ""discount."" Star Stable Online's target demographic is young players, but even adults would have difficulty confirming exactly how much a purchase costs them.

The CPCN's action stems from a Swedish Consumers' Association complaint. After investigating, the CPCN noted several areas that appear predatory, especially toward children. These include:

*Direct appeals to children in the advertisements, urging them to buy, or persuade adults to buy for them, in-game currency or items.*

*The use of pressuring techniques such as 'purchase through time-limited practices' to unduly influence children to purchase in-game virtual currency or in-game content.*

*A lack of clear and transparent information, adapted to children, about buying and using in-game virtual currency, leading consumers to spend more than they intend to.*

*Failure by the company to ensure that the influencers promoting their products clearly disclose commercial content and do not unduly influence children with their marketing techniques.*

These marketing gimmicks are relatively common and work just as well against adults as with children. The sole difference is that adults spend their money (or credit) instead of their parents' funds. Both organizations are asking the company to be more transparent about the commercial purchases children may encounter in the game.",12,2025-03-25 11:52:26,chrisdh79

edit:

I think also specifically in regards to Cult of the Lambs DLC being such a strong seller it pairs up with what the gaming industry has been seeing since around 2018/2019 which is that gamers have comfort games, just as there are comfort watches with TV (typically rewatching sitcoms), and they stick with their comfort games.

People that really got into one live service style title/franchise have tended to stick to it which makes it very precarious to launch new live services. Sometimes they have successes such as with Helldivers 2 (which did do something different) and sometimes they crash and burn spectacularly as with the internets favorite punching bag Concord (which was familiar and bland).

If you don't have something fresh it will usually be a struggle to pull players away from their existing comfort game, something you'd have thought the games industry would have learnt after spending a decade trying to make World of Warcraft clones. Even the best recent examples of a success are Marvel Rivals and Deadlock but Overwatch has been mismanaged to the point that fans of hero shooters wanted an alternative so they opened up the floor to new competition.",5,2025-04-21 11:09:48,chipmunk_supervisor

Bethesda used to have that blanket trust and then decimated it, CD project red had it, destroyed a lot of it and then built it back up again over time, although people are still nervous about it. 

But this can also go in reverse, sometimes a company is good at making a specific IP, but they suck at releasing others and the company as a whole has a terrible reputation, but their handling of certain IP's is good and the IP itself does have a fan base, like assassin's creed and Ubisoft. 

Basically, there's no individual smoking gun of what will or won't draw people to your game. Just differing levels of exposure and trust, either on your IP's or your company.",3,2025-04-21 14:48:19,Silverlisk

My org has literally hundreds of petabytes of data on modern tape, and replacing all that infrastructure with disk would cost an exorbitant amount for no real gain whatsoever (and plenty of loss)

One of the most cost effective strategies at scale is tiered storage. Keep new, or hot (frequently accessed) data on expensive but very fast SSD, medium term working data on disk, archived or cold data on cheap but abundant tape.

Any data processing that uses archived data is staged from tape to disk, which adds latency, but it really doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things at this scale.

Not to mention if you are keeping a second copy of everything as a backup (you should have a backup), you're going to be putting it on tape anyway. Nobody is operating exascale backups to spinning disk.

Also, saving 1m per year is fucking NOTHING when you are talking data storage. Like yay we saved 1m by not buying tapes, instead we spent 10m on the equivalent disk infrastructure. Fucking stupid",8,2025-04-07 20:18:39,Ninja_Wrangler

technology,1k36g8c,mnzmmuy,"From the article: Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is planning to bring together data from a wide variety of other U.S. government agencies, including the Department of Labor (DOL), Health and Human Services (HHS), Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to make a centralized database to identify immigration targets, according to a document viewed by 404 Media.

The news signals ICE’s heavy emphasis on bringing disparate datasets together in order to carry out President Trump’s mass deportation effort. The tool, called ATrac and “Alien Tracker” in the document, is planned to allow for the management of all enforcement priorities, and provide near real-time tracking of both targets on a local level and the broader set of immigration enforcement targets around the country.

The document says ATrac is an ICE tool that displays information on a geospatial interface for officials to identify potential enforcement targets, and then task that enforcement to a particular team. Once a team is sent out, they are required to report the ultimate outcome, such as the target being arrested; the target being located but not arrested; or the target not being located.

The document says ATrac already includes information from the Social Security Administration (SSA) and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). It also includes data from law enforcement agencies such as the FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), and the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS), according to the document.

Other agencies planned for inclusion named in the document, such as HUD, HHS, and DOL, are not ordinarily associated with immigration enforcement. Earlier this month the IRS said it would provide data to ICE for immigration enforcement efforts.

technology,1k2uysd,mnxgud5,"Why are people rooting for the government to decide what kids can and can’t access? There are currently proposed legislations that would allow things like the state AG to determine if something is potentially “harmful” to kids, and restrict access without proof of age. 

And things that some state AG’s would restrict and consider “harmful” to kids ? Info about reproductive care, safe sex, (cause teens get curious and do it. Might as well give them options to be safe!!) anything to do with LGBTQ, (some queer kids have only survived into adulthood because they had secret friends online who helped through living with hateful parents) mental health information (a lot of parents don’t take their kid’s mental health seriously until it’s too late). This and other things could be and would be labeled as “distressing.” 

There is also legislation looking at repealing Section 230. 

Look, I’m not disagreeing with the fact that kids are seeing stuff they should not be seeing, and need to get offline. It enrages me that “iPad kid” is even a term. But the government stepping in for any of that is a dangerous and slippery slope to fill censorship. 

I think we need to turn attention to WHY parents aren’t able to parent- obviously not in all cases, but I wager to bet being overworked and underpaid doesn’t leave much energy to entertain your kids or monitor what they do. Give em the iPad, and you can take a break. Plus Karen’s calling the cops when a kid is outside playing alone for more than .0001 seconds doesn’t help.

technology,1jrjb6k,mlf3uzc,"From the article: When Francesca Mani was 14 years old, boys at her New Jersey high school used nudify apps to target her and other girls. At the time, adults did not seem to take the harassment seriously, telling her to move on after she demanded more severe consequences than just a single boy's one or two-day suspension.

Mani refused to take adults' advice, going over their heads to lawmakers who were more sensitive to her demands. And now, she's won her fight to criminalize deepfakes. On Wednesday, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy signed a law that he said would help victims ""take a stand against deceptive and dangerous deepfakes"" by making it a crime to create or share fake AI nudes of minors or non-consenting adults—as well as deepfakes seeking to meddle with elections or damage any individuals' or corporations' reputations.

Under the law, victims targeted by nudify apps like Mani can sue bad actors, collecting up to $1,000 per harmful image created either knowingly or recklessly. New Jersey hopes these ""more severe consequences"" will deter kids and adults from creating harmful images, as well as emphasize to schools—whose lax response to fake nudes has been heavily criticized—that AI-generated nude images depicting minors are illegal and must be taken seriously and reported to police. It imposes a maximum fine of $30,000 on anyone creating or sharing deepfakes for malicious purposes, as well as possible punitive damages if a victim can prove that images were created in willful defiance of the law.

Ars could not reach Mani for comment, but she celebrated the win in the governor's press release, saying, ""This victory belongs to every woman and teenager told nothing could be done, that it was impossible, and to just move on. It’s proof that with the right support, we can create change together.""",183,2025-04-04 18:46:13,chrisdh79

[18 U.S.C. § 2252A](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2252A) establishes the federal criminal prohibitions regarding child pornography. The statute makes it illegal to produce, distribute, receive, or possess any visual depiction—whether a photograph, film, video, picture, or computer-generated image—that depicts, or appears to depict, a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct. The statute covers not only images created with real minors but also, under certain circumstances, computer-generated or manipulated images that are indistinguishable from those of real minors. Criminal penalties under this section can be severe.

Sooo… Based on this language, if deepfake nudes are created using pictures of actual children (such that the resulting images appear indistinguishable from real images of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct) wouldn’t they fall within the scope of § 2252A and be illegal?

There’s no plagiarism, source match, or copied content. Just a high “AI-generated” percentage. That score alone was used to open an academic integrity case that could delay my degree.

What’s especially difficult is that I’m neurodivergent. My writing is structured and a bit different, and I believe that’s what flagged me. These tools aren’t built to understand communication differences, but they’re being treated like objective truth.

I didn’t receive any notification until 10 days after submitting the assignment, and I later found out Turnitin had system outages during the submission window. That makes me question how reliable any of this is.

I can personally attest to this. Just for kicks, last year I ran some papers I wrote years ago through a few of these detection engines and the results were all over the place. Usually, my papers landed somewhere between the low 30s and high 60s of “likely to be written by AI.”

The problem there is, they were all written well before LLMs even existed. 

So why are universities using them as the end all be all to catching students cheating?

IMO, the genie has been out of the bottle and there’s no going back. Schools need to either figure out how students can demonstrate proficiency without long form writing, or explicitly allow it and make students demonstrate proficiency in getting these AI tools to the “right” answer.

>A new report from ProPublica published Thursday showed how the Louisiana government is using TIGER (Targeted Interventions to Greater Enhance Re-entry), a computer program developed by Louisiana State University to prevent recidivism, to approve or deny parole applications based on a score calculating their risk of returning to prison. Though the algorithm was initially designed to be used as a tool to help rehabilitate inmates by taking their background into account, a TIGER score – which uses data from an inmate’s time before prison, such as work history, criminal convictions, and age at first arrest – is now the sole measure of one’s eligibility.
>
>In interviews, several prisoners revealed that their scheduled parole hearings had been abruptly canceled after their TIGER score determined that they were at “moderate risk” of returning to prison. There is no factor in a TIGER score that takes into account an inmate’s behavior in prison or attempts at rehab – a score that criminal justice activists argue penalizes one’s racial and demographic background. (According to current state Department of Corrections data, half of Louisiana’s prison population of roughly 13,000 would automatically fall in the moderate or high risk categories.)
>
>One included Calvin Alexander, a 70-year-old partially blind man in a wheelchair, who had been in prison for 20 years, but had spent his time in drug rehab, anger management therapy, and professional skills development, and had a clean disciplinary record. “People in jail have … lost hope in being able to do anything to reduce their time,” he told ProPublica.
>
>Parole via algorithm is not just legal in Louisiana, but a deliberate element in Republican Governor Jeff Landry’s crusade against parole. 

Given how wrong so many algorithms are, having them automatically do something as critical as determining someone's parole eligibility based on problematic criteria and data is guaranteed to result in problems. Having a human review all of these cases should be the norm, and yet states like LA are misusing this system to justify continued incarceration for more and more people.

technology,1jtwwo9,mlxlyuj,"Short wrap-up:
>On Monday, biotech company Colossal announced what it views as its first successful de-extinction: the dire wolf. These large predators were lost during the Late Pleistocene extinctions that eliminated many large land mammals from the Americas near the end of the most recent glaciation. Now, in a coordinated PR blitz, the company is claiming that clones of gray wolves with lightly edited genomes have essentially brought the dire wolf back. (Both Time and The New Yorker were given exclusive access to the animals ahead of the announcement.)

>The dire wolf is a relative of the now-common gray wolf, with clear differences apparent between the two species' skeletons. Based on the sequence of two new dire wolf genomes, the researchers at Colossal conclude that dire wolves formed a distinct branch within the canids over 2.5 million years ago. For context, that's over twice as long as brown and polar bears are estimated to have been distinct species. Dire wolves are also large, typically the size of the largest gray wolf populations. Comparisons between the new genomes and those of other canids show that the dire wolf also had a light-colored coat.

>That large of an evolutionary separation means there are likely a lot of genetic differences between the gray and dire wolves. Colossal's internal and unpublished analysis suggested that key differences could be made by editing 14 different areas of the genome, with 20 total edits required. The new animals are reported to have had 15 variants engineered in. It's unclear what accounts for the difference, and a Colossal spokesperson told Ars: ""We are not revealing all of the edits that we made at this point.""",16,2025-04-07 21:42:27,ControlCAD

The west outsourced the strategic silicon industry, and TSMC has a current near monopoly on top silicon, for which there is no near term alternative.

China threatens to annex Taiwan, and it's looking increasingly likely China will annex Taiwan without firing a single shot by just blockading the island. With how much the USA is damaging it's strategic alliances required for the USA to even have a chance at stopping China.

If they are using the same engine that produces regular answers, to report the details of circuit tracing, why should we expect it to be any different than the regular answers? 

To get it to explain circuit tracing, you have to generate a circuit tracing log, and then run a simple log reader, with no other inputs / linkages / concepts / LLM processing / etc. (Using the LLM engine to read / explain a circuit tracing log is not debugging, it is another program module doing bullshit.)

You know, like debugging a regular program.

EDIT2:

An insightful comment about the nature of AI and how we fail to understand it's value:

https://www.techspot.com/news/107347-finally-beginning-understand-how-llms-work-no-they.html#comment_13

> There is nothing particularly comforting about it. **AI has a very strong synthetic-qualitative-logical-emergent intelligence whereas most humans have analytical-quantitive-logical-discrete intelligence. Lack of analytical skills comes from lack of episodic memory and internal monologue (AI cannot do step by step inside its mind),** but it is absolutely coming. As a person with a strong synthetic intelligence (I also intuit instantons rather than do step-by-step analysis) - AI is already so far ahead of humans that 99% of people cannot even see it. Both Gemini and Claude instantly understand concepts that humans with IQ below 145 really struggle with - and can build on them and further develop them. This is a qualitative dimension that cannot be even explained to people who see intelligence as “faster and more of the same”.
(emphasis mine)

EDIT3: 

It seems to not be doing ""think, check, think, check, think, check"" cycles which we do, but it excels at associating ideas and constructing chains of ideas. I'm pretty sure there is someone working on think-check cycles, or maybe this person has not heard about AI doing it.

EDIT4:

Next comment explains it.
> Actually, the larger LLMs can do step-by-step reasoning. Prompt engineering is the name for set of techniques or best practices to get the best results from a LLM. One of the techniques to help the model with more advanced reasoning is to ask the LLM to reason through its answer step by step.
This comment, along with your post above about LLMs ""divulging the truth"" when they determine you are smart enough, indicates that you aren't familiar with how this type of AI works.

Tariffs have a place in trade.  Using a combination of carrots and sticks can help to prop up on-shore production and protect it once it's in place.  You can't just use nothing but sticks and try to beat the hell out of companies until they agree to do what you want.  In a lot of cases, they can't onshore.  In other cases, they already have a presence but they can't find the workers with the necessary skills in sufficient quantities.  

The reality is that the U.S. just isn't a great place to manufacture things anymore.  Costs, across the board, are high here.  Meanwhile, the societal carrots and sticks have pushed people away from ""blue collar"" jobs.  No amount of tariffs and recessions is going to change that.

technology,1jmjkzl,mkc50hj,"In some parts of Norway, especially around the capital city of Oslo, electric cars are nearly half of all the passenger vehicles on the road. That means they won’t be stopping at gas stations anytime soon to fill their tanks.

  
There is an entire industry that caters to motorists who need to purchase gasoline or (Heaven forbid!) diesel fuel in order to continue their journeys, whether to the grocery store or to some exotic location in Europe. Many have adopted the idea of being mini malls where drivers can purchase food, beverages, and sundries like sunglasses, hair spray, or mittens. But those EV drivers won’t be buying any of that stuff — which sells at a rather high markup because there isn’t much opportunity for competitive shopping while on the road — unless they can charge the batteries in their cars at the same time. To lure those drivers, many service center operators are removing one or more gas pumps and installing EV chargers instead. According to Bloomberg Hyperdrive, at the Uno-X Furuset service area on the outskirts of Oslo, four gas pumps have become three. The cement base where one pump used to be is now ready to accept an EV charger in its place.

  
Circle K and St1 are Norway’s first and third largest service center owners. At their facilities near Oslo, a similar change is taking place as those companies try to figure out how to tap the market for EV drivers the way they have for drivers of conventional cars. At some service areas, the fuel pumps are all being removed to make way for EV chargers. “We are looking to build a bridge from the traditional gasoline and diesel business,” Ole Johannes Tonnessen, the chief operating officer of Uno-X Mobility Norway, said during a recent visit to Furuset. “We have gone from the traditional, to targeting the future.”

  
Bloomberg says the number of gas pumps is shrinking worldwide. In the UK, there are 80% fewer stations today than there were 60 years ago. While large oil companies have some of the biggest networks of service areas, they account for only 14 percent of ultra-fast chargers in Europe. Since Norway is poised to be the world’s first all-EV market, it is a harbinger of the changes that are coming to the industry",26,2025-03-29 10:46:44,Wagamaga

I’ve seen this story before. This tech gets “invented” every once in a while, but I don’t think it’ll ever see market.

First, there are just too many drugs. Rohypnol, GHB, ketamine, scopolamine, chloral hydrate, even OTC medicines. A generic test greatly increases the chance of of false negative.

Second, there just are too many drinks. There is an unlimited variety of test environments (hot, cold, carbonated, acids, bases, dairy, organic solvents, exotic extracts, etc etc.); a generic testing regime it simply not feasible.

Third, what possible reason is there to put the test in a straw? If you’re concerned enough to pull out this straw and test your drink, surely you’re cautious enough not to *drink it first*! The key difference between this and a (safe, reliable test strip) is that it encourages you to sip suspicious drinks, which is the exact opposite of its purpose.

Lastly, this product is a legal and ethical nightmare, for reasons that should by now be obvious. Anything less that a rigorous, accurate, and specific test puts the consumer at unacceptable risk of harm. A faulty drug-testing straw is potentially worse than no test at all.

AFAIK this is just a thing where high-school students to win a school prize for “inventing” an impossible technology:

> Three students at Gulliver Preparatory School in Pinecrest, Fla., invented Smart Straws that turn blue in the presence of the most common date rape drugs.

I grew up with the only computer in my bedroom. Age 14 is when I got my first computer. My parents had no idea what the internet really was so they never worried about it. Such videos existed but I more responded with anger when friend sent them to me rather than interest. I think there was a website that some friends viewed called, ""Faces of death"" Disturbed me. Friends know not to send me videos of people getting hurt. Even people falling down I don't want to see. I believe many of us have a natural aversion to seeing pain in others. But, I'm just me, I don't represent everyone. I wouldn't bet on everyone being like me. Such videos along with encouragement from your ""online friend"" might unlock something in some people. That's scary. If you're a parent, keep the computers in the family room and always be aware of how they are being used.

That experience paved the way for the C919, China’s first real attempt at challenging the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 head-on. The aircraft uses modern avionics and Western engines, but it is designed, assembled, and delivered under Chinese control. More importantly, it’s being pushed into the fleet not as a speculative startup venture, but with the full weight of the Chinese state behind it.

technology,1jlcmuj,mk4ble9,"This is such an iffy article thought. Only known as ‘the researchers’ - let alone a link for it.

I often like getting into looking at these things - because they so often seem to miss some crucial noise.

Generally, they always group minorities, when in the weeds - it is black people getting totally done over, and a different minority (often similar ones). And then the whole thing is broken. Because if Latinos are average - then that is a huge distinction. And then (Lyft drivers not so ruinous) - zero look at socio economic background. I know in the UK (as seen more there and actually the govt surveys are good at this) - once you look at through that lense - is that by far the biggest determinant of that race by comparison is immaterial. That poverty is the reason. And because some ethnic groups tend to poorer - they conflate the numbers with racism. 

They may say the historical racism is why they are poorer. But again - miniscule. If I escaped moved to China with only my labour to work in, and not a word of Chinese - well I’ll be poor as shit. And is will my kids probably. So if you’re only on 2nd generation - well economically not surprising.

I remember seeing some Stanford prejudice in raising money. Black people did worse, but research is confiscating as Asians do better.

So dumb. The premise is presumably white have hidden storms of racism. No - even when really taking out socio economic and other things - black people do worse. But not really anyone else. When you control for income and childhood chances in poor areas in the UK White boys do worst.

So that’s why you can trust these pieces - how I end up in the source. But without sharing - the whole thing is worthless. Because what if black men all drive Lyft in the ghetto or say downtown where cops are around .and white people all in the big open road suburbs. Well maybe no racism?

> Key findings

> - Hundreds of thousands of chip design and fabrication research papers were released between 2018 and 2023, but the field isn't growing as fast as hotter topics like AI.

> - China produces by far the most chip design and fabrication research publications, with more papers from 2018-2023 than the next three countries combined.

> - China also leads in top-cited chip publication output, with half of the top-cited articles featuring authors from Chinese organizations and universities.

> - Most recent growth in published chip design and fabrication research came from China and India, while research output from most other countries actually shrunk over time.",7,2025-04-22 02:52:15,teethgrindingaches

technology,1jz1oll,mn2qrop,"When an outbreak of deadly tornadoes tore through the small town of Mayfield, Kentucky, in December 2021, one family was slow to act, not because they didn’t know what to do. They didn’t know that they should do anything.

The family of Guatemalan immigrants only spoke Spanish, so they didn’t understand the tornado alert that appeared on their cell phones in English. “I was not looking at \[an information source\] that told me it was going to get ugly,” Rosa, identified only by her first name, told researchers for a study on how immigrant communities responded to the warnings. 

  
Another alert popped up in Spanish, and Rosa and her family rushed downstairs to shelter. Ten minutes later, a tornado destroyed the second floor where they’d been. 

For at least 30 years, the National Weather Service, or NWS, had been providing time- and labor-intensive manual translations into Spanish. Researchers have found that even delayed translations have contributed to missed evacuations, injuries, and preventable deaths. These kinds of tragedies prompted efforts to improve the speed and scope of translating weather alerts at local, state, and national levels",62,2025-04-14 15:30:48,Wagamaga
