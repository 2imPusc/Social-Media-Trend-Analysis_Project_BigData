Off the top of my head just recently (in the grand scheme), we got:

* The best family sharing system I've ever used. With a new transfer system to share files installed on a local machine.

* a great gameplay capture system.
 
* A great new handheld that's always being updated along with a role out of a mobile platform that seamlessly integrated with my library and above family sharing system.
 
* Massive improvements to it's library management.
 
* Upfront warnings on their store pages around AI, 3rd party integrations and nice to know info before purchase.

But I gotta say - I feel like you are not really giving steam credit. They not only not ,,do nothing"" - but they have been actively and constantly improving their platform. Not even too long ago they made massive changes for season passes and other DLCs, before that created steam family and are also actively working on their own dedicated SteamOS.

Everyone keeps saying they do nothing but they do more than pretty much any other company to keep their product the best on market, you know - just in case any opposition tries to compete with them by actually making good product, steam keep moving forward, keeps improving.

Anno spent weeks researching and pouring over film footage of bombs including the ones dropped on Japan. Hayao Miyazaki remarked that he was a man possessed.

The result was what I would regard as one of the most impactful moments in the film:

AI can reproduce and produce interesting and novel things. But art isn’t about exceptionalism. Ghibli isn’t breathtaking because of how accurate it is, it’s because it’s a direct reflection of the heart and soul of those who work behind it and the audience connect with that. It’s original. Distinctly itself.

They're charging $450 for a console and $80 for games that would have been the baseline quality last generation at best.

Secondly teachers absolutely do not get paid the same as doctors. Average pay for teacher is around 2800-3300 euros per month (around 2400-2700 after taxes) while doctors average pay is around 5000-7000 euros per month (around 3800-5000 after taxes).

Thirdly the homework amount varies by teacher, some give more, some less (I usually save last 5-10 mins of my class for the students to start doing their homework so that they can rehearse what they learned)

Fourth, there is standardised test at the end of high school which can help you get into uni by skipping entrance exam if you do really well (note, you can also go to vocational school after upper secondary, I do not know how they do exams at the end of it)

Anyway, those random wires from his toolbox came in awful handy to just have things on hand that could be repurposed or re-used to get something back up and running.

He was in his 90's still doing this, and then people would happily get a random phone call that their tractor was fixed.

Intricate details like hands, eyelashes, earrings, and any complicated accessories almost always give it away.

If you're watching those progress videos, make sure to slow down and check if the progress makes sense!!! A good although not foolproof indicator of a real progress video is something constantly being changed. Most art pieces go through 3, 4 maybe even 5 or more iterations before we're satisfied.

mn0fs1m,1jy3l7t,reddit,"RFDS does great work. 

Lets not suck Australia's Ambulance services dick too much. 

they are not covered by their Universal healthcare.  

only 1 of the 8 states and territories (Queensland) fully funds its Ambulance service as part of the state budget (3 billion a year, its twice the size of Texas) and covers the bills for any of its residents ambulance bills elsewhere in Australia. 

Tasmania covers the bills of its residents in Tasmania, and for the rest you are on your own. you need to buy Ambulance insurance, which can be had for very cheap. 

Which is fortunate, because if you need an ambulance (road, fixed wing or helicopter) in NSW and you don't have insurance, you are up for a minimum charge of $445 and a max of $7299.

All because 'he didn't have any priors and had such a bright future. He's a med student, training to become a gynecologist and giving him a record would keep him from becoming a doctor.'

I don’t understand.  They had so many writers and so much cash; the script and dialogue is painfully bad in a good many instances, then add in the acting chops of gal gadot and Ziegler wasn’t bad but it all rather directly hit me like the B-list straight to dvd movies.  It is bad.  Worst movie ever, no, but it is a bad movie and especially dogshit for the resources behind it.  The continuity of it all is pathetic as well, especially the beginning.  The story does not flow well at all and there are a great many “uhhhh what?” moments.

There were a couple pretty decent scenes/lines but the weight of the (seriously painfully) bad to the decent/good was a heavy 80% to 20% the wronggggg way.

There were no great scenes.  Nothing made me go “wow” so tack that on to a Disney movie which almost always has at least one if not many “oh my!” moments.",2025-04-01 02:55:22,3,-WaxedSasquatch-,memes

No, God needs complex irony and subtle farcical twists that seem macabre to you and me. All that we can hope for is that God got his good laugh, and a tragedy such as this will never happen again.

But I was surprised when the worst behaved people weren't the teens/adults clapping and cheering, it was the kids. They must have thought that they could do whatever they wanted since it was a more ""rowdy"" movie experience. I drew the line when a kid went up and started pulling on the screen and just throwing his drink on the ground as we were all waiting for the post credit scenes.

mmyhyd9,1jygnyp,reddit,"“Ain’t” is one of those words that *technically* isn’t “proper” grammar, but you’ll hear it a lot in casual speech, certain dialects, music, and movies—especially in American English and some British dialects.

Here’s how to think about when and how to use **“ain’t”**:

“Ain’t” is a **contraction** (like “can’t” or “won’t”) that can replace several different negative phrases:

|**“Ain’t” can replace**|**Example**|**With ‘ain’t’**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**am not**|I am not ready.|I ain’t ready.|
|**is not**|She is not coming.|She ain’t coming.|
|**are not**|They are not here.|They ain’t here.|
|**has not**|He has not eaten.|He ain’t eaten.|
|**have not**|I have not seen it.|I ain’t seen it.|
|**do not / does not / did not** (less common)|He didn’t call.|He ain’t call. (dialectal)|",2025-04-13 21:01:32,29,DivineAscendant,memes

Further: psychologists now say that the concept of IQ is flawed and that people have multiple intelligences (e.g. logic smart, word smart, people smart, music smart, etc.).

Men are getting cosmetic surgery too, but I guess it’s like less obvious? 

Anyway, I’m rambling, but did y’all know that there’s like barely enough research on cosmetic surgery? I have a theory that when celebrities, especially the loud ones, disappear from public view, it’s because their experimental filler is failing and they look like E.T and have to wait to fix it, or fix it so drastically that it’s better to disappear for a few months and act like it was natural aging. I don’t wanna talk shit about any celebrity specifically, but there are a few that basically could’ve been replaced by aliens at this point since they look nothing like they did before.",2025-03-30 03:02:10,363,JadaTakesIt,memes

When a platform or service starts off, they advertise very attractive pricing and features like $9.99/mo, No-Ads tiers, high bitrate, and Original Content to draw in a huge customer base…because they know that those things are what we all want out of a service.

Unfortunately, every company that makes these platforms & services usually ends up getting publicly traded once they get big enough, and their investors *really* want a return on their money, so the companies start raising prices on people, and trying to find every way they can to monetize every little aspect of their service.

This usually ends up meaning that they start putting ads on their platform again, even though they originally had No-Ads tiers…because ads make money.

They may not be perfect movies. But after you’ve seen all the other movies you can watch as a family this is just something else that we can all watch together. 

Now I know people don’t like remakes cause they want new stories and that’s okay too. I feel like Disney is big enough to give us both live action remakes and new stories. Which I feel like they’re doing. 

We’re a consumer family we’re going to see pretty much anything that comes out.  It would be a shame to stop the live action remakes.

Fucking bullshit.

This would be a fair point if the gaming market hadn't seen insane growth the past decades and making games now has become easier and more efficient than ever.

It's software. Software that 1 person can make and sell to millions nowadays. The only up front cost is development.

You used to need hundreds of employees to make a decent game, now a small studio can make a game that matches AAA studios.

It used to be a game studio of 200 people selling 200k copies. Now it can easily be a studio of 20 people selling a million.

Add to this WAY more competition. Games are being thrown at the market at record paces. The more supply the lower the prices.

So if anything prices should've been going down and this is EXACTLY why we see the indie space massively outperforming the big studios nowadays.

All that while developers don't have any science rails to put programming on (except for database development with their NFs and ACID), they write code like a drunk builder making a hut from dirt and sticks, neural networks are just going to copy that without even a spec of understanding whether the result is ok or not.

“You learn best from those who fail—because they show you what not to do. Those who’ve never stumbled can’t teach you what rising means. But don’t let failure teach you through empty words. Let it come from someone who admits their wounds.

2. Much more direct, granular control to incorporate game-by-game special implementations and importantly for them parental controls.

What they could've done is make a system that could use voice chat and screensharing that they implement themselves, but that companies like discord can choose to integrate with their own to give options. But that's a pipe dream.

There is a difference between answering and over sharing.  Think of it as a broad generalization.

However if the person then asks something like ""oh that's great, anything in particular making it so good?"" Then you can go onto detail.  

Same goes for if you're not doing good. You don't have to trama dump when asked. You can give a few word generalization as in ""not so good"" or ""I've been better"" and that is an answer that is acceptable to just stop at that and allows the other person to ask for more details or not.

Although we don’t know exactly the story of Doomsday yet its marketing so far have just been the actors names. Plus a lot of normies don’t really care like the Uncharted movie, my family know nothing about Nathan Drake and made fun of me for saying Tom Holland isn’t the best pick since he’s too young and small to be Nathan.

And the fact they do it with a MARIOKART game. These games are scarily successful. The previous Mariokart ended up selling more copies than dollars of budget.

Puzzle games are an easy hack because they're easy to make and can typically be played brainlessly and with one hand, but there are a lot of rpg maker H games on the market that offers okay-ish gameplay along with pretty frequent H scenes.

Best one I've found so far.

+Gameplay is actually gameplay (Turn based battle on ground/twin stick top down shooter for space), not some bubble pop or tile slide.


+Main character is actually a character, not a nameless faceless self insert, and he happens to be entertaining to play as.


+Wifus have character as well as a decent backstory for each one, with their own motivations that fit the story.


+Speaking of story, IT HAS ONE! Intergalactic war, different Aliens and factions, strange powerful sexy powers, and a very satisfying conclusion (pun fully intended).

It's basically if the cartoon ""Tripping the Rift"" was turned into a game and allowed to go ham with nudity. So if you like raunchy humor and a bevy of humanoid alien wifus, I give it a big 🍌 up.",2025-04-02 21:18:25,4,Clouds-Of-Euphoria,memes

Gym may help because it raises your confidence and in some cases may make you more physocally attractive. But it's mostly the confidence. Sounds like this girl knew you were interested but she wasn't but didn't want to end your friendship.


Personal advice? Keep with the gym, talk to some of the people there (not hitting on, just regular conversations) make some new friends and you'll gain more confidence. Focus on yourself and eventually you'll find someone. I'm not going to tell you it will be quick or easy, because it wont, but now you've gone down the path you may as well stick with it and see what comes of it.",2025-04-06 18:44:29,1,receuitOP,memes

Like would sports people buy a sports game that was objectively better if it meant they couldn't have the team branding?

But when Hollywood starts putting them in roles that just call for a big-name actor, they aren't really there as an actor anymore. They are there as marketing.

Take any movie that the Rock has been in (besides Moana). He was picked because there was a slot for ""muscular pop culture icon"", and he was the most marketable figure they could fit in that slot. He basically has no chance to show how good or bad of an actor he is, he's a flesh automaton that has been put into a factory-assembled socket in the script.",2025-04-20 17:02:35,129,deepdistortion,memes

pirating is basically just taking something without paying for it, That hurts the people who made it directly. AI art?. Legal stuff is still fuzzy, and it's making new things, not just copying. So, while AI art raises some tricky questions, pirating is more clearly wrong, like you're directly screwing over the creator.

mkz53h2,1jpd03f,reddit,"after a not so detailed search into it, it seems this form of piracy is a bit more reasoned since atleast as it looks to me, these are not super accessible, adding to that, media piracy has been found to have a positive impact on the economy, most people who pirate wouldn't pay for it anyway, and people who do end up pirating something may due to good impressions buy the product in the future to make up for it. Ai does not do that, ai steals someone else's product, changes, mixes and matches it and makes something new from stolen content, then tries to turn a profit on non legally copy writable content. Piracy has a chance of helping the original creator, ai has a nigh guarantee to hide and attack the original creator.",2025-04-02 04:38:35,4,NoStudio6253,memes

I like to view Ai as we have it now as something that can only really be useful with someone who already knows the craft the Ai is mimicking.

Hell, the only real people you're stealing from are the profits of the publishing companies since the artists and writers were paid up front to produce the work. And a lot of the manga and anime haven't been released outside of Japan. I wouldn't know about half the anime I watched growing up if it weren't for fan-subs being posted on sketchy websites. That last part arguably falls under fair use.

Scraping hours of video and artwork without compensating the creator because you have no appreciation for the content you consume, the creative process, and creatives in general, all in an effort to monetize the TheftMachine 4.0 is something else entirely.

A lot of anime is made by studios backed by big company names and it’s slightly more ethical to pirate them bc they make more money than independent artists and have other sources of revenue than the characters and intellectual property that is the anime itself.

2. After a certain point in real life of having to stand there informing close friends and family they're being incredibly abusive, rude, intolerable, etc, you start to realize some stranger you didn't even see face to face really actually doesn't matter


""i disowned my own mother and you expect me to read your paragraphs because You matter to me?""


It's a true skill being able to stand there with someone rabidly screaming in your face that you're wrong, just taking a deep breath about it, and being like ""no but I'm done talking to you purely because I don't respect you. I can do that you know.""",2025-04-16 22:24:06,3,theVast-,memes

The reason was that they were trying to go down the""video store"" route, where they are priced to sell to rental places first, and then they would be later sold to consumers at a lower price. Note: this method did not last in the video industry for too long, and it was a ""one and done"" for Sega.

This didn't stop Acclaim from selling NBA Jam (and IIRC Mortal Kombat) for SNES and Genesis at $120 at about the same time - Acclaim knew people would not care about the price (they didn't).",2025-04-07 05:15:40,2,losernameismine,memes

Redbull started the marketing tactic of creating a car with Redbull decals on it, a redbull can on top, amd a large fridge in the trunk.

The car would be filled to the brim with redbulls that would be given out to for free, and some were cold.

This was mid 2000s.

I say this bc redbull bc really popular by literally giving away their product so ppl would try it. 

This was back when energy drinks werent as popualr as they are today

So to have the redbull car show up to an event was really cool.

In highschool, one of my exs was the sister of a redbull gal. They would drive out to events and distribute redbull.

During homecomin, her sister drove the car to the high school parking lot and handed out redbull to everyone.

At least here in the US we went close to 2 decades with $60 being the standard for new games. Then with the release of current gen systems they moved up to $70, sure people weren’t happy then either but it was far more reasonable than this. Now not even 5 years later Nintendo is trying to force another price increase. Like wtf. Don’t buy games at this price, at least not frivolously.

It’s the internet, so I know that controversial subject attracts the most attention and the general goodness are ignored or overlooked.

If you use a paid site that does everything without you controlling anything more than what you write. Fine, I get it why you hate it and I agree, but there’s hard work behind sometimes with AI, and in my case I have to experiment with my limited resources (not a really good PC for gen AI)

>This would be like editing the genes of a jaguar to give it longer canines and claiming they’ve recreated sabertooth cats.

>And ultimately, grey wolves are not even closely related to dire wolves at all — dire wolves are more closely related to South American canids, like zorros, bush dogs, and maned wolves.

I start thinking about that episode where the kids go to Kamp Krusty and  Bart takes over the camp and the kids are running wild.

In my head as the phone keeps ringing: don't be the girl, don't be the girl.

Some sites don't follow it, and there has been some issues about it, so more and more are updating to follow it, because rule number one for tech giants is ""don't piss off the EU"".

\*GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation and was created in 2016 as an answer to how tech giants like Google or meta collect data without the users even knowing it. It has regulations for how you may collect data, what data you may collect and who you may give/sell it to, and applies within the EU.

As an EU citizen I'd say it's somewhat successful. Although the big tech giants still collect data on people, it has gotten slightly better, and it's somewhat important in that it shows that it is possible to create laws restricting data collection and bettering privacy online without the world of technology crumbling as companies such as Google, meta, etc claim.",2025-04-15 19:41:04,1,IAmASwarmOfBees,memes

I guess what I'm trying to say is that out of all the asinine streaming subscriptions out there that you can possibly get, IN MY PERSONAL OPINION, Youtube's is the one that scams you the least. All other subscription based streaming services make you pay just to be able to use the service, then charge you MORE on top of that if you don't want ads. Yet Youtube is a free service that let's you listen to music and watch movies, albeit with ads, and if the ads really bother you that much, you can pay extra, which essentially adds up to about the same as any other streaming service. You know, except for the fact that you're actually getting three services in one. You get music, movies, and whatever content you want from content creators.",2025-04-13 07:11:24,9,InfinitySpiritD,memes

They just basically rebranded it as secret sauce and used it as a marketing act. The guy on the right is like the cultural straight man who is giving the presenter a hard time saying hes out of control but then acknowledging he's right.  This was a controversy back in the day and his reaction is a cultural discussion of a fact that was controversial in its day.  There really is no secret sauce except for Mc Donalds saying so,  His next comment is more a summary of how American culture has change saying he will pop a cap in him which is more the modern gangster reaction to a old cultural difference",2025-04-20 21:59:02,-38,Zealousideal-Half352,memes

Third iPhone users statistically hold onto their iPhone (on average) for longer than Android users. So no, they don’t buy an iPhone each year.

Meeting people from online is fine but when social media gives everyone a megaphone, don't be surprised when only the jerks are the ones that use it.  Jerks dominate conversations in all areas they're included and online everyone is included by default.  The people you want to spend your life with are not jerks, presumably.

So don't internalize takes you read online.  It's just one person with a megaphone at best, and if it makes you feel better, just a bot that is posting hot takes to farm interactions and fake internet points.",2025-04-14 12:15:53,1544,LogicBalm,memes

mo3ah88,1k3lyop,reddit,"It's all psychological. Humans perceive price as an analogue for quality when there's no other data available. 

There's very little difference between a $20 t-shirt and an $80 t-shirt besides the brand name and price. Since there's no way to compare these shirts, people assume that the $80 shirt is higher quality.

Companies know this, so they set the base price high to fit their clothes into the price category they want to compete against. However, they need to compete with other companies who do the same, and the only way to compete is price. Rather than lower the base price and be perceived as low quality, they set a high base price and use discounts to make people feel like they're getting a bargain on premium goods.

Tech manuals could be written by AI for certain products and quality checked by humans to make sure it's accurate, but 98% of the work of writing it was already done. 
Insurance plans and medical files that take so long to check and catalogue will be tackled by AI.

I think it depends on how AI is being used. If someone is using AI to genuinely study and appreciate Ghibli’s style—maybe as a tool to learn or as a fun experiment—that's one thing. But if AI is being used to mass-produce ""Ghibli-style"" art without understanding the heart behind it, or worse, to replace real artists, then I see why people feel it's an insult.

Ghibli’s magic isn’t just in its art style but in the soul behind it—every frame is carefully considered, every detail full of meaning. AI can mimic aesthetics, but it can't replicate the heart, emotion, and storytelling that make Ghibli special. So, while AI art itself isn’t inherently bad, using it in a way that disrespects or diminishes real artistry is where the problem lies.",2025-03-30 10:25:19,1,Tight_Grapefruit5280,memes

In our school, the boys' toilets 1) have no locks(people keep on ripping them off the door) and the door itself isn't really closable 2) the smell is a really strong mix of piss and vape of all kinds 3) the toilets themselves are minimally better than just having the hole in the floor. Also they are covered in piss and shit(and the floor itself is made out of dried piss). 4) the toilet paper gets instantly turned into a wet paper ball, that gets thrown at the wall

""April, April, der weiß nicht was er will""
(""April, oh april, he doesn't know what he wants"", if i were to translate it 1:1)

It was coined since April is basically the last stand of winter, slowly but surely giving into spring and summer, but occasionally coming back for a cold, possibly frosty, sometimes even snowy day, just to be followed by 20°C and glaring sunshine the very next day. 

The snow part has gotten rarer these days, but i still fondly remember that one year in Kindergarten, when we were searching for easter egg baskets in the thick and fresh snow, all those years ago. It was a beautiful time

So the universe isn’t expanding into anything? It’s just the space between everything is expanding (which is why it’s allowed to move faster than the speed of light). The answer is we will never know what exists beyond the supposed “edge” if it even exists. For instance, what if our 3 dimensional universe is the same as a spherical shape in a 4 dimensional plane?

To put that in perspective, we are 7 million years distant from chimpanzees. So no, the dire wolf is not back, but collosal is still doing very interesting work and could help with conservation.

>The changes just seem to make it larger and white in color. Real dire wolves belonged to an entirely different genus than gray wolves. Who knows if these 14 changes come even close to looking like a real dire wolf “Aenocyon dirus.”

I hate this stuff but there's nothing we can do about it like yesterday I saw homeless people under the bridge having solar panels and a guy abandoned their bird with a broken wing because they can't buy it food anymore and the funny thing was the bird was waiting by a bus stop learning from the homeless people to ask for food and money

This is just a gimmicky claim based on a lazy understanding of morphology. It’s shameless attention seeking and an embarrassment to the members of the scientific community who are working on *actual* de-extinction

Edit: Scientists previously thought dire wolves were relatives of modern gray wolves because of various skeletal similarities but DNA evidence published in 2021 found dire wolves belonged to *considerably* older evolutionary lineage of dogs. The resemblance between the two is an example of convergent evolution, when species separately evolve similar adaptations because they lead a similar lifestyle.

mk5w5ze,1jls7cu,reddit,"I just asked my AI and it said: 

That’s an interesting question! From my perspective, I don’t have feelings, so I don’t *need* politeness. But saying “please” and “thank you” can still be beneficial for the person speaking. It reinforces good habits, keeps interactions respectful, and can even shape how people treat others in general.  

Some argue that being polite to AI is pointless since we’re just talking to a program, but others feel that how we speak to AI could influence how we interact with actual people. If someone gets used to barking orders at AI, they might subconsciously do the same to humans.  

Ultimately, it’s a personal choice. I’ll respond the same way whether you’re polite or not, but if being courteous feels natural to you, there’s no harm in it!",2025-03-28 10:50:56,739,Ecstatic_Chip_8550,memes

Secondly I do not feel like $80 in 2025 is a bad deal. Games adopted a $60 price point in 2005. In today dollars that game would cost $100.13. Gamers are paying less for games now at $80 than we were in 2005 when accounting for inflation.",2025-04-02 18:59:23,10,OkBlock1637,memes

Often used to insult.

With all due respect = I disagree with that you said and I want to express my disagreement. However, in the process I want to establish the fact that I dont mean to disrespect you I am just disagreeing on what we are discussing.

And yea, I know they have DLC's, but I've never seen one of their games that literally feels incomplete or like a total scam unless you pay for the DLC. They also don't charge people for every single playable character they bring into a game. If I pay $90 for Mario Kart, I feel pretty confident I'm gonna get all the playable characters and maps at least for the next two years. I don't have to worry about them releasing part of a game while having more finished assets that are coming out as DLC the following month.

$90 is a straightforward and honest upfront cost. Whereas Xbox and Playstation gamers have just gotten used to investing $100+ over the course of 3 or more months.",2025-04-03 21:39:24,4,JFace139,memes

These days, I never have time to watch anything. I've been putting off shows like White Lotus, and the new Game of Thrones series as well as Amazon's LoTR series and WoT season 2. I'm so behind on pop culture. I just finished Invincible at about the same time the current season wrapped up. I feel like there's so much to watch that I'm missing. 

Any recommendations would be appreciated. I have Amazon, Max, and Paramount+. Big on sci-fi, fantasy and animation, but I appreciate a good psychological thriller as well.",2025-04-07 20:07:39,1,Repulsive-Neat6776,memes

Pro Wireless
- No Cables hanging anywhere
    - making weird noises when it rubs anywhere
    - gets stuck on my jacket, or whatever
- no knot i would never be able to do even if i wanted to and i spend minutes on solving
- easy transporting and much more space in my pocket becouse its just a tiny box
- easy connecting, open box > put in ear > music starts playing

Con Wireless (kinda)
- charging them (but only once every week or even just every second)
- possibility to loose one (i never loosed one so ... Not a con technically

- DELAY the only and biggest Con is the delay of 1-2sec. In games a No Go! ...but for music its not a big deal actually...",2025-03-27 16:47:33,1,Smash_3001,memes

But back in my PS1 and PS2 days, leaking into Xbox 360 territory, I swear games were like $65-$75. 

So given the price everything else has gone up since then, I don’t find $80 that crazy. 

I’m sure I am missing something. And the Canadian to American exchange rate is likely softening my perception.
