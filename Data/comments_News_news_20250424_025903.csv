Calling it a ""deportation"" is like calling attempted murder, a friendly tussle.

Supporting deportations and thinking the deportations are justified, doesn't require you to agree with turning a deportation order into life imprisonment in a dictatorship, paid for with your tax dollars.

>""Defendants argue that the United States may send a deportable alien to a country not of their origin, not where an immigration judge has ordered, where they may be immediately tortured and killed, without providing that person any opportunity to tell the deporting authorities that they face grave danger or death because of such a deportation,"" Judge Murphy wrote.

\---

These aren't a deportation in any traditional sense of the word and we should not call nor acknowledge them using ""deportation.""

It wasn't removal from the country. It was U.S. law enforcement physically handing over two hundred plus people in custody (often with a questionable basis) over to El Salvador's law enforcement to throw them in a dictator's prison camp without trial, due process, or any legal recourse, all paid for by the U.S. taxpayer.

That is what we call an extraordinary rendition, or state-sponsored kidnapping, paid for by the U.S. taxpayer.

Calling it a deportation buries the lead and plays into the alt-right/this administrations' narrative. Likewise it makes it harder to explain the problem here, as it phrases the complaint as against people being sent back to their country of origin.

To be clear we aren't deporting people from the country; we are using U.S. taxpayer dollars to pay a dictator to imprison and disappear hundreds (so far) of foreign nationals from 3rd party countries at the behest of the U.S. executive branch.

(Not that there are no problems with the deportations/process in general, but that is much harder to communicate.)",569,2025-04-18 19:46:01,Primsun

Wallace included a photo of Ellis, and the post went viral, the lawsuit states.  
Wallace deleted that original post, according to the lawsuit, and then shared two others linking Ellis to the crash. One referred to an interview that Ellis did with The Smerconish Podcast, in which she said President Donald Trump’s executive order barring trans people from serving and enlisting in the military made her nervous. 
The second post included photos of Ellis and said she might have participated in “another trans terror attack,” according to the lawsuit. That post received 4.8 million views on X, the suit states.

I was a flight instructor for nearly a decade. I taught hundreds of students from recreational private pilots, up through commercial pilots and flight instructors. I taught many women, people of color, and even one trans person (that I knew of). And of course, mostly white dudes. 

There is *absolutely zero* correlation between a person's gender or race and their ability to fly an airplane, make critical decisions during a flight, or manage resources.

Actually, I take that back. Women were generally better at studying and were less likely to take risks. The worst students were usually rich old men. 

Airlines **do not** hire under-performing candidates to meet ""DEI quotas."" Everyone has to perform to the same standard. Sure, there may be initiatives to help those who have been subjected to an industry with a deeply ingrained ""good ol' boy"" tradition, but not at the expense of safety, performance, and quality. You either meet the standards, or you don't.

These cowards hide behind DEI and say stuff like ""Ohh I just don't like these woke hiring practices that allow under-qualified people in, women can be perfectly fine pilots too!"" But that's *bullshit.* They are cowards who refuse to say it with their chest. They think women can't be pilots. They think black people can't be pilots. They think trans people can't be pilots.

news,1jzy5bh,mn9q0d5,"From The Guardian:

>A 19-year-old Venezuelan in New York City reportedly was apprehended by Trump administration immigration authorities and deported to El Salvador despite agents’ realizing he was not whom they meant to arrest in a targeted operation.

>Merwil Gutiérrez, whose family opened an asylum case after arriving in the US, was deported from the Bronx to the notorious Cecot prison in El Salvador despite his relatives’ insistence that he has no gang ties or criminal history, according to Documented, a newsroom dedicated to telling the stories of immigrants in New York City. The Gutiérrez family says it has been left without information or answers.

>The teen was detained alongside 237 other Venezuelans on 24 February by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). His father, Wilmer Gutiérrez, told Documented: “I feel like my son was kidnapped.

>“I’ve spent countless hours searching for him, going from one precinct to another, speaking with numerous people who kept referring me elsewhere. Yet, after all this, no one has given me any information or provided a single document about his case.”

>The elder Gutiérrez reportedly said he overheard Ice agents saying that his son had not been the person they had come to get.

>**The officers grabbed him and two other boys right at the entrance to our building. One said: ‘No, he’s not the one,’ like they were looking for someone else. But the other said: ‘Take him anyway,’” he recalled.**

>**Gutiérrez has no criminal record either in Venezuela or the US, his family said. He also did not have any tattoos** which is a feature that US law enforcement often use to link people to the Tren de Aragua gang – a transnational criminal organization from Venezuela – and to justify their expulsions from the country.

>**Despite this, Gutiérrez was arrested and later deported to El Salvador, to which he has no ties.**

>Wilmer Gutiérrez says he discovered through a news report that his son had been deported to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. He watched videos on social media that showed detainees facing harsh conditions, such as having their heads shaved by authorities and being marched to their prison cells.

>”I could have understood if he’d been sent back to Venezuela,” he said. “But why to a foreign country he’s never even been to?”

>The Gutiérrez family’s reported ordeal comes after the Trump administration admitted to wrongly deporting a Maryland man, Kilmar Abrego García, to the same Cecot facility.

>The president of El Salvador said in a meeting with Trump on Monday that the Salvadoran government would not order the return of Abrego García to the US.

>Monday’s meeting at the White House came amid a broader push by the Trump administration to remove noncitizens from the US, including people who are here legally and have not been charged with crimes.

>Trump has also openly stated that he would like to remove US citizens who commit unspecified violent crimes and send them to the same Salvadoran prison as Abrego García and Gutiérrez.",6452,2025-04-15 17:46:51,Rabidennui

26 March 2025

LUCAS COUNTY — A person died from rabies after receiving a transplanted organ in Lucas County earlier this year:

>The recipient, who had undergone a kidney transplant in December, contracted the viral disease through the donated organ, according to the Toledo-Lucas County Health Department, WTOL reported.

>As the recipient was from Michigan, Michigan’s Department of Health and Human Services worked with the Ohio Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to investigate the case.

>It marks the first human case of rabies in Michigan since 2009, according to WTOL.

>No additional individuals are at risk of rabies exposure, according to the CDC.

>Kara Steele, a representative from Life Connection of Ohio, could not comment on the specific case but explained to WTOL that a donor risk assessment interview is conducted before any organ donation.

>The identities of both the recipient and the donor have not been released.

>The facility where the transplant took place has also not been disclosed. 

>However, according to the University of Toledo Medical Center’s website, it is the only organ transplant center in northwest Ohio.

>Fewer than 10 people in the United States die from rabies each year, according to the CDC.",1282,2025-03-26 19:40:17,Doodlebug510

Multiple people in the town were being diagnosed with cases of Ewing's Sarcoma (a rare bone cancer, less than 250 cases per year). One of the kids I went to school with died from it at 19, two months after graduating.

A lot of people thought there to be an environmental cause, due to the area's natural gas drilling, and factoring that Canonsburg has long been considered ""the most radioactive town in America"" due to the radium refining done there in the 1920's (later sealed in concrete and fenced off).

It was ultimately determined that there was no statistical cancer diagnosis cluster, and that the cause of all the cancer was undetermined, which really didn't make anyone feel better about, you know, all the cancer.

news,1k39nva,mo0e8zr,"SEATTLE -- Current and former Seattle police officers who attended President Donald Trump's “Stop the Steal” political rally on Jan. 6, 2021 at the U.S. Capitol are asking the nation's highest court to keep their identities anonymous in public court records. 

Using “John Doe” pseudonyms, they sued over whether the investigation into their activities should be made public. The Washington State Supreme Court ruled in February that they can be identified and that they haven't shown that public release of their names violates their right to privacy. The state supreme court denied reconsideration earlier this month and lawyers for the four officers submitted a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court, asking that the names remain protected during their legal challenge. 

Four officers who attended events in the nation’s capital on the day of an insurrection claimed they are protected under the state’s public records law. They say they did nothing wrong and that revealing their names would violate their privacy.

In the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021 events, the Seattle Police Department ordered an investigation into whether any of its officers who traveled to Washington, D.C. to attend the rally had violated any laws or department policies.

The investigation found that married officers Caitlin and Alexander Everett crossed barriers set up by the Capitol police and were next to the Capitol Building, in violation of the law, prompting Diaz to fire the pair. Investigators said three other officers had not violated policies and the fourth case was ruled “inconclusive.”

Sam Sueoka, a law student at the time, filed records requests seeking disclosure of the investigation's records for the participating officers. 

“We are reviewing the Does' motion for a stay,” Neil Fox, one of the Sueoka's attorneys, said in an email to The Associated Press Saturday. 

Requiring the officers to use their real names in the litigation would create a chilling effect on voicing unpopular opinions, the petition to the Supreme Court said. 

“At its core, this appeal involves whether a government agency can ignore the chilling effect resulting from an employer requiring an employee to disclose their off-duty political activities and attendant impressions or motivations associated therewith, followed by widespread dissemination to those who deliberately seek this information to subject these public servants to vilification without the commission of any misconduct whatsoever,” the petition said. 

A response to the petition is due next week on Friday.",448,2025-04-19 23:51:57,StupendousMan1995

This is the real issue. Rubio can just say this guy’s presence harms our foreign policy agenda and SCOTUS has already said a judge can’t overrule that or challenge it in any way, despite Rubio not presenting any evidence to support it.

This is definitive, and very, very clear.

""The Government is directed not to remove any member of the putative class of detainees from the United States until further order of this Court,"".

If the administration defies this order there is NO question about a constitutional crisis. This will one way or another cause things to come to a head.

This administration has pushed and pushed, however I think their carte blanche is wearing off, and they know it. As the walked back tariffs on most of the world, and backed down from confrontations with Harvard and other Universities. Behind the scenes there is push back from the wealthy who ordered one brand of order, and got another.

They were pushing to get certain things done, and now their unified front of support is seeing cracks.

I am not saying what will happen, I am saying this is pushing the line very far for some of their constitutionalist supporters and companies, that depend on the rule of law to be upheld at least at the supreme court level, even if it is bad law.

>“They claim that the court is powerless to order any relief,’’ Sandoval-Moshenberg told me. **“If that’s true, the immigration laws are meaningless—all of them—because the government can deport whoever they want, wherever they want, whenever they want, and no court can do anything about it once it’s done.”**
> . . .
>Abrego Garcia’s family has had no contact with him since he was sent to the megaprison in El Salvador, known as CECOT. His wife spotted her husband in news photographs released by Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele on the morning of March 16, after a U.S. district judge had told the Trump administration to halt the flights.

> **“Oopsie,” Bukele wrote on social media, taunting the judge.**

>Abrego Garcia’s wife recognized her husband’s decorative arm tattoo and scars, according to the court filing. The image showed Salvadoran guards in black ski masks frog-marching him into the prison, with his head shoved down toward the floor. CECOT is the same prison that Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited last week, recording videos for social media while standing in front of a cell packed with silent detainees.

>If the government wants to deport someone with protected status, the standard course would be to reopen the case and introduce new evidence arguing for deportation. The deportation of a protected-status holder has even stunned some government attorneys I’ve been in touch with who are tracking the case, who declined to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak to the press. “What. The. Fuck,” one texted me.

>**Sandoval-Moshenberg told the court that he believes Trump officials deported his client “through extrajudicial means because they believed that going through the immigration judge process took too long, and they feared that they might not win all of their cases.’’**",1113,2025-04-01 14:22:22,ProletarianParka

The request would have left the case hanging over Adams' head so that if he did not do exactly what the Trump admin asked, they could refile charges and prosecute Adams as punishment for defying the Trump admin.  It was, in every sense of the word, leverage. A quid pro quo.

The Judge dismissed the case with prejudice, meaning it cannot be resurrected no matter what happens and there is no longer this leverage hanging over Adam's head.

news,1jpp3rb,ml13dn7,">“Some will undoubtedly find today’s decision unsatisfying, wondering why, if DOJ’s ostensible reasons for dropping this case are so troubling, the Court does not simply deny the Motion to Dismiss altogether. But, as explained above, the Court cannot order DOJ to continue the prosecution, and it is aware of no authority (outside of the criminal contempt context) that would empower it, as some have urged, to appoint an independent prosecutor,” Judge Ho wrote. “Therefore, any decision by this Court to deny the Government’s Motion to Dismiss would be futile at best, because DOJ could—and, by all indications, unequivocally would—simply refuse to prosecute the case, inevitably resulting in a dismissal after seventy days for violating the Mayor’s right to a speedy trial. That route would simply postpone finality in this case to a date uncomfortably close to the June 24 mayoral primary. The public interest would not be served by such an outcome.”

So basically the judge is saying, “Yes, the reasons DOJ wanted this dismissed are bad, but I can’t force the prosecution to do their jobs, and if I dismiss with prejudice now they can’t hold these charges over the head of an elected official to manipulate them.”. These are the hard choices people have to make when the government has gone rogue and isn’t interested in prosecuting someone who, by all accounts, very obviously took bribes from a foreign government.",268,2025-04-02 14:39:52,IronSavage3

>The new site appears to use theories from the final report of the Republican-led Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic, released in December 2024. There has never been a consensus or a ""smoking gun"" to explain what started the pandemic. 

>The [COVID.gov](http://COVID.gov) page, as recently as last week, listed resources for testing, treatment, and vaccination against COVID-19, as well as information for Long COVID.

Weeks after a spa worker was found dead at a Las Vegas cryotherapy center, authorities said Tuesday she suffocated in the chamber chilled by liquid nitrogen.

Chelsea Patricia Ake-Salvacion, 24, died accidentally from the asphyxia caused by low oxygen levels, the Clark County coroner’s office said.

The death drew scrutiny to the treatment where people are subjected to extremely low temperatures not found anywhere on Earth.

Backers claim it can ease pain and inflammation, aid blood flow and weight loss, improve skin and even ward off aging and depression.

The treatments, however, have not been approved for medical use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Besides the unnecessary nature of the surgery, there’s a massive issue where these surgeons are having their patients pursue pre surg authorization from their family care providers for an out of state, out of network procedure. Then they often send them home far too early (day of), and push all post surg follow up care back onto the family care provider because the surgeon discharged them and said they were good to go home and to talk to their family care provide. The patients aren’t going to hop a flight back to Miami for care, so family med gets stuck with being cornered on taking out sutures and providing follow up care.

news,1jnrjrz,mkm3ofe,">AUSTIN, Texas - Mark Sanders, the CEO of Superior HealthPlan, was dismissed from his position following revelations that his company had hired private investigators to gather personal information on customers, journalists, and even lawmakers.

>The dismissal came just days after Sanders testified before the Texas House Committee on the Delivery of Government Efficiency, where he confirmed that private investigators had been hired to surveil individuals with the goal of uncovering sensitive details.

>In a statement to The Dallas Morning News, Centene Corporation, the parent company of Superior HealthPlan, expressed its disapproval of the actions taken by Sanders.

>“The conduct highlighted during the Texas House Committee hearing is not reflective of our values, nor is it a practice Centene’s current leadership condones,” the statement read. “To this end, Mark Sanders is no longer with our organization.”

>Following Sanders’ testimony, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s office confirmed that an investigation into the matter had been launched.

>The controversy erupted during a meeting of the House Committee on the Delivery of Government Efficiency, which was initially focused on the state’s procurement process for managed care organizations like Superior HealthPlan. Committee Chair Giovanni Capriglione, a Republican from Southlake, was quick to confront Sanders about the company’s use of taxpayer funds to hire private investigators.

>“I don’t think what any of us expected was for a health insurance company, funded mostly by Texas taxpayer dollars, to use some of those funds to hire private investigators,” Capriglione said. He pointed to one particular instance in which investigators were allegedly hired to follow a mother whose child had been denied medical care, exacerbating the child’s condition.

>When Capriglione asked Sanders directly if investigators had been employed to dig into the backgrounds of customers, government officials, and even a reporter, Sanders admitted to the practice. He explained that the goal was to learn more about the individuals with whom the company interacted, a justification that was met with scorn from Representative Matt Tinderholt.

>“You wanted leverage, and you thought that you were going to use it,” Tinderholt responded, adding, “I dare you to investigate me. Do it, and bring it.”

>In a subsequent press release, Attorney General Paxton’s office suggested that the actions might amount to potential blackmail intended to secure state contracts or avoid paying legitimate medical claims. The investigation, Paxton stated, would determine if any illegal activity had occurred.

And in Little Rock, Arkansas, a 5–year-old was killed at a home battered by severe weather.
