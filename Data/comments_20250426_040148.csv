Some places are so beautiful here that I just gotta stop and look around in awe. That art design is great and the stop-motion style rocks, though I admit I did turn it off in-game (it's still in the cutscenes, but in-game it made animals' movements look off).

The multiplayer function is nice and is about to get better on April 23. My (adult) son joined my island and we both worked on it together.

mmprwel,1jwte0a,reddit,"Hey OP, my son is 8 now and we've been playing videogames since he were 4, here are my recommendations...

The first and most important one to have a BLAST with your son is Human fall flat: https://store.steampowered.com/app/477160/Human_Fall_Flat/

It's my son preferred game, we still play it from time to time when we find new good maps.

Not only is super fun to play it (when he was younger he could laugh just at seeing the characters walk xD) but also he'll learn to cooperate and basic physics principles.

This game can give you TENS of hours.


The second one that I think you son will love is Fling to the finish: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1054430/Fling_to_the_Finish/

It's also a super fun game where both of you must properly cooperate in order to advance; this will help him in learning to cooperate and communicate with you.

Unfortunately it's a little bit short but still it's a solid choice.


Also we love two players oriented puzzle platform games, like these:

* ibb & obb: https://store.steampowered.com/app/95400/ibb__obb/

* Toodee and Topdee: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1303950/Toodee_and_Topdee/

If you're into RPGs Cat Quest 2 is a very easy and friendly one, although it have too much text for a 5yo kid, but you can give it a try: https://store.steampowered.com/app/914710/Cat_Quest_II/

After this things gets harder; Stardew Valley is fantastic but the kid must be used to read, something a 5yo might not; Lego games are solid for children but after half of one it gets boring for the adult (at least for me) so imagine after having played maybe 3 of them; Shovel Knight have a fantastic two players mode but it'll be probably too hard for a 5yo.

I hope this helps you in bonding with him :)

**Edit**: I forgot another one that my son loved it when he was at your's age, Strikey sisters, a breakout clone with some extra mechanics, he'll get good reflexes from it: https://store.steampowered.com/app/643880/Strikey_Sisters/

**Edit  2**: And another one!! Rogue heroes: Ruins of Tasos: https://store.steampowered.com/app/787810/Rogue_Heroes_Ruins_of_Tasos/

It's a SNES Zelda clone with proper local coop support, it's not bad although it was far too easy for my taste, but of course that makes it an excellent choice for a small kid.

**Edit 3**: Once he grew a little bit and get some good reflexes and cooperative skills you can try Overcooked 2, a fantastic coop game: https://store.steampowered.com/app/728880/Overcooked_2/

The problem is that the game can get HARD, I think it's not for a 5yo (don't remember at what age we played it) but you may want to save it for later.

Most of the games where you use two joysticks are too hard for him. His hands are big enough to really hold a controller and the 'one stick move, one stick camera' is a bit beyond him. (Spyro, etc) 

He does like racing games, wrc8 was on epic, plus some old arcade ones.

Farm simulator and lawn mower simulator were on epic and he likes those, but the 2 joystick thing is hard for him so he mostly just free roams (poorly). 

Basically, between epic game store and prime gaming, there are usually a few free games that pop up and are reasonable for a 5 year old. Imo just be really careful, kids are so succeptible to the addictive parts of games",2025-04-12 01:31:18,2,mm_mk,gaming

Pizza Possum might be a little too hectic for a 5 year old but it's a pretty silly game where you try to eat all the food in a town and run away from the police. It starts off as a more tactical game but once you have about half the upgrades unlocked you more often than not are running around constantly.

Pikuniku has a single player campaign that is fairly silly. Your kid may enjoy watching and maybe running around for a bit. It also has some coop levels that are unrelated to the story.

Phogs is a game where both players play as one head of a two headed dog. It's pretty silly but has a surprisingly emotional last level. One of the levels has pinball bumpers that can be fun to play with when stretching out.",2025-04-12 03:52:36,2,Hilarius,gaming

mmti0aj,1jwte0a,reddit,"I imagine your standard Nintendo games will serve well for small children.  Super Mario Wonder or 3D World would be good, but I suggest Wonder for the 2D aspect.  3D may be a little much for a young gamer but you know them better than I do.

Kirby Star Allies is also an excellent 2D game for beginners, with Kirby Forgotten Land being a viable 3D option.

Captain Toad is a neat puzzle game, but it's a 3d environment that would have been difficult for 5yo me to wrap his head around.

Yoshi's Crafted World is completely appropriate intro game to children.

Most of these games (basically all except kirby) offer overpowered power ups if you die too much so the kid doesn't get stuck and frustrated.  But they also offer difficult challenges AFTER the end (so post game content) that will definitely be too much for them, but it can be something they come back to years later to see how much theyve grown.",2025-04-13 00:16:43,2,StevynTheHero,gaming

We need you to build a **chair**🪑, some **crockery** 🍽️, and a **table** (insert table emoji I lack) to make a dinner placement!  

Super chill and casual, it's like Minecraft, but more story oriented, and cuter, rounder graphics.



Another one I would recommend is Overcooked. If you get the *All you can eat* version, it contains both games and dlc. More importantly, it gives you an assist option that can make the game significantly less stressful (except on the boss level for each internal game) such as extending the level to 6 minutes in length, turning off order timers, making it harder to burn food, ect.



Oh oh! Another good one, I loves playing this with my niblings, and even got it to play with my s.o., it's called *""Unraveled 2""*.  
You co-op (or single player) strong puppets and have to work together to get past levels.

The themes of existentialism are heavy hitting and might put some people off, but I love that shit. The french weirdness is endearing and a breath of fresh air from stale American garbage. The combat is actually pretty intense if you are the type to punish yourself on missing parry's, it's Sekiro levels of engagement in some of the boss fights. I loved it. But you can spec your characters so parrying isn't something you bother doing anymore... But you should parry cos it's freaking awesome.

mo4jc94,1k3rktw,reddit,"So far I like it. It definitely needs more skirmish maps and bigger, and the way the ""Not NOD"" faction works is a little wonky feeling with the way they build buildings and harvest.

My only other criticism might come from me having not played a C&C like game in many years but the AI difficulty curve is a little extreme. 

My friend and I tried out the multiplayer and we did a 2v2 skirmish, against Easy AI we built up and then steam rolled the enemies with little resistance aside from the first 10-15 mins while the AIs were constantly probing and attacking our bases. 

We tried a second match against Normal AI while executing better starting strategies to build up quicker and get defenses rolling quick... And we got completely fucking obliterated by an absolute zerg swarm of units 10 minutes into the game. 

We each had about 20-25 units and 10 or so buildings and had earned 25-37K credits. 

By that time the AIs had built 6-8x as many units, buildings, and 5-6x our credits earned and absolutely steamrolled us while taking almost no losses. 

It was a baffling huge leap in difficulty and while I can't say for sure the AI was doing ""classic AI cheats"" of not being constrained by the economy, but it does feel like the AI was able to perfectly execute with hundreds of APMs, every single credit they produced was instantaneously used to expand their bases and armies non stop. I've played RTSs since the 90s and this was definitely the hardest ass kicking I've ever taken from an AI and it wasnt even on hard, lmao.

They also stacked their armies and singled out the best units and buildings to kill first, it was impressive how well executed and quick it came down on us, we each had like previously stated around 20-25 units ready and all of a sudden my buddy gets rolled in on by literally 200+ units that immediately targeted all of his defenses, power production, and harvesters. His entire base was gone in about 75 seconds.

Under two minutes later that swarm as well as another one hit my base from two sides and I was gone in a flash as well.",2025-04-20 17:58:30,2,Crintor,gaming

As for games being geared towards frustration, you might just be playing bad games.

mln28p7,1jsek6g,reddit,"hot take:  despite increased compute power and fidelity in gaming, we're on a downhill slide, and the gaming experience has never been worse.

* consoles no longer come with games, let alone physical media.
* cost of entry is multiple car payments worth of cash.
* despite wider acceptance, gaming seems to be becoming more of a single player experience; consoles seem to only come with a single controller (I only have experience with xbox), entire consoles are devoted to single-player gaming (any handheld device for the last \~20 yrs).  
* multiplayer gaming is almost exclusively a network connected event with random personalities (RIP Splitscreen / lan play).
* games are seeming geared less towards fun/challenge/adventure mechanics and more towards frustration (less forgiving)/paywall/grind time mechanics.
* game complexity has reached a point almost requires you to be neurodivergent to play.   Now days, your gamepad has more buttons than you have fingers, each button can have multiple functionalities (press, double press, long press, etc), don't forget combos, combo breakers, counter moves, and/or shifted form/weapon combos.   Just learning the controls of a game now days requires a manual/tutorial screen study (and that's just action games.. lol).  It used to be you could just pick up a controller, mash buttons and figure it out.. good luck doing that today.   Not saying complexity is bad, just that games are a lot harder to approach casually.

My first games were pokemon crystal, Zelda oot, and Mario 64, only one of which I completed, and mostly for the fun instead of the story. No, I think the game that fits this answer best for me would probably be Shadow of the Colossus. 

A love story, about overcoming any obstacle to save the girl [the protagonist] loves. He rides on horseback with her still fresh body to the forbidden lands, where an ancient and dark god has been locked away by his ancestors. Arriving at the temple, the people chasing him long since abandoned the effort and turned around, he is greeted by a voice with no body, his request shall be granted, but first this dark deitys power must be restored. Roaming across the lands are 13 guardians, each a living key to the locks that bind it. The hero must travel across these lands with his horse, Agro, and fight these colossi to free the god, and revive his lover.

I was in 4th or 5th grade. By this point, I mostly played Nintendo games and licensed games (spongebob, fairly odd parents, rocket power, Lego, etc.). When I booted up Kingdom Hearts for the first time, my mind was blown from the opening cutscene alone.

The themes of friendship, darkness in the heart, and overcoming that darkness really stuck with me. The ending cutscene to this day always makes me tear up, especially when Kairi sees the addition Sora did with the cave drawing. I remember immediately needing to get the second game. It was probably my first obsession with video games as well. I used to download Kingdom Hearts podcasts on iTunes just to listen to lore, theories, and news of more sequels (imagine my surprise when I couldn't play ANY of the sequels after KH2).

I don't care how absurd or hard to follow the Kingdom Hearts story gets, I'm always going to be a fan, even if I don't play the games. The game opened my mind to so much, not just with video games but with life.",2025-04-05 07:36:19,1,Neoxxous,gaming

After Robotnik's theft and the instant ""team up"" of Sonic and Knuckles, I felt bad for Knuckles after he was betrayed, immediately helped you with the last of his strength, and then laid there wounded and breathing heavily.

I can't be sure what my ""real"" answer is though. Could be Star Fox 64, any of the Zeldas on Gameboy/SNES/N64, StarCraft, Diablo 2, Pokemon Red, FF8...  Mystical Ninja starring Goemon...

mlrgsen,1jt4i3a,reddit,"atleast 95% of dialogue options in games are pointless, if not more.

Even BG3 for all its varied path also has plenty of dialogue that has no real impact what you pick.

There are plenty of arguments for having dialogue choices that ""doesnt matter"" spread out over dialogue

* Realism, its not just one person monologuing but actually a conversation, you complain that there is a choice but alot of games ONLY speaks when you speak as a choice, if that is the case then yeah you need it
* Breathing room,  Rather than realism its more so a way to let people have time to think about and comprehend what they were just told, instead of again getting a long spiel of exposition, 
* Personal Agency, since you included something as broad as ""It doesnt affect what happens next"" this can include all dialogue which can shape how you see your character even if it doesnt necessarily change what happens next, i think best example comes in recent game ""Eternal Strands"" where you are trapped with your travelling group in a magic dome thing and when they look to you to say something it has things like ""x dialogue (Inspiring Hope), Y dialogue (Stop complaints), Z dialogue (appeal to adventerous spirit)"" it doesnt change stuff but i can shape easily how you see yours.
* An easy extension of WORTHWHILE uses of dialogue wheel, not every single thing you say has to be a choice of extreme good and evil, sometimes you can inquire about more information if you are curious, and again since the dialogue is often multiple choices in a conversation it makes sense to have 2 or 3 options per above to get to ""next part"" and then 1 or 2 options for more information.

Sounds to me like you want a game without dialogue options, which is fine, but i cant keep my eyes open to those long slogs of reading text for 30 minutes in JRPGs as they just talk about nothing, despite reading for fun daily, atleast with choices its gives breathing room and kinda refocusing moments.",2025-04-06 21:17:19,23,ZoulsGaming,gaming
mlrx82h,1jt4i3a,reddit,"I mean if the choice is between having no interaction or having an illusory choice, i think the illusory choice is better. Having options isn't imo just about the result, but also about making the choice itself. \*Of course\* it's better to have a real consequence and meaning for the choice, but that takes considerable dev time, depending on how much it affects the story, keeping track of branching of decisions, the extra voicelines for various outcomes, testing etc. Yeah it sucks when a game pretends your choices matter and you find out they don't, but when it's something simple just for the immersion then i'm all for it. For example i enjoyed all the 'dialogue' choices in ghost of tsushima, even when it was obvious that it doesn't matter if Jin is thinking about Yuna or his uncle when he's taking a bath etc, or when Judy in Cyberpunk asks how you like your coffee. The outcomes would be exactly the same regardless on what you choose to say, but it adds to the experience for minimal cost imo. So yeah i'd like devs to keep making two or more options even if the difference don't change anything, as long as it's clear which set of choices has actual consequences.",2025-04-06 22:53:55,3,conqeboy,gaming

consistency is an important factor when it comes to having the immersion of player choice; meaningful or not.  
Having meaningless dialogue options helps balance out and emphasize the real choices that have an effect on the story or game.

Even better (and rarer) is if picking 'no' ends the game right there and sends you to credits.

mltaslj,1jt4i3a,reddit,"You're looking behind the curtain, although the examples you gave is a very poorly written version.

So, in most story based games, you're GOING to need to get to the end of the story. You may get to choose a few tidbits along the way, but ultimately, you're going to be driven to the final showdown with Big Bag Evil Guy on Emotional Payoff Mountain. A basic game would write the one line of story and get you there the exact same way every time. A decent RPG will make you THINK your choices matter even when you're still being lead through the amusement park ride that is this story.

So what does that mean? Well, poorly written dialogue will force the player to interact with an ""I see"" just cause they have nothing better to offer... But a WELL WRITTEN game might pull more interesting variations like.

>You Wake up in a small room with someone watching you from the corner

>1: Who are you?  
2: Where Am I  
3: What's going on?

>Person in the corner goes on to answer all three questions in one statement regardless of which you've chosen.

Unless you're paying close attention to how you played last time, most people won't think ""Wait she's saying the exact same dialogue"" most people will just hear her answering their questions and feel engaged with the conversation. The choice may not mean anything, but giving the player agency to make choices and feel like the world is responding to their choices is more important than the not-choice.

Players won't be able to make RADICAL choices that change the ending aside from the  2-4ish endings provided, but you're going to be making HUNDREDS of dialogue choices. If you KNOW there's only 4 endings, and that you're being led to one of them from the start, your choices won't feel like they matter, sure. But if you go in and get all these choices, you're going to feel like the story naturally evolved around you.

Some of them do it for extra dialog though. Like if you chose the more ‘curious’ choice you get the character to explain the information more.

If every answer mattered and had branching consequences you'd never leave the starting zone and every plot for such a game would be a 1 hour story where you get to explore every possible branch.

And for most people it would be a 1 hour game. The vast majority of people only role play as them selves and make the most enjoyable choice the first time. Replaying a game for inferior choices does not appeal to them.

If you want a grand epic full of choices and consequences with the length of Baldur's Gate 3 (let's not delude our selves, the game it's mostly the same except for 2-3 big choices and dozens of small variations that don't affect the main plot) it would take decades to make, billions of $ and it would release already obsolete on nearly every gameplay and technological level.

Those of us who got hooked ran out to buy the other 5 and later, spear of destiny series, and so on.  This would have been about 1991.  There was an older 2d game, hence the 3d distinction in the program name.

  
Your shout outs echo the original design.  The devs commented back in the day that it was about fast paced gameplay with simple controls.  

If you just want mindless killing of nazis you can also try sniper elite series, 4 & 5 are solid.

Huge replayability honestly. Both in terms of the story, and the mechanics. There is a broad ""good all the time"" and ""bad all the time"" but a lot more complexity based on when you pick which choice. There's also Durge which adds another level to the story and set of endings. So to see (almost) everything that's theoretically 4 runs.

After you beat tactician, honor mode starts calling. There are 12 classes and you're generally using 4 at a time, and also multiclassing. There are a lot of strong builds with 2 or 3 classes.

mo3z5rj,1k3l0ac,reddit,"* Orcs Must Die series. Most of the levels can be beat in under 30 minutes and as you go along you unlock new traps or maybe trap upgrades. I forget about the first two titles, but the third one has an endless mode where you just face off against increasing numbers and stronger orcs, so you could always start a session like that, play for however long you have, then quit. 
* Stardew Valley is another one. Each game day is like 7 minutes or something, with auto-saves at the end of each day, and with all the mods it has virtually infinite replay potential. 
* If you liked Borderlands, the BioShock series might be up your alley. 
* The Deadly Tower of Monsters is a really well done indie game that will likely have you chuckling quite a bit as you play 
* Saints Row 2. Most of the missions don't take too long and it's an open world game so if you're short on time you can just play some of the mini games. Plus the radio commercials are just <chef's kiss> perfectly done parodies. Only problem is the PC version crashes like... all the time. One of the former devs spent a lot of time trying to fix things as best they could without access to the source code and made the Gentlemen of the Row mod, but sadly they lost a battle with cancer a few years ago. Saints Row 3 is a better game in every technical way, but it came at the expense of the game's soul.

mo43n8h,1k3l0ac,reddit,"The Monster Hunter series are action RPGs that use a mission structure. When you play, you select a quest and then deploy onto a closed map to complete the objective. Usually the objective is to kill a large 'boss' monster that freely wanders around the map. Along the way you encounter smaller monsters and items you can gather up to craft useful things like potions. 

The combat can be compared to fighting games or Dark Souls. Some weapons are slower or faster, but all require you to commit to animations. The monsters are much larger than you, and will send you flying with each hit. These are heavily skill-based games, focused identifying openings and choosing the right position. 

There is always a time limit of no more than fifty minutes, so it will never take longer than that to finish. In practice, even thirty minutes is a fairly long clear time. Fifteen is about what one expects if you are doing something that you're prepared for. 

The games allow 4-player co-op for most of the content, but everything is doable by yourself.

You mention a bus stop, so I assume this is a mobile device. 

If it's a Steam Deck, I'd go with *Rise*. 

If it's a Switch, I'd go with *Generations*. 

If it's a Phone, I'd emulate *Freedom Unite* on PPSSPP. 

For the sheer amount of content, Generations wins without a doubt. Personally, I emulate it with a 60fps patch. You could probably manage it on a steam deck.",2025-04-20 16:36:42,0,Treestheyareus,gaming

Monster hunter rise (pretty much all platforms), very easy to jump in and play, but isn't exactly an rpg. World and wilds also exist but they're a bit harder to jump into (until you reach the postgame anyway) as they have lots more focus on story and exploration, you know stuff that takes time.

mobyoap,1k4pw6m,reddit,"The end of Robo's sidequest in Chrono Trigger. For a few reasons.

After a brief camp scene where they all talk about Robo's four centuries of tireless work and the suggestion that they're all being guided by some sort of Entity, they talk about things they'd like to change with the power that time travel gives them. Lucca dismisses the idea, but there's definitely something there.

Cut to later that night. Lucca wakes up. The Time Gate music fades in, progressing beyond the two seconds we're usually limited to and into a warbling, oscillating nightmare soundscape. She wanders into a clearing to find a Time Gate. She activates it. It's RED instead of blue. Already this is incredibly unsettling.

She arrives in her house, some time in the past. And if you've been paying attention, it hits you. She's here to save her mother from being crippled in an freak domestic/industrial accident.

You can do it, but if you fail, you're punished by being forced to relive the entire thing, complete with a ghastly 16-bit scream after the smash to black.

It's such a small moment in the grand scheme of things, but the incredibly high, deeply relatable human stakes of the scene and the haunting way it's presented has really stuck with me for the last thirty years.",2025-04-21 22:16:20,33,Fievel10,gaming

moc38p2,1k4pw6m,reddit,"Zombies in the Timesplitters games generally gave me the creeps, especially the ones in the Siberia, Notre Dame and Haunted Mansion levels. There’s a section in Future Perfect where you fight waves of zombies who’re seemingly delivered to the room via these large metal chutes that then deposit them onto surgical tables. You can hear the bodies making their way down the chutes before they appear and reanimate. It’s messed up and unnerving, and undoubtedly gave me nightmares when I was young.

The original Urban Chaos is quite a creepy one, if only because it begins as quite a generic police story but then develops into an investigation into the occult with literal doomsday magic taking place. The PS1 graphics also give the game an incredibly unnerving and claustrophobic atmosphere. 

Oni was also great game which unnerved me. It’s the level in which you fight an organic brain that has become a supercomputer. The brain is trying to post photographs of itself onto the online web and you need to shut it down, all the while the brain is talking about how beautiful it is. Again, messed up.

(As I’m writing this, I’m realising how 90s and early 00s games have a monopoly on the unnerving.)

Finally, I just want to mention two more games Jak and Daxter; for the suspenseful music when you jumped in the water and then got eaten by a huge fish. Secondly, the original American McGee’s Alice. That game is unnerving in general, but I remember thinking that the March Hare and Dormouse being grafted into mechanical contraptions was truly macabre.",2025-04-21 22:42:14,3,Erlana,gaming

And I believe the Bottom of the Well was evidence of violence perpetrated by the royal family's allies? I can't really remember.  But I don't think it was meant to be Ganondorf. It was like this nightmarish insight into the ambivalence of cruelty. People from both 'sides' can perpetrate it.

mod41wm,1k4pw6m,reddit,"Playing Runescape as a kid and doing an early game quest, A Soul's Bane, where you enter a rift full of emotion-based enemies to search for a child.

The first level was based on Anger, somewhat like Hell. Fire everywhere. Unable to damage enemies normally. Weird, but okay.

The next level though? The level based on Fear? You had to search dark tunnels for a way out and the game would jumpscare you *sometimes* with a Grim Reaper type of enemy flying out of the tunnel and attacking you. Scared the shit out of me.

The 3rd level was based on Confusion, and you could only damage one specific enemy. The rest were invincible.

4th level was Hopelessness, and every time you killed an enemy, it just regenerated as a slightly weaker version until it was gone.

The final floor shows that the boy has been warped into a 3 headed hydra monster and lashes out at his father that came to rescue him. And then the quest reward was like, 500gp or something equally useless. Very odd choice for such an early game quest.

And then like 15 years later, they added some lore to the surrounding area about a hydra god Loarnab that was killed by the god Zaros, and how Loarnab was so powerful that his corpse was used as a divine battery, and his presence lingered. So the implications was that this 8 year old boy was taken over by the lingering spirit of a vengeful monster god that died hundreds of years ago.

This needs little explenation for those who have not played control. In Control there is this Ashtray maze. Its everchanging maze, but you cant get through it until specific part of story. If you enter maze, you will always return to entrance. And control on it self is eerie game, with no music, just ambient sounds. You slowly gain superpowers like flying, object throwing, mind control, shields etc.

Now, in later part of the game, you need to get through that maze, so you need to ask specific person how to do it. Im avoiding spoilers as much as i can here. Once you get to that character, you get specific item that helps you. Suddenly heavy metal starts playing (there is a reason for it in game), you can get through maze. Now starts coming into power moment. You can unleash all your powers and game throws hordes of enemies at you in ever changing trippy maze while heavy metal (songs name is Old Gods of Asgard - Take Control ) is blasting in background.

Open world etc but what they dont Tell you that Theres areas you shouldnt Go to in the beginning cause youre to weak. Nothing hints that to you. Enemies still Look the Same, areas Look as peacefull as can be and than you die over and over again. Thats Just frustrating. But thats Not all...

Games Like Fallout Just do it better. First you fight Off roaches and Rats with a BB gun. Than you Encounter dogs, Raiders, bigger enemies with better weapons, Armor and stuff. And when you Encounter a deathclaw and only have a BB gun in your Hand you know you got No Business in that area yet. 

In Atomfall i got my Shotgun and Just stumbled in the Main Story Main hub by accident. After about 20 minutes in the Game ive been in the end Game Underground Bunker. I feel Like i shouldnt have been let in there so early. I felt stupid for Not having any suspense left. You rob the Players of the Journey to uncover anything. The Rest from there is Just boring fetch quests to get the MC guffins to Open the 5 Doors you need to Open. 

Again, Fallout... Imagine in Fallout 4 after 20 minutes you beam into the Institute and find your son and basically have nothing left to uncover. Just your son telling you to do stupid fetch quests for him. 

I dont know how or why they could Miss that Point. Now its Like the OP Said. Now i Just feel obligated to Finish because i already know what is coming, but have to do boring, tedious fetch quests and than i'll be relieved If i finally finished it.

mkn921c,1jnvnuc,reddit,Everyone is entitled to a opinion and I'm sorry it wasn't your cup of tea. I gave it a 7/10 I'll explain why. Most of the reason you didn't like it was why I did.Its not like any other games I've played honestly.I love the fact there's no currency you have to trade items or barter very few games do that. I thought combat was good not great but it was challenging enough so I enjoyed it. I had no problem with stealth either. As long as you find grass or bushes to hide in you can be inches from someone and they won't see you. Now that doesn't always work out I get it but you can usually always spot the enemies well before they see you and I would act accordingly and find my place to hide watch their pathing and then take them out one by one.Especially once I got a bow one headshot takes him down even with a non upgraded bow. I played on default level I'm not sure if you were higher than that or not but I thought the difficulty with good for default. And if you do enjoy the game there's plenty of replayability since you can choose between quite a few allies to escape with and get different endings. plus once you figure out what you have to do and what you have to go I've seen people speed running this game very quickly so you can fly through to get the other endings with different allies once you had your fill.I'm on my second playthrough now and still enjoying it. That may get old soon but so far it hasn't. But as of now I only plan on finishing this playthrough because I still haven't finished kcd2 or a.c shadows and south of Midnight's right around the corner. But my guess is once I finish my second I will eventually go back for a third playthrough cuz it's the perfect length imo. I think the game is worth playing but I'm not saying it's some some masterpiece. But again these are just my opinions and I'm not trying to convince you otherwise with the experience that you had just my 2 cents. I always appreciate hearing someone else's point of view And although I disagree I thought you were being fair and genuine about your experience. That's a lot more than I can say for some other people who just hate simply for the fact to hate certain games. So I appreciate your honest review.,2025-03-31 06:25:44,8,BlazeGawd7,gaming

Even big studios known for quality have given really sub-par offerings as of late (looking at you BGS with your half-baked Starfield release.. and I love BGS prior to SF).

Pretty graphics and dialogue trees don't make a game good. I need game mechanics that give meaning to what I'm doing.

I’ll agree that combat feels tough and isn’t getting easier. I get the sense the design is meant to dissuade you from trying to solo an enemy camp, but rather pick your battles. To be fair, enemies are totally willing to let you walk if you don’t confront them or move into their area, so I’ve taken to avoiding fights unless I really need to, and rolling in with buffs and throwables.
I’m running into a bug where sound will cut out that’s annoying. I’m hoping they fix that before next weekend when I’ll have more time to play.

Game appears complicated but it's extremely shallow. I can't pick anything new from the material since i'm always at full capacity, i can't buy new recipes since traders are so stingy they want my entire inventory to get a single nade schematics. How about no? My inventory is always full and you will never know when you get hit too much and be forced to live with half of your hp for who knows how long (as you can only craft 4 bandages with full mats).",2025-03-31 13:32:51,8,corinarh,gaming
mkn2qrm,1jnvnuc,reddit,"I think it's quite the opposite. It's deep and rewarding. Killing enemies does not provide exp, because the narrative is, that you can also avoid them, to get to your objective. You have to always check your surroundings before you engage. There's always a route that you can take to avoid combat, especially if there's a number of enemies that would be too difficult to fight off. 
Combat is not janky at all, it's a bit basic, but quite well done. In a firefight, if you don't have cover you're not gonna last very long. Also if two enemies attack you head on it's gonna be difficult.

Minimap is the compass guide on top. I would honestly disable that as well. Its a lot more fun to check the coordinates and orientate yourself on the actual map, while the game is running in the background. The game is not going to hold your hand at all, it's difficult only because of that.

Weapons get in better quality once you repair them. They do not jam as much whilst reloading. I would love to see more about that honestly. If a weapon is lower tier, it should misfire and jam even during the action. 

There is no real experience gained in the game, but you tend to search for combat stims and magazines with which you expand your skills. I think it's a very neat idea for an exploration game. 

Also the leads system, you'll be reading a lot more about the story of the game than before, because it entails clues of the next cache or the next mechanic that will open up some of the areas of the game. 

Comparing all of this to some of the previous games like Fallout or Stalker, to which the game is often compared to, because of the setting. I'd say Atomfall is a solid 9/10 and a great competitor.",2025-03-31 05:24:39,11,0ygn,gaming

mmw8w7x,1jnvnuc,reddit,"I beg to differ on combat and stealth.

Idk if it was the patch that fixed stealth or not, but enemies don't see me that easily and takedowns are only noticeable when the person is 5 or less meters away (which does make sense cuz realistically, takedowns aren't actually as quiet as you'd think.). What lacks in the combat is the melee mostly, no block and no parry is pretty off-putting for melee, but I didn't actually mind it too much. My main problem with the game is the lack of interactivity, you can't talk with everybody like in Fallout or Stalker, and you can't engage in a conversation like in STALKER. There is also no reputation system, which I would've loved. If I worked with Protocol, I would've been a traitor to the villagers and they'd refuse to barter with me, and comment on me negatively. Also the fact I can't be on the side of outlaws, I remember you could actually be friends with the bandits in Stalker. So TLDR, interactivity is poor in this game. There is no day/night cycle in the game which also makes me feel off, I would understand if it'd be a linear story game, but it's not.

The story is nice, haven't finished it, and I wouldn't care about the ending so much if it was mediocre (of course that's my personal preference, I like story inclusion, but i'm most keen on exploration and gameplay)

Also idk what you mean by three buttons for a map, just press M. That's the basics of open world games, map = M.

But all on all, i can't complain on the game compared to price, as I did buy an account for 80 percent off the original price, but yes, the cons are at large considering world-building.

  
I hope they patch some of these things, as of now, it's not actually that bad as they say, it's all on personal preference, try it out.",2025-04-13 13:52:49,2,bruhguy346,gaming
mkr9gfo,1jnvnuc,reddit,"For me, I can get on board with a lot of things in this game.

I kind of like the fact that combat isn't meant to be the focus, that survival is the primary focus - low ammo count etc.

The lack of available weapons makes a lot of sense - Cumbria isn't exactly bristling with firearms, single shot weapons like rifles and shotguns, the odd pistol, are genuinely about all you'd get.

The thing that pisses me off the most though is the stealth - it feels so half-baked it's not even funny. Even on the lowest setting, enemies can zero in on you from half a mile away if you so much as peek a hair out of the tall grass.

If your game is not going to allow me to tank many hits, that's fine, but give me a way to *avoid* those hits.

Five of the approaching die in the fire as they stand there unsure of what to do. Advance forward, loot their bodies and take their piddly little .22 and ammo.

Think of the original movies and stories. He's not really fighting villains one on one. He's fighting crimes. Protecting innocents. 


So think of it as problem solving combat. 


There's a bank robbery. They've been planning it. They have bombs, guns, hostages, escape routes, etc.


You bust in on it, whether as a mission based game or open world with events(some scripted planned crimes and some generated crimes of opportunity). Switches to playing like Superhot. But you're using your powers of speed, vision, breath, and strength to both stop the crime and keep civilians safe. Also don't kill the criminals, you can't just laser their face.


They of course shoot at you, it's what criminals do. But that's just for the atmosphere. You're not there to protect a health bar. Humans are fragile, you are not. 


So make sure bystanders don't get hit. Stop the robbery. Stop the getaway car. Diffuse the bomb, or fly away with it. Stop the bio weapon.

That said, the fun parts of Superman are in the decisions, morality, story, and mythos he can bring.

mnvhz6s,1k2mzpc,reddit,"I disagree with a lot of people in this thread who say that it’d be boring because superman is completely invincible/invulnerable to everything except kryptonite (this isn’t true).

I reckon it’d be very doable. Make it about superman AND Clark Kent. Prologue is as Superman is moving out of home on the farm to move to Metropolis. 

You have to do some quests/missions for the daily prophet (take photos, interview people, etc) for which you have to stay in disguise. Could be a sort of stealth mechanic where you can only use your powers while not in view of others. Plot thread is building up your resume as a reporter.

Then some actual superman missions. Have the fortress of solitude/antarctica be a legit area with various places to explore and things to find (maybe old kryptonian ships a la man of steel). Let him set up his own fortress and have it populate with items from completed quests. 

Have Metropolis be set up like in Spiderman PS4 with both larger story quests as well as smaller random quests. Add a few classic villains as well as one larger villain. Maybe use the story from Superman: Birthright as the overarching plot with Lex Luthor as the villain.

Add a few linear levels outside of that (e.g. military bases/LexCorp facilities/the phantom zone). Maybe even a flashback level of Jor-El and Lara-El helping their son escape Krypton.

Skill tree progression is easy to make work with the story since he’s a new hero and has only just picked up the mantle. Having new ways of using his strength/heat vision/flight plays well into the story. You could also have a smaller reporter skill tree for Clark Kent which would make it easier to spot clues/take photos/solve cases/write better stories.

Cosmetics/outfits would be easy as well. There’s so many iconic looks to choose from from comics, film, and TV. Classic Chris reeves version, comic book versions, Snyder version, black and white version, injustice version. Heaps to choose from.

mn1kgty,1jyoqyx,reddit,"I'm not really sure what I would call it, but I wouldn't call it cyberpunk.

I have a hard time considering anything to be cyberpunk that doesn't involve extensive modification/augmentation of the human body through technology. It's kind of a crucial, dare I say *necessary* theme of the genre. Cyberpunk without augmentation is like a western without guns.

Also, some of those themes you listed are patently NOT things that define cyberpunk lol. Like youth rebellion - that's a YA dystopia thing, not necessarily a cyberpunk thing. Cel-shaded art also has nothing to do with the genre of cyberpunk.

The other consistent theme with cyberpunk is that people are always dehumanized in some way. In worlds like Blade Runner, you kinda see that across the board. People in general are just kind of living in squalor. In games like Deus Ex, you see it manifest mostly in the form of amplifying existing biases, i.e. active and legal segregation in society between ""augs"" and ""normals"".

Jet Set Radio has an anarchistic or ""punk"" aesthetic going on, and it is somewhat anti-corporate since you are going around spray painting graffiti, but that's about where the similarities end. The main conflict in the game isn't even with corporations - it's with rival gangs.",2025-04-14 11:15:17,3,magicscreenman,gaming

 You could even up the difficulties if you wanted whenever swapping.

Also shoutout to Bioshock 2's DLC Minerva's Den, still the best dlc I've ever played.

mnzw7dz,1k2si0i,reddit,"Weirdly in the same situation and I’m
Always looking  for suggestions.

 I honestly think these games are great for spending hours playing together even if you’re the one with the controller:

- Blue Prince (very much a mystery which you could spend hours and hours working together, talking about and progressing)

- The Return of the Obra Din - I see it’s been recommended already, this was one of our first games we played together and really got her in to gaming a little more, the progression is so fun and when you feel like you’re getting somewhere it feels so good to enjoy it together.

- Outer Wilds, a little like Blue prince, a lot of repetition, repeating days, but a lot of talking to each other and throwing ideas out there, what to do, where to go. If you’ve not played it it is so so worth it.

- Unheard, this is a hell of a game which is so unique, you have to solve a murder, mystery just through people’s voices, highly recommend

- Twelve minutes - really good game with a similar repeat the day until you figure things out but the slow progression is really enjoyable and there’s plenty of those “ohhh yes!” Moments

Spiritfarer - bit of a different one as this can technically be a co-op game where one person plays as the cat, we really enjoyed this for a little bit of a mystery but really it was all about the emotion and story. 

Look them up, see if you think they’ll match and if you do, let me know! Would love to hear people’s opinions!",2025-04-19 22:06:44,1,Pjpg,gaming

Arma 3 promises to be less of a technical headache with even more variety. The only downside is it is an older title. So I'm sure plenty of its user base ended up in Reforger.

ml0gcg8,1jphpp9,reddit,"Dyson Sphere Program.

Setting up my wrap technology, go to snother system and make a system only to green science.  This might take a few days.

Between this I need to upgrade my assembling machines to mk2 or maybe mk3 if I can get them soon bc mk1 is 75% of the speed.  Mk2 is 100% and mk3 125%. So it will be an increase of 2/3 from mk1 to mk3 reducing the number of machines needed.

After that and getting all my green upgrades, get a system which only goal is to produce some science at an alarming speed. Maybe I'll start with 360/m of each.

mky8f0e,1jpblhq,reddit,"Open world games. I do better with metroidvania style worlds or linear games unless it‘s Sandbox like Factorio which has a somewhat linear progression if you break it down into steps.

Not that I think they‘re bad - the sheer amount of choice overstimulates me to a point where I can‘t really find it fun.

I‘m also very bad at wayfinding.

These points together just make the whole „pick a direction and go“ thing very difficult to me.

Elder Scrolls works because Elder Scrolls is mostly a hyperfixation on the lore for me (god I wish Bethesda was… not Bethesda). And in general games where I have a clearly established personal objective if the game doesn‘t provide one.

I guess this might also be because I‘m generally bad at structuring tasks for myself?

But I do like Factorio… huh.

It's extremely mindless, but almost in a meditative/zen way.  There's pretty minimal music, so it's primarily the sound of the pressure washer spraying and when you're tackling the bigger jobs, where you're spraying almost non-stop for 40 minutes...you can really empty your mind and zone out.

Also Stardew Valley, if you just play it by your own pace, and don't watch the online videos on ""meta"" and minmaxing stuff like people nowadays somehow do in all games... I find SV very relaxing, casual and fun. And you don't need sound there as well (even tho soundtrack is very nice!), but you can easily listen to something else while playing.

Also in case you're into any of those genres or want to try out: turn based strategy games (for me personally Rome Total War) , or city builders ( for me Cities Skylines ) are also great games that are not too intense and you don't need to have full focus on them while playing, you can casually listen to stuff along while playing and play at your own pace mostly. (I do think Cities Skylines get's a bit more intense with time as your city grows into a freakin' metropolis or a whole country, so there's a lot more to manage)",2025-04-18 07:46:50,1,PixelPiso,gaming

Because it’s so fast paced I sometimes end up playing all day cause it’s enough to keep my adhd brain happy from the amount of content I can switch between, and I’m always making progress somewhere. Even the hard things I’d give up on at first eventually become attainable goals cause I get stronger by doing other things. And if anything, I can always trade for stuff if I’m lazy cause the premium currency, platinum, is tradeable and I can farm easier stuff to trade for the platinum to buy/trade for what I really want. 

Oh yeah and the game is entirely free. I don’t have to pay one cent on it if I didn’t want to. Did I mention the story is so amazing it’s hard to believe it’s from a game that has nothing but a select few cosmetics locked behind a paywall? It’s seriously ridiculous that this game is completely free, to the point where you buy platinum (usually with the frequent generous discounts on your daily login rewards) just cause the devs deserve it.

They're not ""obsolete"" in the sense that... these CD-ROMS are probably the only piece of media that these particular games have ever been released in. These kinds of games are very unlikely to have been released digitally on Steam for example. They're just not popular or relevant to the majority of gamers today.

mkvlyv0,1joxuwt,reddit,"Platforming. Even in non-platformer games with bad platforming sections. I wouldn't say ""cake"", as I can sometimes feel the amount of calculating my brain is doing keeping track of the physics of the jump, timing of the moving platforms, the motion of the camera\*, etc, and I'll let out a sigh of relief after every tricky jump. My girlfriend says I be looking hella stressed doing them. But I guess its that my brain is capable of actively and clearly reading the necessary information and discerning the necessary calculations.

In almost every other type of gaming challenge, there's a certain amount of ""leap of faith"" decision making going on with every decision I make, if that makes sense? There's a degree of fuzzy logic going on, I guess maybe because my brain doesn't feel confident enough in its grasp of all the variables to calculate everything precisely, so it doesn't try to calculate everything, and at a certain point just sort of turns off and ""lets Jesus take the wheel"" so to speak, leaving it to my reflexes and to chance. But with platformers its different. In some ways its harder on my brain—because my brain is capable of reading all the information IT DOES, and so is turned all the way on; platformers are my favorite genre but its honestly hard for me to find ones that I can leisurely enjoy nowadays, as they are usually on either side of being either too easy to stimulate me, or just hard enough to give my brain a workout (after a full day of work and school when I'd rather let it rest).

Its intuitive but not untaxing.

\*thinking about it and putting it into words for the first time, this might explain why I've never understood reviewers criticizing 3D platformers for their difficult camera controls—I guess I've just filtered it as being part of the challenge?

King of the Bridge is a funny little ""chess"" game where you are trying to cross a bridge but the bridge troll challenges you to 10th Edition Advanced Troll Chess. It's basically chess with a bunch of house rules that you don't know until you accidentally cheat which triggers rule 0 (when a player cheats, their opponent can cheat as payback) and the goblin immediately kills your king. So by trial and error you learn the rules and eventually win, it took me about an hour, which is fine for a $3 game.

It's like top-down terraria where you fight a bunch of bosses and in-between each boss you go mining and exploring for upgrades that'll prepare you for the next boss. We both played Terraria so it was super intuitive. The progression system is great, there are tons of things you can build, everything is super intuitive and exploration is very rewarding. Only downside I've found so far is that some bosses don't have a clear location, you kinda just have to walk around and explore in random directions to find it which can take 10 minutes or an hour. There's also equipment degradation, which I understand when it comes to armor to punish you for taking damage or dying but tool degradation is unnecessary in a game like this imo.",2025-04-09 20:46:23,1,NokraVT,gaming

There is also Holdfast, napoleonic era pvp shooter with 150 people on server. Its super janky with Mount and Blade melee combat, 14 second reloads, inaccurate smoothbore muskets but it somehow works. Its definitely a unique experience, there are some tryhards but most people are just having fun. Voice chat is a big part of the game, mostly to meme and spam weird music. Best way to play is to find some officer with active voice chat and follow him around, due to the nature of the weaponry a single player can't go on a killing spree (unless he's one of the veteran tryhards) and coordination and teamwork is key.

Massive community, huge lobby rooms for a game of this type, almost like a MMO lite. It's a good grind and will easily get your money's worth.

Another recommendation would be Earth Defense Force 6, Deep Rock Galactic, Helldivers 2, as well as older Monster Hunter titles like Rise/Sunbreak, and World/Iceborne.

FFXIV, its a singleplayer game before its an MMO tbh, its a very social game and you can do dungeons either with NPCS or real people depends on what you want. Also the PVP is quite decent, there are thousands of hours of content also you can play the game for free until the 3rd expansion so you are not losing anything. 

I suggested FFXIV because my brother just started playing it after playing shooter and competitive games all his life and he’s enjoying alot so maybe it could do the same for you.

mm0ms0q,1juaz7m,reddit,"Bayonetta has really cool battle tracks throughout all 3 games. They're all moon related too.

A more niche pick would be Brutal Legend, an action/strategy game with a 100% heavy metal soundtrack. There are some classic tracks in there, and Ozzy Osborne himself upgrades your car/guitar.

If you like classical music, I can only recommend Eternal Sonata, which is a fairytale RPG that features piano suites from Chopin as well as his biography. A real hidden gem, the bossfights are no joke.

My personal favorite is still Need for Speed Most Wanted though. So many good songs.

**Hades** & **Hades II**, both have excellent songs as soundtracks.

mkx3cpd,1jp5859,reddit,"I call them ""Mind Hack"" games, to go along with my ""Fast Track"" priority games and my ""Laid Back"" games. Whenever I talk about my system of organization on Steam, people always ask me what games I keep in my Mind Hack folder.


So, here's the ongoing list of Mind Hack games that I keep rolling around:

Terraria: It's Terraria. If you don't know it, it's a 2D Survival Crafter like Minecraft but with a lot more content and bosses to face off against. Has a fantastic soundtrack, but I've heard it enough times to just mute the music to listen to audiobooks and games.

God Eater series: Anime Monster Hunter. There is a story, but there's also a lot of grinding missions that are perfect for multiplayer or just listening to other things. Monster Hunter itself is another good option.

Ink: A silly invisible platformer.

Project Nimbus: An indie Mecha game that has an infinite survival mode. I just cue into that to blow up mechs. I do the same with my Armored Core games, but those are emulated.

Gundam Breaker 4: If you really like giant robots and customization, this one is really good for that. Not for everyone, but is worth it for me.

Synthetik: Hey, hey people. This is a great 2D rouge-like shooter with a satisfying reload mechanic. Fast and brutal.

Tower of Guns: Literally designed for this, it's a basic shooter with powerups meant to be played quickly on a lunch break, and it works well towards that end.

Devil May Cry Bloody Palace: DMC3-5 all have bloody palace mode to practice your move and see if you can complete the whole thing. In my opinion, works great as a fidget toy while you grind Red Orbs.

Star Wars Battlefront Instant Action: Specifically the IA modes of the original.

Street Fighter VI, Soul Calibur VI, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, and other such Fighting gamws: Practice mode and CPU matches are perfect.

Midnight Fight Express: Think Yakuza and the Arkham games blended together. Hi-speed brawling action.

Yakuza 0: The main story is not a Mind Hack game. The mini-games, especially those on the menu, are.

Bloons Tower Defense 6: Not my cup of tea, but someone recommended this as a Mind Hack game in the past, so I have added it to my recommendation.  ",2025-04-01 20:55:02,2,KnightGamer724,gaming

It's not about you taking over a nation (like Civilization). It's about you taking over a family, a dynasty, and ushering it though the Middle Ages. You have heirs and a court as a count, duke, king, emperor, or whoever in Europe to Northern Africa to the Middle East to India to the steppes of Asia (Mongolia and China).

The time reference is the 800's with the Norse/Viking invasions to the late 1400's with the end of the Medieval Ages into the Renaissance.

You grow your land and your power and your vassals through military might, diplomacy such as marriages and birthright, intrigue and secrets or murder, through religious power, or however you want to play.

It's a lot of fun and probably the easiest entry to get into (moreso than CK2).

And you can have and enact all kinds of crazy outcomes.

[Xenoblade Chronicles X](https://youtu.be/20Hb_onhtUU?si=GC8Iz1RzrBO7YRBV) just came out. It’s very Sci Fi. It has a huge open world alien planet to explore (only one planet though). The main story isn’t the focus compared to the trilogy, but the side quests have such amazing world building it is partially forgiven.

The rest of the Xenoblade trilogy is Science Fantasy, mixing fantasy and sci fi visuals, but usually hiding the actual Sci-Fi plot for end game reveals. They have a large focus on exploration but aren’t open world, instead are open areas that are unlocked linearly. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is extremely immersive because of the characters being some of the most realistic I’ve seen written.",2025-04-22 14:46:54,2,PalpitationTop611,gaming
moj2sv1,1k57si7,reddit,"Xenoblade Chronicles X, which was stuck on the Wii U for a decade but recently got a Switch port. The premise is that Earth was destroyed in a battle between two alien empires, and it follows a group of refugees that fled Earth and crashlanded on an alien planet. It's an RPG. Camera is third person, although you can actually zoom in far enough that it becomes de facto first person.

* You're stuck on the one planet, but it's an amazing environment to explore, one of the best open worlds ever made. It has five different biomes and they're all very distinct.
* There's a main hub city that you operate out of. At first it's only home to humans, but as you progress through the game you make contact with new alien races and form alliances with them, and they start immigrating to the city, which leads to all kinds of interesting sidequests and ambient details. They're great aliens, I actually prefer them even to Mass Effect's.
* The worldbuilding is great. Every species of alien wildlife has a bestiary entry talking about its ecology. Every intelligent alien enemy has one talking about their culture. Every robot or vehicle enemy has one detailing its design specs. Also you can just pick up random junk lying around and register it in a ""Collectopedia"" that tells you a bit about it.
* There are different arms manufacturers that you can invest in and level up to get access to better gear. New alien species sometimes bring with them new technologies, so, e.g., if you form an alliance with the Nopon, you get access to their thermal weapons that do extra damage on back attacks.
* Combat emphasizes good tactics and has a lot of viable builds. It's not an action game but it feels satisfying.
* You get to pilot mechs. Transforming mechs. Later you get one that turns into a jet plane and you can fly it around the planet.

There are admittedly two significant weak points. First, the story isn't *bad*, but it's told in a strange way. It feels almost like watching episodes of an old school sci-fi show. A lot of the story is also in the sidequests. It's really important that you do the game's side content.

Second, there's one character who is, frankly, obnoxious. If you can put up with him, though, the rest of the cast are fine.",2025-04-23 00:45:54,2,Galle_,gaming

I kept trying to attack with the triggers and having to toggle lock-on with the dpad is annoying and got me killed a fair amount if there were multiple enemies (I have since read that I should take a much more calculated approach initially as opposed to jumping into uneven fights like a bull in a japan shop). Once I got past the intro I immediately started exploring and got myself stuck on a rock by the beach that I could neither climb up or fall down from. Since I did not have any fast travel points unlocked and it autosaved me on the rocks it seems like I am going to have to play the first hour or so over again.

I realize that 99% of this was user error on my part but also quite frustrating given my limited time for gaming due to work/kids/wife/etc. The game is beautiful no doubt and and I fully intend to jump back in again soon but not a great starting experience lol",2025-04-16 20:12:54,1,RiseUpHunkerDown,gaming

mnmqsys,1k0ddt3,reddit,"Hello everyone.  I’ve encountered a dilemma, and I wonder if someone can help me?



I am a very serious fan of game rankings, and I want to find the most authoritative or widely recognized game rankings and strictly follow the order listed without mixing in any of my own subjective judgments.



I have previously considered:

Metacritic, but it provides a weighted average score based on game media, which doesn’t reflect the players' preferences. In other words, it doesn't show how fun the game really is.

SteamDB, but it only gives the player ratings on games available on the Steam platform.



After a (very long) investigation, I am now considering game databases like RAWG and IGDB that include user ratings. However, I don't know which of these databases is the best, in other words, which one has the most games and the most users. My preliminary research suggests that RAWG is the largest. Is this true? Can its ""All-time Top 250"" be trusted?",2025-04-17 18:45:42,1,NewWrap7131,gaming

The Fallout games do this also but they are not as majestic (for obvious reasons) and lack that “classical” touch. 

There is nothing quite like Jeremy Soul - his music for Mercenaries (1) and Total Annihilation have a similar vibe but aren’t “landscape music”.

I really like Jesper Kyd’s work on Darksiders 2 and Assassin's Creed 2 (Venice rooftops).

Different vibe but the Planet Zoo soundtrack also describes a mood and a place rather than what the player is doing:

morz434,1k6kv02,reddit,"Doom 2016

Nier Replicant and Nier Automata

Lies of P (specifically the tracks from the in-game record collection)

By all accounts the newly released Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has a phenomenal soundtrack I keep seeing people praise, though I haven’t started it myself.

Final Fantasy games, Dragon Quest, Chrono Trigger… Chock full of nostalgic, great tracks. Classic Pokemon, too (Gen 1 - 4 being my faves).

It would be remiss to not mention Persona 3 - 5. All have amazing soundtracks that vary in style.

The music from Kindgom Come Deliverance is unironically great. Even the stuff that sounds like slightly more “silly” village music just sounds so authentic. Idk if it’s truly accurate, but it’s good. The landscape sounds and music are really good too. A lovely use of French horns that kind of takes me back to Skyrim but with less of the “fantasy” feel and vibe the ebbs and swells of Skyrim’s OST give me.

Final Fantasy 14 has had some banger tracks over the years. Dragonsong playing during the credits of Heavensward, Close in the Distance slowly building upon itself and then culminating during the final moments exploring the final area of the Endwalker expansion… Absolute shivers.


Kingdom Hearts. Dearly Beloved is an all time classic. And those bops Uganda Hikaru did for the trailers? Simple and Clean and Sanctuary still go hard. Not to mention some of the battle music and music for some of the worlds and locations you go to.


Fuck, man… You know—I’m struggling to think. I really do love music and tend to notice when a game’s sounds really start to capture me and make me feel something. I do a terrible job of creating any sort of playlists to remember them by, though.",2025-04-24 12:21:56,1,ffxivfanboi,gaming

pick and unlock characters to level up, you can customize and grind gear for them, certain characters fulfill a role but you can customize which abilities you take which can lead you into more offensive/Tank/Support roles.

Out of all 4 games in the franchise, I think Diablo 3 is probably the most like Wayfinder - however, the isometric view and more single-player focus may not be your cup of tea. Grim Dawn is also capable of multiplayer, but it's very similar to Diablo, in that the dungeons aren't those 5-30 minute contained areas, and you're doing a bit more exploration and such.

I believe Dark Alliance (the DnD game from a few years back) was similar to Wayfinder (i.e. PvE in groups in multiplayer), but that game was apparently atrocious, so I don't think it will be your thing, sadly.

I hope that offers you something - admittedly, there aren't too many games exactly like Wayfinder",2025-04-13 00:26:13,1,ZXSth,gaming

It's technically more of a visual novel than a game (there are no puzzles or branching paths or anything, really the only interaction on the player's part is clicking through dialogue), but if you're looking for a good mystery game with tons of intrigue and clever plot twists and big reveals, it hits the nail right on the head. Plus, now's a great time to get into it since two of the planned three volumes are currently out, giving fans plenty of time to speculate and theorize before the final volume comes out, hopefully later this year.

The plot centers around a small monastery in the 1400's. The story is narrated by a young nun who, after spending most of her life as the monastery's anchoress (basically being sequestered to a single room that she can't leave), is suddenly thrust out and tasked with solving the murder of one of her fellow nuns. Since she was the anchoress, she's basically the one person whose innocence can be confirmed, but that also means she has to balance acclimating to a life outside of her room while also trying to ingratiate herself to a whole cadre of other nuns (and figure out if any of them is secretly a murderer).",2025-04-15 19:33:23,2,NateHohl,gaming

mn81vc7,1jzpppx,reddit,"If you are interested in Tactics-style gameplay, I recommend Triangle Strategy. Went in almost completely blind and it quickly rose to one of my favourite JRPG stories ever.

It also helps that the HD2D art is gorgeous, and while there aren't a \*ton\* of choices in the game it's definitely a gem in my opinion.

Also, PMD, as other comments have stated. I didn't play Gates of Infinity and found Super a bit lackluster, but Rescue Team and Explorers of Sky have stories that go sky-high compared to mainline Pokemon games. Specifically go with Sky if you want to try out Explorers, since it has more story content, including side stories which really enhance the experience (especially the fifth one).

mkrsbde,1jogjep,reddit,"Mass Effect 3:

For me several things should've determined a good ending.

1. Scan all keepers in the first game
2. Wrex survives encounter on Virmire
3. Kaiden survives on Virmire
4. Council saved in first game
5. Heretics destroyed in second game
6. All loyalty missions completed, all companions survive in second game
7. Collector Base destroyed
8. Wrex and Eve alive, Genophage cured
9. Samara helped
10. Geth and Quarian peace, Koris survives

Chorban's data on the keepers enables us to have some insight on the Citadel's functions, the Council being saved gives us Salarian support in the third game when we cure the Genophage, the heretics destroyed limits Reaper influence on Geth, all companions contribute something to the final battle, and the Collector Base being destroyed means we acquire the Reaper's heart in the Cerberus HQ, not its brain.

During the Reaper Destroyer part, both Jack's and Kaiden's students, plus Samara and the Asari Justicar order form a super combined biotic warp to fuck up the destroyer's armour, and momentarily disrupt the jamming, making the first Thanix missiles hit the Destroyer meaning you still have a set left.

During the final mission at a certain part, Turian and Krogan troops would act as a distraction for harbinger, and the final Thanix missiles destabilize him. if Wreav is in charge then he only sends a token force of Krogan to do the distraction with the Turians, and if you betrayed Wrex by not curing the Genophage then no Krogan are sent.

At the Catalyst you use some sort of McGuffin developed by the combined efforts of the Salarians, Quarians and Geth, made using data from Chorban's keeper scans, this McGuffin enables the Destroy ending to only target the Reapers themselves. If heretics survive then Geth are reluctant to work with organics, if Koris is dead then the Geth and Quarians don't work together on the project, and the Salarians only contribute if you saved the council in the first game.",2025-03-31 23:26:55,55,Xenozip3371Alpha,gaming

mk8rlju,1jm1dm7,reddit,"OMG SOOOOOO MANY

I fail to understand how so much simple annoyance gets through devs.

TLoZ:BotW and TotK: Cooking.  It's so unnecessarily cumbersome. Tears gives you a recipe book at least to some degree but its not enough. You have to select up to 5 items, put them in your hand, then drop them in a cook pot, and wait for a cooking animation. Then the product pops up on your screen, and you have to accept through that screen. The real kicker is that there are only a few foods really worth making, and a lot of what you get is kind of trash and wasted ingredients.

Final Fantasy Remake: Change the last boss, get rid of the ghosts. Fix your hardest difficulty to allow the use of items. You can only rest at a bench, and that's the only way to get your mana back, effectively nerfing magic, which was already weak, even further. It makes any chest you find along the way useless since they tend to have items in them that you cannot use.

I could go on for days, as there are so many times that the player is not considered when development happens. Pointless animations, difficult selection methods, all kinds of things that could be streamlined and respect a Players time. I get that there is a balance that needs to be struck between immersive play and player convenience, but I feel that you should always err on the side of player convenience.

My gripes come in with the layout of sidequests, it feels VERY much like how XIV (the MMO) does, so it is very much NPC to NPC, and not a really good way for faster movement. In addition, especially in Final Fantasy mode in NG+, the enemies are mostly damage sponges, and if you don't run Zantetsuken, it takes forever to kill the mobs.

Pokemon Scarlet: Right off, generation 9 has been my favorite story and layout of any Pokemon game. Issues come in with the graphics and performance problems, which everyone agrees with. The game could perform so much more smoothly if they spent some extra time to clean it up. I also love how we could complete the badges in any order...but unfortunately the game was only really designed with one order, and going outside that either means being way overleveled or way underleveled.

Metaphor ReFantazio: Have not beaten this game quite yet, on the last little stretch near the end.

mkbpbvd,1jm1dm7,reddit,"Dyson Sphere Program is a factory game set in space that I absolutely adore.

It has two automated logistics options: planetary logistics stations, which allow shipping between two locations on the same planet, and interplanetary logistics stations, which can do the same, but can also ship to different star systems. The player themselves can also launch towards any star at any time.

I think it's a pity that as soon as you're able to produce space warpers, location doesn't matter anymore and you can build anything on any star without any trouble, which harms the feeling of exploration.

I would have loved if, instead of space warpers and interplanetary logistics stations, the game would have had star gates. A star gate is produced in pairs and allows instantaneous travel between its two end points. You can launch one end of the gate to another star, but it will fly there using conventional propulsion. So, it will take several hours of real time for it to arrive at the other star.

Once it's there, you can either fly through the gate yourself to explore, or route shipping through it using regular planetary logistics stations.

There needs to be a mechanic that ensures you don't launch 60 star gates from the same hub system, and you're incentivised to slowly build out a more complex network. For example, the gates could suffer a 10% chance of breaking down for every light year of flight, or they could have a limited action radius, or they could be limited to five per star system (maybe they can only go in the lagrange points of the star and the biggest planet?), or the energy requirements to operate one scales with the square of distancs travelled...

Sometimes it is hard to go back to play an older entry in a series after playing the latest one, and I like good stories, so I am usually in favour of playing games in a series chronologically. 


Of course the are exceptions. Like, If a series is very, very old and the first entry is from like 1988 I might skip it. Another example would be a series where each game has more or less self contained stories. Finally, games that focus on mechanics mostly and level and narrative design is not really a thing in traditional sense (so like most strategy or sport games), then it does not really matter all that much.",2025-04-22 15:22:02,1,Icy_Moose4322,gaming

mobf8z9,1k4noln,reddit,"I do like doing this, but I do it purely for my own curiosity and not for any sense of obligation. I do it at my discretion, depending on the game and on my mood.

For example, I knew I wanted to play Ys VIII Lacrimosa of Dana, but I was _also_ interested in finally playing the original Ys Book I & II, which was always a bit of a mystery to younger me. So I decided to play Book I & II, and I ended up liking it so much I decided to play Ys III, Ys IV, the other Ys IV, Ys V, Ys VI, Ys Seven,  Ys Origin, Ys Oath in Felghana, Ys Memories of Celceta,.... and THEN I finally got around to actually playing Ys VIII, which was the original goal. 

And Ys 8 is my favourite in the series now, haha. ...And yes, I already knew that playing the entire backlog was absolutely not necessary at all, but I did enjoy my journey regardless because they're relatively short and fast-paced games. At least the older ones anyway.



However, on the other hand, I decidedly did not do this for Final Fantasy. The first Final Fantasy I played was FF7 way back in 2015, but I only got up to disc 2 before losing momentum and stopped for whatever reason. The first FF I ever beat was Crystal Chronicles. Then I played most of FF10, but never managed to beat the final boss. Then I played FF8 all the way through and loved it, then went on to FF4, then FF4 The After Years, FF5, FF6, and then finally FF9. And that's where my journey through the series has stopped for the moment. ....I still never finished FF7. Maybe I'll get back to it at some point.

So yeah. Some series feel fun to play in order, others I kinda just jump around as I feel like it. Depends on my mood. It's fun to do a release-order marathon, but I in no way feel obligated to do so",2025-04-21 20:35:24,1,BenjyMLewis,gaming

If he's into shooters the og doom even if I personally feel it's horrible on console it's still a fantastic game and very basic in its original form.

If he enjoys doom and wants more you could look into heretic, Hexen or even Descent for a more 3 dimensional space aged shooter. 

There's also forza, forza horizons, gran turismo, need for speed, nfs underground 2 (personal favourite) if he's into cars.

Don't forget you can get emulators that just plug into a hdmi port on the TV that come with 2 controllers and run games like galaga, asteroids, space invaders etc and they're cheap. They're heaps of fun if your into really old games.

Or good old fashioned chess, checkers, mahjong. Maybe even the sims? Not sure if the sims is on console however but it will run on a dirt cheap laptop from marketplace.

But that doesn't address how they removed 2CP for what I felt like was a less fun gamemode, and made it 5v5, turning my favorite role as off-tank into non-existence and making characters I loved to play like Hammond feel like dogwater because his kit was never meant to be the solo tank carrying your team no matter how much armor/HP buffs you add.

You get better features with that out of major console maker ones though since Steam can actively let you do extra things with the numerous doodads Xbox doesn't have.

Man of medan I really enjoyed the mystery and plot. 


Little hope I enjoyed a lot but didn't particularly like the ending. 


The Devil in me is the one I was most excited for and wanted to like but was really let down. I was expecting more SAW with scary serial killer vibes. But it ended up feeling very schlocky, weird, over the top in a bad way, and made me roll my eyes.

Man of Medan was my favorite. I liked its trapped-on-a-rusting-ghost-ship setting best and I mostly wanted to keep its people alive. Little Hope had a lot of wandering around dark woods at night which is a setting I don't enjoy much in horror movies, but I liked it fine.

mky2y5i,1jpam5i,reddit,"RDR is definitely still a good game and the story is worth playing, but also remember it came out first and it’ll be pretty obvious they didn’t really have a plan for a prequel. Most characters aren’t mentioned at all, Arthur most notably. To me, RDR2’s story hits a lot harder knowing what I know from RDR. There’s a tension and ominous tone throughout due to the fact that if you played the first one, you already knew how RDR2 was going to end. You already knew that Arthur wasn’t going to make it and many of the others, so it adds the tension of “what happens to all these characters I now love?”

It’s kind of like Star Wars. Sure you could watch them in episodic order, but it’s pretty obvious 1-3 weren’t fully fleshed out ideas when Episode 4 got made (hell even 5 and 6 clearly weren’t fully thought out) and so the story suffers a bit that way. It’s the same here with RDR. 1 takes place after 2, but there’s a lot of stuff that happens in 2 that is never even talked about or mentioned in the first. What happened to John prior to the start of the game is left pretty vague throughout RDR and tons of detail is left out. 

This isn’t to dissuade you from playing it; you should definitely play it. But I think it’s more rewarding to play 2 after 1, and not the other way around.",2025-04-02 00:19:18,8,DejounteMurrayisGOAT,gaming

mkzsplr,1jpam5i,reddit,"RDR 1 generally holds up quite well. It's less of a ""cowboy movie simulator"" like RDR 2, and more of an actual video game. (Not to hate on RDR 2, it's great.)

All the negatives are mostly age-related. The game has excellent graphics, physics, voice-acting, and music, but obviously it's like 14 or 15 years old, so it is contemporary to that time. Still, it easily is superior to most games then, and is superior to many modern games even.

It is a pretty simple game, but in a satisfying way. Its strength is in its simplicity. I feel like RDR 2 did not really understand this. 2 is basically just a stretched out and overly complex version of 1. It's almost like a remake. 

So 2 is more immersive and deep, but 1 does what it does so well, that it doesn't need any window dressing. 2 is still very good though.",2025-04-02 08:41:27,2,ChillGreenDragon,gaming

I play rdr2 first, rdr1 second and i didn't see anything of  significant that I miss. There were some very brief nod to rdr1 in rdr2 and that's pretty much it.

RDR1 came -after- the events of RDR2 chronologically.

John Marston basically spends the entire game cleaning up the mess left by Dutch and the rest of the gang after Arthur's death.

If you're in it for the storyline, and have never played RDR1, I'd say absolutely go for it. It's a TakeTwo/Rockstar game... you're NEVER going to be disappointed in a Rockstar storyline. The Houser brothers have -always- been top notch when it comes to delivering a polished product.

RDR1's story is worth the playthrough alone, even if you don't bother with all the side shit.

First the graphics were left as they were in 2010 and are somehow worse than GTA 4 in 2008. The movement is very robotic and the control is not really good. Horseback riding is bad compared to even GUN from 2005 let alone RDR 2. Accuracy is really weird, shooting people feels unimpactfull and unsatisfying. People keep walking after 3 bullets from revolver to the chest. Animations are also bad especially if you played RDR 2 beforhand.

The great cast of characters, the absolutely gorgeous world filled with fun side quests/stories, and variety in how you can build your Misthios, variety in the combat, the ship battles are the best they’ve ever been, boarding was always epic. Kassandra is also the best main protagonist they’ve made. She has a great sense of humor, she’s tough when she needs to be but still allows herself to be vulnerable.

They could honestly have cut the number of assassination targets in half and just put that time and effort into making them all as cinematic as the main assassination targets, but they've set this bar of having all this stuff that they won't go back.

There’s nothing even educational about them either, it’s literally just empty stats to fill the knowledge meter but you’re not actually learning anything knowledgeable!

One thing I do like about most of the other quests is how they’re almost all tied into assassination — you’re basically always trying to find info on a target, or you’re going to kill a target. There are so many different factions you gotta take out and I love how most of the game is just like detective work to find and take them out. I stumbled upon the head of an evil family and when I took him out, a bunch of his sons suddenly appeared looking for revenge and so I had to stealthily take them out too.

Played Mirage last year and it was the most fun I had in recent years , it was clear MIRAGE was a love letter to fans and a return to the roots for the old AC formula with stealth and assassinations and no bloat with very little side content.

Valhalla was a blast and I have over 110 hours in it , the rune system and armor sets blow out Ac Shadows out of the water , also the world/region is way more beautiful , it's a shame I wasted money on it , this game is even worse then Ghost of Tsushima , atleast Tsushi had great snappy combat with parries and chain kills boosted by another great rune system.

AC Shadows is just a snooze fest and i'm not even gonna go into the DEI and woke aspects everyone is crying about just speaking objectively about why the game is bad and shallow and super repetitive compared to the previous games. Engravings are boring and OP , no bonus sets , the 3 abilities with upgrades you have get super repetitive and telegraphed, this formula is super dated.

mn3c5ps,1jyw4gd,reddit,"Think you need something arcadey, even though it's outside your favorites' scope. Something that relies more on snap decision making instead of planning like RPGs (which can be hard when your brain is in sluggish 'i-don't-want-to-do-anything' depresso mode), and doesn't have a huge time commitment like a game like Persona does. Some recommendations in that vein:

[Doom's 2016 reboot](https://store.steampowered.com/app/379720/DOOM/) is a great adrenaline-inducing linear experience. The music, split-second action, well-paced introduction of new weapons, and lightweight exploration are good for getting your brain out of sleep mode.

[Severed Steel](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1227690/Severed_Steel/) is another ""movement shooter"" that puts focus on bullet time and movement tricks (wallrunning, sliding, somersaulting) that gets you into a constant state of ""in the moment."" It's a super short game, the campaign is only like 2 hours long, but the pseudoparkour and slo-mo makes you feel stylish as hell for every single minute. You should try the demo.

[Princess Remedy in a World of Hurt](https://store.steampowered.com/app/407900/Princess_Remedy_in_a_World_of_Hurt/) is a free bullet hell game. Super quirky and dumb, and pretty short (~2 hours). Don't feel bad about playing on the lowest difficulty if you don't normally do bullet hell games, because the final boss sucks.

[Post Void](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285670/Post_Void/) is most raw ""gameplay"" I can think of. Super short (~6 min playthroughs), super simple, and all psychosis. It's basically a junkfood game: quick, cheap, bad for your health. If the screenshots alone don't make you nauseous, it's much cheaper and purportedly safer than injecting caffeine into your eyeballs. May be pretty difficult if you don't have much twitch shooter reflex built up. There's also a somewhat recent game [Mullet Madjack](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2111190/MULLET_MADJACK/) that looks like a much more fleshed out Post Void from what I've seen, but I haven't played it beyond a bit of the demo.",2025-04-14 17:17:25,1,Vagrant_Savant,gaming

I'm a freelance game dev and have been devving for like 8 years total, for the last 4 years it's been my full time job making games for other people.

I've been really wanting to make my own game, but one thing I realized the most is that most games I work on have such a limited perspective, that they seem to really miss on some key things that would make the game a lot more fun.

I'm considering trying to make some kind of following where I can take my game concepts and iron them out with the gaming community, and trying to get a community together to make games that are shaped by the community, at least after the major parts of the game are ironed out by myself.

Failure – A Medieval Fantasy Game Centered on Imperfection

Failure is a dark fantasy game where players explore a world shaped by corruption, forgotten gods, and the remnants of fallen civilizations. The game focuses on reputation, faction conflicts, and dynamic world events that change based on player actions. Magic is rare and dangerous, affecting the user's sanity, while combat emphasizes close-quarters melee with unique weapon effects.

Enemies, called Failures, are cursed remnants of adventurers with unique fighting styles. Some specialize in heavy melee, some manipulate reality with magic, others strike from the shadows with poison, and some mix multiple combat techniques. Powerful bosses roam the world, including Severance, the Heart-Hunter, a relentless six-armed monster that speeds up as its heart is damaged, and Dirge of Flesh, the Corpse God, a massive entity of fused corpses that regenerates unless burned.

Magic & Sanity

Magic is divided into two types. Mages, the only magic-using players, study to learn spells, gaining control at the cost of raw power. Sorcerers and witches, rare NPCs born with magic, wield stronger but unstable abilities. Rituals, relics, and cult affiliations can temporarily enhance spells. Sanity replaces mana as a resource, and losing too much causes Fractured Mind, a condition with escalating insanity effects.

Players who completely lose their sanity are hunted by Severance, and defeat sends them to Tharok’s Fog, a cursed zone that can only be escaped using Whispering Tokens or outside player assistance, which comes at the cost of gaining insanity.

The Three Realms

The Peaks

A sky-bound wasteland of ruins and forgotten elites. The False Memory system allows players to interact with the echoes of demi-gods, who offer quests to spread their lingering influence. The Library of Forgotten Echoes holds ancient knowledge, guarded by the enigmatic Archivist. A massive Barrier surrounds the Peaks, and beyond it lies an endless mirror-like ground. The further one travels, the more their reflection distorts, leading to insanity due to the overwhelming presence of the True Gods' traces—beings larger than mountains and beyond comprehension.

The Overworld

The surface realm is divided into seven kingdoms, each with unique cultures, struggles, and dangers.

Varsilia – The starting kingdom. Peaceful on the surface, but rotten with corruption.

Eralen – A frozen land of mercenaries where strength dictates rule.

Kael’Thorn – A jungle fortress of alchemy, poisons, and secret cults.

Draumir – A volcanic stronghold of master blacksmiths and brutal politics.

Syrentha – A mysterious and isolated kingdom. Few return from its depths.

Tharok – A fog-covered city with rare magic-tech, but few survive reaching it.

Velkaine – A noble city of wealth and corruption, home to Friguld, a powerful faction.


The Overworld once had eleven kingdoms, but four have fallen:

One fell to madness.

Three were consumed by the Horrors.


The world is surrounded by a vast ocean that can be explored, but prolonged presence attracts the Horrors, eldritch entities that do not belong to this world.

The Depths & The Abyss

A labyrinth of forgotten civilizations, cursed ruins, and ancient horrors. The Abyss is an endless void of absolute darkness, where Failures wander aimlessly, twisted by curses. At its deepest point lies the true edge of existence, where even knowledge itself can be erased. Some quests task players with destroying forbidden records hidden within the Abyss to prevent their discovery.

The Lore of Failure

The world was once ruled by the True Gods, beings of incomprehensible power who have long disappeared. Their lingering presence still warps reality. In their absence, Failed Gods—beings that attempted ascension but failed—have become echoes, mindless husks, or false deities demanding worship.

Stultus, the Great Sorcerer of Egor

Once a brilliant mage, Stultus used space magic to halt his aging. His greatest mistake was tearing open a rift, unleashing the Horrors that consumed three kingdoms. Though he sealed the breach, he now manipulates the world from the shadows, working to prevent another invasion. He leads a secret cult, deceiving its followers into worshiping the Horrors to control dangerous knowledge and stop reckless summoning.

Players who encounter Stultus must make a choice:

Stay Silent → Receive the Ancient Monocle, which reduces sanity loss and increases critical hit rate.

Defy Him → Get executed and gain Fractured Mind, but he knows the player survived.


If defied, Stultus will reappear in disguise, sometimes offering hush money, other times attempting another execution.

A World of Imperfection

Failure is a game about exploring a broken world, surviving in its ruins, and uncovering the tragic past left behind. Every decision carries weight, and no path is perfect.

I'm a small newish twitch streamer and newtuber doing horror gaming on twitch weekdays Monday-Friday for the past 2 months or so, and YouTube I've been doing for just over a month posting Tuesdays & Fridays. Before I started streaming and posting videos I used to watch a lot of Pokemon challenge runs but for the past year or two got really into watching horror playthroughs, not really sure why but I just liked the strange atmosphere of the games and they just seemed fun to play/experience. Since I didn't think \*playing\* horror games was for me at first (big difference between watching and playing since I could hide the really spooky jumpscares while watching), I decided originally to stream Pokemon (hence my name) but while I have nostalgia for the games, I haven't played the more recent ones and I'm not very good at challenge runs like I personally was watching. So didn't end up liking it. Transitioned to RPG's for a bit, then gave up with that and just started doing horror games anyway and I've been having a lot more fun!

mkqwp4c,1jocrk8,reddit,"Finally, someone mentioned it! I loved this game most out of the franchise (I didn't play S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2). 

This ending is the most common one for everyone who plays the game for the first time. It symbolizes the character's greed, which kills him, because under the curse he sees gold coins falling and killing him.  
  
We can see that in each ending, whenever a wish is fulfilled, it is fulfilled in an absurd or exaggerated way. In no case does the protagonist's desire to get something lead him to anything positive. 

  
In my personal opinion, the wish-granter punishes the character for wanting to use him for personal purposes. Or it doesn't want humans to try to change the world. Maybe people are just users, not those who can change something global or they're the ones that are supposed to build it without any help. So human is supposed to give, but not to receive. We can discuss this for a long time.

something a bit more active but low clicks are auto battlers like teamfight tactics in league, aka the auto chess genre, where you buy and place units who fights automatically, and is very much designed with short rounds and keyboard shortcuts in mind

the entire JRPG genre is kinda defined as 100+ hour games with turnbased combat with like 80+ hours being dialogue which can be nice if one is willing to get into it.

Otherwise the Roguelike genre has a ton of turnbased games that might work like slay the spire or across the obelisk where alot of luck, skill and planning collides but its not intensive.

In theory the ARPG diablo like space also has various builds which might be useful like last epoch just started a new season and you can play a spin to win sentinel where all you need to do is just move around while you kill everything around you

I recommend JRPG’s that follows this approach. The first like, 10 Final Fantasy titles and the Persona series are great. Also Dragon Quest. My personal recommendation goes to Persona 3 Reload. Genuinely amazing story with fantastic characters and it’s definitely a time sink. For pretty much every Persona game, they can run pretty long, up to 100 hours at most for casual play throughs. Some people take even longer than that but that’s because they decided to do something unorthodox that caused a dramatic increase in game time.

moslcoc,1k6sqf0,reddit,"It’s mind blowing how little you guys understand what low button input means. The guy isn’t asking for the lowest apm games on the market, there’s a huge difference between playing Fortnite cranking 90s and a turn based 1 input per minute game. 

To genuinely answer your question, as long as you have relatively stable hands and don’t have severe injury, MMOs can be good, a lot less inputs than say an fps or moba. Still high apm at some points and depending on the content, not even close to Fortnite or call of duty. 

Story based rpgs are amazing. Things like the witcher, red dead redemption, gta, etc. 

Grindy games like monster hunter are very fun and rewarding as well. Any rouguelite/roguelike. Super addicting and very very fun with a bit of grind to keep you progressing and feeling good.

As others have mentioned some turn based games are great, persona comes to mind first, but you really have to care about story above all with most games in this genre. The combat is more of an after thought in some turn based games so really make sure you are excited to learn the story.

Other grindyish games include, Tarkov, which is yes an fps, but it’s a slow tactical one that doesn’t require constant jump peaking / building sky scrapers lol. It’s more methodical and slow, if you’re looking for something PvP oriented you can try something like a competitive card game like hearthstone, magic, or marvel snap. And mmo recommendations going from least apm to most would be old school RuneScape, final fantasy 14 (no you don’t have to play any of the others AT ALL but they are great games, absolutely no connection to this game though), and wow.

After beating it, I had Hollow Knight in my Top 10 games, and CRAVED another experience like it. My buddy at work talked me into playing Dark Souls a few years later, and it had a lot of what I was looking for from my Hollow Knight experience. It has a mysterious ambience to it, leaves you as the player to figure out direction and next steps, tells a lot of story through environment and item lore, and has a difficulty that I would consider 'hard but fair'. All of these things were aspects that I had really enjoyed in Hollow Knight and didn't know I was looking for until I experienced it again.

mokjvov,1k5srsj,reddit,"Zone scaling can work, like say you have a zone that scales from a minimum to a maximum when you enter. For example it scales from ""level 1-5"" depending on when you enter and then remembers that level so that it is now fixed. Then another more dangerous zone scales from ""6-10"" etc. This means the game allows you to overpower your character before you enter a zone or to leave a zone and overpower your character and return to it.

That was the model Fallout New Vegas used, and I'd say it worked pretty well. It didn't feel like the game world mechanically scaled to your character, since you could outgrow zones and return to encounters with a more powerful character.

Fixed scaling where everything just follows you generally sucks for a lot of RPGs, as it makes progression useless. Perhaps one of the best / worst examples was the original ES: Oblivion game where you if you took your character to max level, almost any random lowly mob could oneshot you... but comparably, if you stayed at the lowest levels, you could breeze through all content with no difficulty at all.

That said, fixed scaling is a staple for ARPGs like Diablo, Path of Exile etc, so it does have its place.

Scaling done poorly is fighting a lvl 1 goblin peon at level 1 and having a struggle then coming back to the same cave at lvl 60 and fighting a lvl 60 goblin peon and having the same struggle. Or worse yet, because you didn’t level optimally to lvl 60 or you dont have good lvl 60 gear now the lvl 60 goblin peon is harder. (Cough og oblivion)


Scaling done well is fighting a lvl 1 goblin peon at lvl 1 and having a struggle then coming back to the same cave at lvl 60 and fighting a lvl 60 Balrog of Morgoth and having a struggle. Meanwhile the goblin peons are still lvl 1 and die instantly.

moth811,1k5srsj,reddit,"It really depends on the game.

Level scaling isn't bad per se, it works in games that are naturally open-ended where they want the player to have freedom to go where they want and do content in the order they want.  Level scaling allows players to progress while the game still can still offer some sort of challenge, since having the entire world be at your starting player would simply let you 1-shot everything after you level up a bit.

The issue with trying to implement scaling however is that the two systems can be at odds.  Leveling should make you feel stronger.  But this can come at odds with good difficulty design which naturally wants the game to start easier, and get more challenging as the player starts to figure out the game.  So the question then becomes how you make the player feel more powerful, despite the world technically growing stronger over time to give them a good challenge.

So how do you make it work?  Ultimately the answer in my opinion comes in presentation.  The most effective way in my opinion is to simply spawn stronger enemies rather than just boosting stats.  Leveling up and visiting a cave of goblins that are now suddenly stronger doesn't feel great.  Leveling up and visiting a cave that now has orcs mixed in with the goblins feels great because you are now fighting things you haven't been able to fight or kill before.  And having the lower level enemies still show up occasionally to give you that satisfaction of being able to obliterated enemies you used to struggle with can also help a lot.  Functionally it's the same thing with the world simply leveling up as you do, and growing stronger overall, but it still feels like you are growing more powerful since you are taking on new enemies.",2025-04-24 16:56:58,1,Kamakaziturtle,gaming

A lot of RPGs have tons of optional content and if it's open world and undefined order for doing content. 


This creates a problem, you don't know how powerful a player is going to be when they hit content. 


If there is no level scaling players who focus on the main quest will be underleved and explorers/completionist will be over leveled and a reverse difficulty curve (that the camp I am usually in and I hate being over leveled as it makes everything boring). 



My preference is level ranges. Aka this area can be between level 10-20 to add flexibility.  Some games that do this lock the area to a level after you enter it so you can leave and come back later and feel the difference from the extra levels. 


Or to deemphasize state increases so there isn't a huge difference in power level (leveling is more about skills and builds) but a lot people don't like that either and want bigger numbers. ",2025-04-23 09:37:08,1,Briar_Knight,gaming

- The dialogue is...unique.The protagonist is an ass for no reason. In the same sentence of, say, asking for help he'll throw in some hostile bullshit. It is _very_ jarring.


- The open world (fuck technicalities) is goddamn _infuriating._ Enemies are everywhere and endless and so are cameras. The game pretty much pushes you from one objective to another as fighting is a waste of time and ammo.",2025-04-10 10:33:54,3,MadmanMarkMiller,gaming

If you do your homework, you will definitely get backers. Come up with a good car modification system that can translate to plastic minis, flesh out the world and I think you'd have a winner on your hands.

So, is it risky to purchase games from Turkish region with a foreign international visa card? I've already tried and it was successful.

moqoco1,1k2ccfx,reddit,"I've only played Forever Skies and Lost Skies. Between the two I really like Lost Skies... If only it were more polished. Traversing with the generously ranged grappling hook that makes Spiderman seem like a SpiderBABY is awesome. The building is simple and slightly limited but still reasonable. The story is being slowly built upon and you can tell but these kinds of games aren't for people who need plot or path. 
Forever skies was smooth, but I lost interest after finishing the story. It's definitely a one time experience. I think introducing a purpose instead of giving just a setting limits the endgame play.

moqpgbz,1k2ccfx,reddit,"I've been really enjoying Forever Skies and really *not* enjoying Lost Skies. I like that Forever Skies is so crafting-heavy. You spend a lot of early game feeling like you're going through a bunch of menus, but once you upgrade your gear it feels less ""menu-simulator"" and more dynamic. I love the seamlessness of sailing and expanding and decorating your mobile basw, and the scenery is jawdropping. There aren't a lot of hostiles to worry about being environmental hazards, which is more my interest in a creative game like this.

Lost Skies I've been less impressed with. I'm really struggling with the grappling hook controls and often feel punished for exploring in early game. I find it hard to navigate and you can't craft ammunition on your person, which sucks when you're happily exploring the gorgeous scenery and suddenly shotgun turrets blast you off the entire map when you realize you're out of ammo. There are weird duplication  glitches that go hand in hand with early access. I'm hoping balancing patches will update it but I confess I've spent most of my time being salty and wishing I were playing Forever Skies instead. I promised my boyf I'd give it a chance since he gave FS a chance for me, and I admit the shipbuilding controls are neat,  but I think FS is more intuitive anyway.",2025-04-24 05:28:59,1,empressofspite,gaming

You can easily sink hundreds of hours into one base and make it work using completely different approaches to design. Plus a bit of tower defense as you have to defend your factory, but the approach is not to make absolute defences but to make defences you can build a lot which can be on their own for as much as possible.

Its like Minecraft, but with an actual story campaign, and while you can play after completing it, the only downside (imo) was there's no ""open world"" survival like Minecraft. You get the main story island, the three little story islands, and some secret islands later. Still 100% worth it. If you get it on Xbox, it comes with the dlc!

Factorio also comes to mind, another construction-edque game, about making a factory though (to put it very simply) also loads of fun! Ive been making huge mines to harvest entire ore fields at once and using trains to move the resources in bulk! 

Tactics games are another idea, turn based isometric (sort of 2d / top down). Final fantasy tactics (various versions) or ogre tactics make good examples. Another one made by an indie that I'm absolutely in love with is ""Our Adventurer Guild"". Very much a tactic game, but you take over and manage your (in game) friends guild, as his last dying wish, he wants you to restore the guild to its former glory.

mntw13c,1k202v5,reddit,"As someone who, way back in the day, used to game on consoles (Gamecube and PS2) in the back of a truck cab where space was a premium there's some advice I can give you.

Get a bean bag or large floor cushion(s). If your bed is in a corner or up against a wall you can use the bean bag/cushion(s), along with any pillows, as back support effectively turning your bed into a giant chair.  So long as the bed isn't one of those divan style beds you can store the bag/cushion under the bed when not needed.

Set yourself a strict sleeping regime were you stop gaming at least two hours before you have to sleep so your brain isn't being over stimulated.  Watch a movie or read a book instead late in the evening.  And most importantly of all, turn off the power or pull the plug to your TV/consoles because only takes one blinking standby light to completely mess up your Circadian rhythm and give you a bad nights sleep.",2025-04-18 21:44:53,1,Rhioganedd,gaming

Do something to set yourself a timer or hard stop on the console/TV at night when you need to sleep. Maybe a smart plug that shuts off at X time every night, worst case. 

The worst thing that you can do is spiral down and just play games or watch TV late when you should sleep. You don't have the separation you'd usually have and hardships can make you slip and form bad habits. That's what past experience tells me. Some people do ok with a TV in the bedroom, I'm not one of them and it's best to err on the side of caution imo. 

In terms of comfort, a hard pillow to prop yourself sitting up, a wall mount, and honestly maybe a pair of headphones instead of a sound system would be the way to go.",2025-04-18 09:01:42,1,HeliumIsotope,gaming

I will say though, despite the flak it gets from a lot of people, World of Warcraft is like nothing id ever experienced on console. You gotta at least try it.",2025-04-08 02:23:04,10,ImpressFederal4169,gaming
mlz6uuk,1ju2pg4,reddit,"So what you're probably going to find is a lot of great games on pc are also popular on the other consoles but playing them on pc just adds to their alure. Games like Baldur's Gate 3, Skyrim & Fallout, Cyberpunk 2077, GTA, Elden Ring, etc. PC adds to the greatness of them through mods, graphics, etc.

Games that are PC exclusive/meant for pc gets to some real gems though, glad you're looking at those too! Some of my favorites are Noita, Dyson Sphere Program/Satisfactory/Factorio (these may SEEM like boring tedious games but give them a shot for a few hours and get back to me lol), Kenshi, Cities: Skylines (preferably the first with all dlc + mods that seem cool), No Man's Sky, Civ, and Kerbal Space Program.

Also a couple fuckin bangers that are some all time greats? Outer Wilds (just drop in, don't look it up, don't ask questions) and Disco: Elysium",2025-04-08 03:25:16,8,debirdiev,gaming

mm0e6zc,1ju2pg4,reddit,"Hell, I can pretty much suggest entire genres.

RTS is a genre very under represented on console. So you can either go for the classics like AOE2 or Dawn of War or pick something newer.

Turn based games like the Total War games are great. That has both turn based and RTS elements. Civilisation is turn based exclusively, and has many similar games like Endless legend and Warhammer's Gladius.

You also have the more spreadsheet sim variants like EUIV or HOI4. These are not for the faint of heart but especially with EUIV and Stellaris the depth of options and play available is insane.

When it comes to shooters, there's different levels on top of what's already there - Counter Strike is more tactical and skill based, ARMA is way more Mil sim etc.

And on simulators - there's a shit load of those as well. Not just Flight sim or Forklift simulator or w/e - Rimworld and Cities Skylines for instance for base building simulation or cities simulation. Factorio for the factory building madness. Now with mods.

Which brings me on to another thing - are there any games you can think of you loved on console but needed just that bit more? Now you have access to modding, if the game supports it - can always try that.

So I think what I'd do if I were you is look at what PC's can do that consoles can't. For instance I can still play the original Fallout games, which are great, but very retro. VTM Bloodlines is still great.

I'd look in to genres that simply don't exist on console. I'd maybe look for games I couldn't play on console due to generations I had, and play them etc. There's a lot of greater old games, and GOG has most of the good ones.

And if you feel overwhelmed, you can't go too wrong with just opening steam, and sorting by user reviews. Anything with 90%+ is probably there for a reason.",2025-04-08 10:17:03,1,timmystwin,gaming

Even things that aren't series still feel kinda samey when compared to other stuff. I've played WoW and FF14 so all other MMOs just feel like more of the same. I've played 100s of shooters and they all start to feel the same.

When I was about 6, I had a Chinese 'knock off' console with a bunch of pre loaded Atari/Nintendo games on it, got a PS1 when i turned 9, a PS2 in 2004 that lasted until 2013ish, and I briefly had a Nintendo Wii around 2012-2015.

It wasn't until COVID lockdowns that I bought a PS4, and have spent the last 5 years playing games I missed out on the PS3 era, as well as PS4 games that piqued my interest.

But I do feel like burnout is more common now, because there are only really a few types of games. Sports, open world, platformers, survival, puzzles, and run & gun. Everything else just feels like a combination of those 6 genres. Plus everything is heavily story based and focussed on these grandiose maps with unlimited possibilities that they just become daunting or tedious. You have to try and find some of those hidden gems of indie games, to really enjoy gaming again, to sort of reset. Games where you can just sort of play without thinking too hard.

I'd recommend these solo games: Deadlight, my friend Pedro, basically any 'telltale' game, I am bread, Goat simulator, Superliminal, Stanley parable, and Untitled goose game.

And these co-op games: party golf, golf with your friends, the escapist, and dismantle.

It's a heavily story based, has a few puzzles, but the entire game has no dialogue, and is amazingly captivating, because you play as a cat in a city of robots. 'Stray'. Go in blind if you can, because the less you know the better it is.",2025-04-03 14:13:53,1,Gseph,gaming

I can remember what I was doing in my life and where I was working when GTA4 came out, when I bought an Xbox, a GameCube...

My bond with my brother still revolves around video games and anytime we get together we usually play some Halo.

FFVII remake will forever be a COVID game for me because I played it non stop when work from home started.

I just have much less desire these days to keep up with the latest thing.

I bought Mario Party Jamboree to play with my girlfriend right around launch date.

Same with Mario Wonder.

Aside from those two... I don't think I own any other games that came out in the last 4 years or so.

Most of my gaming in the past year or so has been replaying games that I know I love. FFVII, VIII, X and XIII, Assassin's Creed 1 and 2, God of War (2018) Horizon: Zero Dawn.

If I was to pick up a PS5 today, there's like maybe 5 games I would want to get that I can't currently play on either Switch, PS4 or my Laptop. 

If I get a switch 2, it will be for the mario games that my girlfriend enjoys, we have a lot of fun playing them together, but it's going to cost $700 CAD for the Mario Kart bundle and potentially over $100 per game.

When I was a kid, my friend was in RuneScape clan.  One day he let me know that his internet would be down for 2 weeks, and asked if I could let the clan leaders know.  I said sure I will.

The idea struck me to instead inform them of his death.  I got on their IRC chat channel and told them he’d been hit by a bus.

To my surprise, the clan members didn’t seem all that shocked by the news. They let me know that his marriage had recently broken down after he’d lost his job, and that he’d had to move from “the big house” to a smaller one.  The only problem with this response was that my friend had never had a job nor a girlfriend, and still lived with his mother. 

My friend had been in this clan for years. He was close with these people, and he’d been lying to them about his life the whole time. I even started to wonder if he was strategically setting himself to appear offline at hours when he should be at work.  It was a very uncomfortable feeling to have uncovered that my friend was capable of this kind of thing—funny coming from someone like me, I know.

I ended up presiding over my friend’s RuneScape funeral, where we all listened to several of my favorite songs, including the full version of Bat Out of Hell.  I also arranged for his clan mates to donate items to me, which would be dropped over his RuneScape grave site.  Naturally, I kept them for myself.

Around a week later I logged into the IRC channel again to add more lore, but to my surprise I was kicked by my friend, whose internet had been restored earlier than anticipated. The last thing he ever said to me was, “Why you telling people I’m dead?”  I couldn’t bring myself to ask him why he’d been lying to his supposed friends for years.",2025-04-10 23:25:21,45,streetpatrolMC,gaming

A few years ago a clan officer openly insulted and waged an internal war on another officer because both of them were competing for a romantic relationship with a new member

mmir2pk,1jw0g9j,reddit,"I was part of the drama.
Back to around 2010, player in a WoW casual guild, i'm around 20. Me and my best friend are playing to WoW but i'm more consistent than him. He likes to switch games, gameplay, party. In short, he tend to do breaks.

The first big one was when he tried City of Heroes, maybe three months without playing WoW, without telling any guildmates, and letting a hole in the raid roster. The Guildmaster didn't like it.

Second break was when he suddenly felt the need to try playing full PvP with our other best friend, switching servers and not telling guildmates. It was the droplet that made the vase overflow, he was dead to them.

So when some months later, he wanted to come back again, and it was impossible, he just changed his in game name, applyed, and never talked again on Teamspeak. It was 2010, we didn't had friend request by account, real names or anything, he was perfectly able to merge in. 
The lie had been going on for one year. We did an IRL with some members unaware of his situations, and when they said ""We'll upload the pictures on the Forum"", we knew it was over.

So one day, before the pic release, he connected to the game, just before the raid, started speaking and go just like ""By the way, did you remember X ? Well it's me"" One second later we could read :
 ""Player has been revoked from the guild""
 ""GM: Everyone on teamspeak 10 minutes earlier the start of the raid, we have to talk"".

Two funny points before going on, at this point, i was just recently dating one guildmate. Everyone was knowing it, we were two known regulars and estimated guild members so we had the approval (if i can use this term) of everyone, and the other point, we recently had a sudden leave from a guild member, our GM was like ""We should consider drama with secrecy, it's not something to expose to anyone"" days before.

Well, we go to Teamspeak before the raid, the GM start by saying ""I've kicked X, you all know why. Now, Y (me), you knew it was him all along, why didn't you told us ?"" And for 30 minutes straight it was a fucking mess of ranting and judging me as guilty for not telling them. He didn't want to understand it was only natural for me to protect my 20 years friendship (We're still best friends to this day) over some internet people, even if i was loving them. He exposed me, ranted about me, and ofc, the guild started to break in half, with people not caring at all, and people protecting me and complaining about this rant. I was portrayed by other as a nice guy, protecting his friend, my girlfriend and their friends started protecting me.

It was mess.

One week later i was quitting the Guild with a very polite message on the Forum, and almost 20 people left with me. The people i met during the IRL, my girlfriend (my wife, actually, now) and i started a new guild, some people even didn't join us but were too disconforted by the way the GM talked to me back then.

14 years later, i'm still friends with some of these guild members, i've made some one night shot raid for fun over the years with them, my wife and i even met one of the Officer IRL who was one of her good friends. But the GM NEVER ONCE IN HIS LIFE SPOKE TO US ANYMORE. A fucking 50 years old man engulfed in his anger.",2025-04-11 06:09:49,7,Bubonikz,gaming
mmjmtvw,1jw0g9j,reddit,"This is such a dumb story but like, 7 years ago I was in a discord server with like, 200 channels.  It was a pokemon go server and they created an individual channel for a rare pokemon that a bot would find, then another channel for a rare pokemon that you could post about if the bot didn't find it, as well as several other channels that were like ""politics, pics, food, mountain dew, etc"" because there was no real channel management and the admins made new channels all the time for dumb reasons 

The bots weren't discord bots, they were different created by one of the admins specifically to find Pokemon in Pokemon go.

Anyways the bot thing took them a lot of work to set up apparently and one night one of the admins (let's call him Beans because he actually looked like beans from Even Stevens) got drunk and was in an argument with the admin who made the bots and beans ended up deleting all of them and all the bot channels in the discord.

The guy who made them was pissed because he'd have to set everything up again and he started arguing with beans and beans was like ""come on bro, you wanna fight?  Let's go"" and the other admin was fed up with his bullshit by this point so he's like alright fine, let's go.  Where we doing this?  And beans was like ""cheesecake factory.""

I'm out with a couple pokemon go friends having some beers and laughing our asses off at all of this when they said this and I'm like guys, we're right by the cheesecake factory, let's get there.  So we call an Uber and hightail it down to the cheesecake factory and soon after we get there the chill admin pulls up!  He rolls down the window and says he knows beans wasn't gonna show up but he wanted to be here to shut him up and prove he's a bitch-ass cause he knew if he didn't show up, beans was gonna claim he was there and that the chill admin pussied out.

So he mocked beans on discord from the cheesecake factory then banned him from the discord.

[I still have a pic from that night](https://imgur.com/a/qgzFHRK)

mmhjwta,1jw0g9j,reddit,"There was a Chinese game called Forsaken World. I was an officer of a guild with a GL with a history of sucking up to any guild or individual who could give her any sort of benefit. Our guild was on the medium-small size, so world bosses were a pain to do: they spawned once a day/ week and took an entire community to kill, but the loot went to **ONE** party out of maybe fifteen full parties. It was one of the reasons the game died. Temporary alliances often form around world bosses: parties were made according to which guilds' leaders/officers do the most DPS and support, so that the loot would go to this party and then the negotiations would begin about which guild gets what. Usually they take turns for first pick.




Anyway. GL wanted more gear, and temporary guild alliances weren't cutting it. She struck a deal with one of the big guilds: allow her in, and they'll allow her DKP from their own stash and exclusively give our guild second pick from WBs, and we'll party up with only them on WBs as support DPS. She also persuaded other officers on US time to join her on their mains with the same promise, effectively turning our little guild into a satellite guild of alts.




I, who was on the other side of the world, was just logging in when this went down. I resigned and pulled all of my toons in protest; I was getting burned out triboxing minor bosses without support, often having people from the big guild come and try to steal kills, and she wanted to wh**re our guild out to them as DPS support so she could have more gear. She tried to persuade me, saying she was going to make me the GL of the small guild. I uninstalled that same day.",2025-04-11 00:54:01,1,LittleStarClove,gaming

Shortly after I joined a member of that group was going off-line for an unspecified amount of time for a particular surgery. It was apparently a fairly high risk surgery so everyone was sort of preparing for there to be not this person around anymore, just in case things went badly.

And shortly after her scheduled surgery date, someone closer to her than me reported that she had passed on. Turns out, no the fuck she didn’t. She was alive and well, but due to the cost of the surgery felt that she could not afford to play the MMO anymore and thought that it would be better to just pretend that she died on the table. this ended up with most of that particular group very, very angry at the individuals responsible for perpetuating the lie, but there was also a small, but extremely vocal minority of people in that group who were adamant in defending this person‘s very poor decision-making.

I had just joined within like a week of this happening, so I basically did that one grandpa Simpson gif from the Simpsons where he walks in to an establishment with Bart sitting there, turns around and leaves.

System Shock (2023 remake) is a bit of a simpler game, but still very immersive. The maps can be pretty maze-like in their faithfulness to the original game, but I still enjoyed ""being lost"" and figuring out where I need to go. It gives some of that old-school feel of minimal hand-holding.

[System Shock 2 is getting a remaster](https://store.steampowered.com/app/866570/System_Shock_2_25th_Anniversary_Remaster/) at the end of June and it's my main recommendation for someone who likes Prey and Bioshock. Prey (2017) was basically the real successor to System Shock 2 that I never got.

In SS2 you have:

* Character progression with things like inventory upgrades, skill points, passive perks, and weapon modification.
* A big spooky ship to explore, filled with horrors. You can write notes on the map.
* Great ambience. The music can be a bit ""interesting"" and I originally played without the music, and the soundscape was still wonderful with the humming and thrumming of the ship's systems and the blabbering of distant enemies.",2025-04-10 12:04:58,3,AmicusFIN,gaming

mm3nfm5,1jty82m,reddit,"System Shock 2 and Deus Ex. Story wise these games can easily top any best written movie.

System Shock 2 with entire story and how it's delivered to the player via just observing things where ghosts of the past in your augments tell you what was happening, but also through one of the best narrated audio logs found across the space ship and some as text logs. Also amazing how certain characters evolve through the game, from protagonist as well as certain individuals and it really conveys the story to you in such interesting way. You really need to experience it and appreciate it that game of such caliber was released back in 1999. Remaster is coming up early this summer so anyone interested, try it out. System Shock 1 was remastered some time ago, also worth trying that one in more modern form. Absolutely worth it as well.

Deus Ex is a bit different, mostly with delivery of different outcomes to so many scenarios as well as interactions with NPC's talking to them, through your comms in the head and also through different logs found through world, quite similar to System Shock 2, partially since some of key people who worked on System Shock were working on Deus Ex too. With Deus Ex, story revolves more around ethics of human evolution and body modifications, transcendence and gods. It's old game now and feels a bit clunky, but it's actually very cinematic with very deep story.

I'd also put Dead Space here because of how similar it is to System Shock in its own way, also delivering very deep story and narration. Maybe it lacks the character of people you listen to unlike with System Shock 2 where you kinda really connect with the people you listen to through audio logs, especially their accents which were really wild. But it's there and it's conveyed to the player in cool way. It works.",2025-04-08 20:55:51,2,StaticSystemShock,gaming

mod6lw4,1k4v4tq,reddit,"for forza (and to a lesser extent real life) AWD for speed, RWD for fun. AWD is statistically the fastest. it has higher acceleration, and the weight penalty is minimal in comparison. However RWD is more fun imo. it lets you kick the rear tires out easier and usually has less understeer compared to AWD. however the downsides are its harder to control, lower acceleration, and being basically useless offroad. FWD just kinda.. exists... its mainly designed for economy cars as its the lightest of the 3 drivetrains, and its downsides are only seen at racing speeds. however, forza is a racing game... so dont use it. its only in the game for accuracy's sake and i think only about 60ish cars in the entire game can use FWD out of 500+. FWD's main downsides are horrid amounts of understeer and the worst acceleration out of the 3 drivetrains. it does have the small upside of being better than RWD at offroad but pretty much any class B and up car will require AWD to be fast offroad anyways.",2025-04-22 02:27:34,6,Brett983,gaming
mod6106,1k4v4tq,reddit,"That's a very complex subject that depends a lot on the specific car, how it's set up, what the power levels are, and where the engine is. There are entire books dedicated to discussing various car setups and how to use them.

In very general terms, a classic race car is/was real wheel drive. When you accelerate, weight is transferred to the rear and this is a good thing for traction over your drive wheels. Separating power from steering helps with tire usage and traction as well, and because of how the weight works you can get a good front/weight rear ratio with the engine in the front, transmission down the middle, and a differential in the back.

Front wheel drive tends to be less than ideal for a fast car. When you accelerate, the weight shifts off the front wheels and thus reduces traction, which isn't ideal. Combining power and steering also reduces the effectiveness of it, and having the engine and transaxle up front tends to make them front-heavy.

However, FWD's main benefit from a driving standpoint is they tend to be easier to drive and recover from. If they understeer (push towards the outside of the corner), you can generally just steer a little more and give it power to pull out of it. If it starts to spin out, countersteer and power out of it and just goes. This makes it a little safer for passenger cars and a little more straightforward for newer race drivers.

Rear wheel drive is more versatile for handling - by balancing steering, throttle input, and just the right amount of weight balance a skilled driver can really control the car exactly how they want, and generally pull better times than an equivalent FWD car because of the weight transfer, traction, and general handling characteristics.

AWD, on the other hand, is kind of its own thing that, depending on the car and setup, can combine the best of both worlds. Most cars aren't fully 50/50 AWD though - some are rear biased split, some front split, some primarily FWD or RWD unless slip is detected, etc - lots of different varieties. In general though a good AWD system can combine the benefits of both by having rear wheel power for accelerating while having front power to steer and handle under braking in corners. This is why a lot of supercars and other high end sports cars tend to be AWD.

All of this is very highly variable and dependent on the car and driver skill of course. A very well tuned FWD car with a driver who knows how to handle is it going to turn some very good track times. A poorly balanced RWD car with a bad suspension setup is going to struggle in corners. Not all AWD systems are created equal. But those are the generalities. There are books like Going Faster by the Skip Barber racing school that gets into it some, and [even a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-sGV2XXUeU).

Edited to add: Forgot to mention mid and rear engine cars, like an MR2 or Porsche 911. These have all the advantages of a RWD car (weight and traction over the drive wheels) while also usually being rear weight balanced. This means with a skilled driver they can do some pretty fantastic handling by letting the rear end basically turn itself, but does mean they can do things like snap oversteer with improper throttle control. Adds a whole new dimension to everything.",2025-04-22 02:24:08,9,Scoth42,gaming
mod95ok,1k4v4tq,reddit,"My time to shine.

FWD has engine power being sent to the front wheels of the vehicle. The front wheels are also in charge of steering the vehicle and provide a majority of the braking force.

FWD cars have the most difficult time getting around corners because the front wheels are dealing with the forces of cornering and trying to put power down. These are just forces competing for priority, and they affect handling negatively. What can happen is something called ""understeer,"" where you turn and accelerate, but the car just pushes straight forward, even with the wheels fully turned.

High-powered FWD cars also can suffer from ""torque steer,"" which is when the power/torque from the engine forces the steering to turn towards a direction. What happens is you floor it, and the steering wheel will start turning in your hands to the right, and you'd have to fight that while driving quickly on a track.

RWD cars are considered the best layout because they don't suffer any of the things that FWD cars do. The front tires can just focus on braking and cornering. All the engines power is moved to the back wheels on the vehicle. The thing to watch out for is ""oversteer,"" which is the complete opposite of understeer. You turn the corner and accelerate hard, and the rear end can swing, causing you to spin out.

RWD was the standard layout until the 1970s when FWD cars became more popular.

AWD is a combination of the two. You can get understeer like a FWD car,  but it's a minor issue when you consider the substantially large benefit of all four wheels being powered. It offers a HUGE amount of grip and is incredibly stable in poor road conditions.

Will AWD/4WD make you invincible on roads with poor conditions? Absolutely not. You still need to be cautious in poor conditions, but it allows you to be more sure footed in it.

The difference between AWD and 4WD is that AWD is either full time or automatically switches between FWD/AWD without the ability to manually choose which you use. 4WD allows the driver to stay in 2WD mode until they manually switch it into 4WD, like on pickups.


I am by no means an expert, but I know a VAST amount of what and how automotive systems work.",2025-04-22 02:42:55,7,xAsilos,gaming

It can suffer from the same issue where returning after time away you might not want to keep going, but it feels really good to restart from scratch in these games because you now know the level layouts and can progress really fast with less stress.

2. ""Forever"" games like Civ. (civ 5 or 6 are best) would be really good for your situation where you have tons of time in spurts where you can really dive into a game (and hopefully finish one). Then after your next trip you can just start a new game.

after that animation happens, the character who got in the car will repel away from the other player like two similar polls of a magnet. when you run towards them, the car they're in will slide away from you, sometimes shooting up into the air. you can use this to get on top of buildings you aren't supposed to be on, etc. but it doesn't push you TOO far away, since there is a limit to how far the characters can go from each other.

On certain variations of [this screen](https://thekingofgrabs.com/2023/09/21/montezumas-revenge-colecovision/#jp-carousel-273294), one of those chains will appear on the lower-right ledge, just above the ladder. If you time it right, you can jump from the ledge in the center, over the conveyors, and down to the tip of the ledge in the lower-right, just as the chain disappears. If you have zero lives, the fall will kill you and end the game. When the chain reappears, it will then kill your ""corpse"" and give you unlimited lives.

The lives aren't really unlimited, I just didn't understand what was going on at the time because I was 5 years old. Those with a programming background might immediately intuit why this happens. Basically, the ColecoVision used an 8-bit CPU, and the game allocated 1 byte of memory (2^(8)) to store your extra lives. Total lives were stored as an unsigned integer, meaning the number cannot be negative. Whenever you took damage, the game would decrement total lives by one. Once your lives reached zero, it would display the ""Game Over"" screen, however, there was no programming logic in place to check if you had zero lives and then died again. In this scenario, the game would just subtract another life anyway. Since the CPU uses modular arithmetic to operate on the unsigned integer, this would result in integer underflow. The value in the register (CPUs internal memory) would wrap around from 0 (0000 0000) to 255 (1111 1111), because those are the minimum and maximum values the register can hold.",2025-04-07 23:45:08,1,spookynutz,gaming

moy9orn,1k6ttbl,reddit,"I know you said no fighting, but the fighting is super duper easy in this game, and it only takes up a very small portion of the game:

Dragon Quest Builders 2!

It's like a cuter version of Minecraft, with an actual story. You play as a builder, a type of person who, well, builds. But the children of hargon, a religious sect intent on (literally) destroying everything (unless it's their armor, their weapons, their slaves, their ships, ect) are rounding up the builders to take them to a prison island. You find yourself on a boat in the beginning, learning the basics of how the game works while fixing up the ship for the monster crew. They might be literal slave-drivers, but that doesn't mean you can't be nice, right? A massive storm hits, and you end up getting thrown overboard, only to wake up on a mysterious island. This is where the game *really* starts. You discover an old hermit ghost who teaches you the fundamentals of building a little further, and as you build up the island, you go to various story islands to help them out, learn new recipes and new skills, and to meet new people to bring back to your island.

The main reason I bring this up, is when my niblings were a little younger than yours, this would help them read, as when the npcs ask you to make something, they highlight the specific word in orange and put a picture next to it, like "" you need pot 🚽, a towel 🧻, and a light source 💡, to make a bathroom"". It should be noted when they ask you to use a specific thing for a quest, you need to do it as specifically as they say, or the quest won't count as completed.

As for the combat, it's very simplistic. You have a energy % for when you need to consume food (using tools or your weapon makes you sigh every use if your food is 0%, but can be ignored by jumping and doing the action midair). In addition, enemies have a very noticable attack, usually glowing red before a big one, or doing a type of movement that's more of a tell before an attack. You can run in, swipe swipe, back up, and repeat without ever getting a scratch on you. And if you DO die, you just wake up in bed, no biggie (unless it's a boss fight in which case it brings you back to before the boss fight)

Again, highly recommend, super fun and cute, I think they'll like it.

Edit: this is just one of many of the stories you can discover in there, of course, but this is the one that sticks in my head the most.


Spoilers ahead for those who play.

There was this psionic species, capable of interacting with the shroud. They would regularly use it to indulge themselves, but to some of them, dark whispers in corners of their mind, something horrible, but, maybe it was just their imagination? Eventually this splintered the population into two groups. Ones who swear off the shroud entirely, and others who indulge in it freely. The shrouds corruption steeps in them, until it finally takes hold, binding them to the shroud, turning them into grotesque shadow monsters, consuming all matter to feed the all consuming shroud. The galaxy fought bravely, but the end was near. Despite their best efforts to fight off this galactic crisis, that splintered group from before, as powerful as they were, were no match for this endless hunger, until it was discovered, by accident no less, them dying under specific circumstances (that I unfortunately didn't retain) turns the body into this blue dust, that significantly boosts psionic abilities. Just a glimmer, but it's hope. Volunteers line up, elderly, those no longer desiring to carry on, but its not enough. The hunger grows. The remaining populace unanimously decide there is only one option. All but one turned to dust, in one final burst of psionic energy to push it back to its trans-dimensional pocket, locking it away once more, before waiting in solitude for deaths sweet respite.",2025-04-23 18:59:02,1,Firegem0342,gaming

mourdsp,1k5sg5g,reddit,"Enshrouded is the survival experience Ubisoft would put out. Hold your hand and point you to places. I like the game but feel it takes away from the sense of discovery when you explore. It also lacks any feeling of epic travel. Combat is better but the zones aren't all that great. More to do I guess; if that's your thing. I didn't like the building in it; it was ok but there was nothing stopping me from building ridiculous things that literally would defy physics.

  
Valheim is amazing for the first 3/4 of the game. As most have said once you hit Mistlands it has some gripes, though the dungeons and end boss of that zone are still really good. Ashlands was a dud for me; they focused too much on Multiplayer so the solo experience really leaves something to be desired. There is EPIC travel in this game but it's also an extreme time sink as you have to find everything and the world is huge so sailing is a must which is the EPIC part. lol  The building is great and has restrictions so requires more thought and creativity.

mnxd96a,1k2pjgy,reddit,"Yeah so, for reasons I have a lot more time and want then my friends to play stuff and I’m tired of always playing stuff alone. So before I left for work I redid a room in my house and made it an office / streaming room. 
Spent stupid amount of money of new 5090 + 9800 combo, got lights and a green screen.

Trying to piece together some overlays and stuff and I want to do some funny shit like viewers being able to «flashbang» me w channel points of something (just make all lights in the room flash) also looking at which games I could play w viewers 

So I work in a 2 week on 4 week off rotation. For the upcoming 4 weeks off time, from Tuesday the 29th I’ll be full timing 4 weeks and see how it goes. The goal is really to have more social gaming experiences and make some friends along the way.

Anything beyond that would be a huge bonus 


Twitch having such a low bandwidth is kinda off putting but I think multi stream to yt also so if anyone wants 4K 60fps they can get it there. Twitch seems easier to build a community?

Games I like : Escape from Tarkov, Arma Reforger, Star Citizen, Valheim, silly stuff like REPO 


I usually go DEEP in every game I play

Edit; I guess more is better. Here is a few GTA vids I made some years back

It's me V3LCR0 from Sticky Fingers Gaming\~!   


I missed the last post or two, so let me keep you up to date on what I've been up to!\~   
  
I've been doing about 3 day streams a week, and a spontaneous night stream on the alternate when I'm feeling up to it! Most of them are long so come by and chat if you like Gaming content of any kind, music, and other types of media! 

  
There's two videos in the works/on hold right now for rivals until I have enough ""B Reel"" to be happy, so look out for those if you like Rivals!

I do not have a schedule, but I'm most often streaming between the late nights, to early mornings! Can't catch my stream? That's okay\~! I update the best of the best as shorts on my channel as they are edited!

In regards to a more modern PS2 ""feel,"" there was also a remaster of Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven. Believe it was an SNES RPG, but it's a definite lower budget but great quality treatment of an older game. Due to that lower budget, it may emulate that feel you are looking for. As to whether or not the SaGa series and it's quirks are for you, that's a whole different discussion haha

I will edit if I think of anything further. For the future, highly recommend you keep in mind that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 releases at the end of the month. Though it looks quite pretty and maybe not as ""PS2 jank,"" it has by all accounts made it's mission statement to be a faithful new entry in classic turn based RPGs and easily my most anticipated game this year as a PS1 era RPG enthusiast!

The secret of games were more Action RPGs but the fact you needed to utilize a menu, equip weapons and armor... it helped me figure out how navigating menus worked. How shops work, how classes work.

Cause, I thought, if its boring then I can entertain myself or at least spend time analyzing or thinking about other stuff, or at the bare minimum, watch a video on the side to entertain myself.  I played Balan Wonderworld and I think that game at its worst is just boring (outside of the minigames/balan bouts) but I can genuinely see why some people would enjoy the game if you don't compare it to every other video game you've ever played in the past 20 years showing you what a good game is like.

So Knack, I was expecting it to be similar.  Very mediorce and plain, but had at least SOMETHING interesting to analyze, right?  Right?....no.  The game is so painfully by the numbers you can see every single decision the developer made as it happens on screen.  The story is lazy, the gameplay mechanics are basic and uninspired, and the game is nothing but a fancy way of showing how many loose particles they can have on screen.  Like I said, I can tolerate boring games, but this was *REALLY* pushing it.  In comparison, Balan was bad but all the things it got wrong were FASCINATINGLY wrong.  Like if you try to figure out why they made any decision in that game, you'll immediately become confused and have to piece it together like you're solving National treasure.  Knack?  No. The reason for every single decision is so plain and so obvious that there's nothing interesting in what he does right OR wrong.  Special moves are there as screen-clears for when you die too many times.  The villain is the villain cause he's the villain dont think about it.  The only really unique thing is the treasure chests that give you more options if you have more friends who've also played Knack, which is such a transparently BS tactic to try and buy the game for friends.  And even then, it takes too long to get any of the power-ups, including the ones that might actually change up the gameplay.  You might think the size/loose-particle things would be interesting but it's a bullet point on the box and nothing else.  Your size is so strictly controlled, it basically doesn't mean anything besides spectacle.  Katamari Demacy does that better.  Or any of those games where you eat things and grow bigger until you're eating the planet or whatever.",2025-04-05 01:54:07,3,Bladebrent,gaming

Regarding fighting games, I was very much a fan of Super Smash Bros, but not much else.

At some point I played Rakugakids on the N64, and because this game has a cute and silly cartoon aesthetic, it was the first fighting game I felt enamoured enough by to actually learn how to do inputs. I learned how standard fireball and shoryuken inputs work because I wanted to play Rakugakids.

Nowadays I can appreciate Street Fighter and other traditional-style fighting games, of course. I even enjoy games like 3rd Strike with their more technical mechanics, though of course I'm no good at them.

Your whole gameplay was taking big pulls, standing in place and holding fucking spacebar, quests after a while were about getting bear kidneys or other shit that had very low % of drop so you could gather pulls for hours, when you wanted to level you done the same.

GTA 3 100% can be blocked accidentally if you do the missions in the wrong order. Paramedic also sucks and gangs become super dangerous once you leave an island so if you're going for 100%, do everything on one island before moving on

Vice City has better driving though Firefighter and Vigilante are harder. For Firefighter, sometimes people will run down small alleyways and you'll struggle to get to them. Vigilante I would do in either the tank or the hunter helicopter if you're struggling in the car. For ""Demolition Man"", you can kill everyone in the building with the helicopter blades before you pick up the bombs as the time doesn't start until you do

San Andreas is a pretty long game but not everything is required for 100% (the marathons, burglary, stunt jumps are all not required). I would do Burglary anyway to get unlimited sprint. Paramedic I would do in one of the small towns as it makes it go much faster. There is body armor under the bridge near grove street (since you don't unlock Ammunation for a while). ""Wrong Side of the Tracks"" needs you to drive a particular way from the train for Smoke to hit people (though you can just jump on and shoot them yourself).

I'm the same way with TV too. I watched stranger things when it came out and enjoyed it but it got so hyped up that I never watched the rest. I finally watched the rest a few weeks ago and enjoyed it SO much. Like the hype is warranted because it's a great show but it was nice getting to watch it after the hype died down a bit. And now I don't have to wait as long for season 5 as everyone else did!

Ima get BG3 soon because I know it's good but I don't mind waiting it out until a sale! But yea I almost don't like playing or watching stuff that's constantly being talked about, I'd rather wait till after so I can fully form my own opinions.

mn9dcpx,1jzwfnp,reddit,"I dunno, man. I'm 49... 48? 49-ish?

It had some problems, but I wasn't bored.

The game's locations have a gameplay bent to each one. Vatican is where you set everything up. It's more clandestine and stealthy. You spend a lot of time learning the stealth bits and getting all your exposition.

Then Gizeh is much more sprawling. You spend more time around nazis and are free-er to bring them the hurt in a variety of ways.

Sukothai mixes it up with fascists in the jungle. And to be honest, Sukothai's boat transportation is the worse thing about the whole game, but the pockets of playable terrain are fun. I found that you can get around faster by just power sprinting underwater.

I never felt like I was short on action-- but a lot of times I was sleuthing and puzzling and didn't want to agro people. And the fights where everything fell apart and I was mowing nazi's down with machine guns generally felt off-key. It was a lot better when I was sneaking up behind nazis and incapacitating them with a shovel to the groin, or shoving them off a precipice, or whipping the gun out of their hand punching them until their knees crumpled.

My biggest gripe is that I wish the game were third person because I want to feel like I'm directing Indy on screen. But that's just a personal preference.

\[edit\]I played the entire game mostly relying on found, blunt objects for combat. I never used repair kits, and I typically flipped fire arms over to use them as a bludgeon until I was down to the last enemy or two and could get a good cinematic ambush in.",2025-04-15 16:45:56,10,Sinaz20,gaming

You literally just described the Indiana Jones movies. He’s an archeology professor, not Sam Fisher.

I never got tired of punching Nazi’s in the game. Anyone expecting a smooth FPS is kinda missing the point. Indy isn’t a trained killer.

Money is great to buy additional skill books/maps but not required to go out of your way to collect.  I barely fired guns and used stealth and items around me to take out enemies, guns draw attention, and punching/stealth KOs were always satisfying to me (much like how Indiana acted in the movies)

Money and medicine are region locked so you can always go back and complete it if you want, but once you buy everything in that region, any extra money you donate (which is just rp)

The only way to be somewhat safe in to create guilds, and alliances of guilds where you still could attack whoever you want even in your own guild, but that would be logged in and punishable by guild officers.

Guild could implement taxes freely for their member, which would be a system of pay-for-safety.

Guilds could claim 1 city. 

Alliances would be based on trust and would be nowhere written down in game.

Fights would be a mixed of autotarget and skill. When engaging melee combat you could lock on target, but then that would create a mini server instance in which you need to framely dodge and time parry and and attack.  If'you're being lock by multiple target you could only defend one and would need to switch, except for tanker who could defend multiples targets. Casters would lock target too, but would need to play a mini game for each spell to determine the strengh of the spell.

There would be no faction, no defined territories, no cosmetics, no in game shop.

I'd probably want a 2 tier class system inspired by OwlCat's Rogue Trader. Generalized base class -> specialized advanced class.

Each Origin would basically have it's own ""class"" that you can also invest in. So a Republic Veteran would have bonuses for stuff like blaster rifles,  Mandalorian Survivor would have increased melee skills and stealth etc. 

Sith could definitely be more of a shadow behind the threat, but maybe a total of 3 Sith eemies in the whole game, all being unique (and very dangerous).

1) ww2

2) halo

3) warhammer 40k

  
\- A combination of The Long Dark survival mechanics + sniper elite, about a Finnish soldier stuck behind russian lines during WW2 where he is cut off and must survive in a forest in harsh winter. Sandbox survival game. Weapons and ammo limited mostly from stolen german patrols or armoury heist through stealth. There are different ways to escape and finish the game.



\- Life is strange style gameplay, but about a student stuck in a university that is attacked and held hostage by a group of terrorists. You were one of the few student that didn't get captured by terrorists. Again there's light survival mechanics like you need water, food and sleep. But the game focus more on stealth in close quarter environment, you'll be crawling through ventilation tunnels and stuff, using cups to cause distraction and using materials available in university to craft things to help you survive. Heavily incentivise to avoid most combat but also moral dilemma to save fellow student. Again multiple way to finish the game, which heavily depended on how much you explore the university and find clues why the terrorists attacked the university in the first place. There'll be sequels to this where there's a link between villains of each game, that leads to greater conspiracy/thing.

  
\- Xcom2 style game but WW2. I know there's a game for that already but it doesn't seem that great.

  
\- ODST 2 (Helldiver but first person view) with a brand new campaign again featuring burning city and find your way to leave the city full of enemies. Rainy, dark, burning buildings...etc. Also have a bigger firefight mode allow up to 32 players all play on one side to fight and achieve the same (hard) objective. You all start off with basic weapons loadout but as times go by you get better weapon by purchase (some kind of match-only income) and even mobile armour, that help you push toward your objective against overwhelming enemies.

The point of console is convenience. If that’s what you are looking for, I guess PS would be better for you since you mention you play some PS games already. If you didn’t have a PC already I would suggest Xbox (Series X) due to Gamepass. PS has increased their prices recently.

You can collect a maximum of 50 000 so 50kg of negative weight, which is significant, especially for stealth, the lighter you are the less stamina you use and more stable your movement.",2025-04-16 07:14:24,6,MuigiLario,gaming
mnq0phs,1k0dutb,reddit,Games don’t and shouldn’t mindlessly copy reality they should always have a goal. Simulators will try and replicate every factor to get as close as possible but even then the noise money makes just isn’t an important part of the experience. X-Plane tries to be as realistic a flight sim as possible but it doesn’t simulate getting to and from the airport and making sure you have your documents. So if there was a medieval thief sim at that level of detail it would be modelling the weight and space taken of the things you’ve stolen but coins would just need to be tightly packed and then they’d stop mattering.

mlx1evm,1jtdxai,reddit,"As a niche recommendation: The Last Remnant. It's union-based combat where you set up formations and then give each unit orders before the turn starts. The orders are generic, like ""Use physical attacks"" ""Stay back"" ""Flank them"" or ""Use healing"". Each character learns new skills over time (automatically) that you can also choose to deactivate if you don't like them or want them to fulfill a specific role.

The animations for this game are pretty flashy even today. The combat banter is fun too. It's a game where a lot of things happen in the background, like class determination, but the wiki has you covered if you want to go in-depth. Weapon and accessory upgrades are cool too. The plot is definitely not everyone's cup of tea, but I enjoyed it.

It's definitely a niche pick, but I think it might just be what you're looking for. Sadly, the OG PC version has been replaced by a visually inferior remaster unless you own a physical copy, but the game's the same. The optional bosses in some of the sidequests are insane too.

mlws818,1jtdxai,reddit,"Dragon Quest IV. I'm a fan of the NES original, but there's a DS remake with a more ""modern"" aesthetic. In the original, you play through a series of chapters controlling different groups of people throughout the setting. Eventually they come together and you control your party via loose guidelines such as ""offense"" or ""conserve MP."" It's a brilliant, beautiful game with one of the best soundtracks on the system. Yes it can be slow, yes it can be daunting, but overall it is paced very well and I consider it a top 35 videogame. The remake on DS controls normally by default but you can choose to control your party via commands as in the original. 


I've actually thought a lot about this particular concept and found a few games that feature conceptually, emotionally adjacent mechanical systems. 


If you haven't played an RTS, check out Pikmin. You don't fight enemies directly - instead, you must manage your Pikmin population and order them to attack for you. First game is about time management and exploration, second is a dungeon crawler. StarCraft is a game you control totally on your own, but I feel like it hits that bone in my body that wants to command an army and watch it mow down enemies. I prefer the first game and expansion. Nothing beats watching 200 zerglings swarm an enemy base. 


Dragons Dogma has comparable gameplay featuring a crew of AI-controlled companions. 


In Diablo II you can amass an army of skeletons or animals that do everything for you.

mley60e,1jrigad,reddit,"I've played both and they are WILDLY different in tone  and executiin. Avowed is very much a typical Bioware rpg with fantasy elements. Lots of talking and world building. Deep character development and interaction. Story decisions seem as though they can effect later parts of the game and you are given some freedom in your path, though there is a linear path from area to area. Different zones are open world and beautiful, filled with places to explore.

Atomfall is also story driven, but it's very mysterious. Heavy focus on resource crafting, survival, and exploration. It doesn't hold your hand AT ALL, so be prepared to be frustrated if you need guiderails. It seems in my 15 or so hrs that you can complete the game many different ways and you are given almost ultimate freedom in your interactions with characters.

Combat on both is kind of clunky with a heavy focus on melee combat. There are stealth elements for both as well. 

Honestly I enjoyed both so far though I haven't completed either and don't know how the stories end.",2025-04-04 18:17:11,3,Bullseye_Baugh,gaming

The first half of the game, with it’s detective style gameplay is great with very good exploration. The story comes along nicely with some cool narrative choices that will affect the world and how you progress. Definitely a game you can play multiple times and/or save and try different options. The combat isn’t Call of Duty or anything, it’s best to think before you shoot and wait behind a door for unsuspecting enemies instead of going guns blazing as ammo is limited and a few shots will put you down. I’m very impressed with Rebellion on this one. I never got into the Sniper Elite games but will have to give them a try now. I’ve started Avowed, but so far it’s not hooking me.

mlf4t44,1jrigad,reddit,"It really depends on what you're in the mood for.

If you liked The Outer Worlds, then Avowed might be the safer pick. It’s Obsidian doing what they do best — rich dialogue, branching quests, and that classic RPG feel, but now with a first-person fantasy twist. If you're into lore, world-building, and character-driven stories, it’s probably going to hit the spot.

Atomfall, on the other hand, looks like it could be the dark horse. The setting is super intriguing — post-nuclear Britain with a weird horror edge. If it leans into atmosphere and has a solid exploration loop, it might surprise people. But it also feels like more of a gamble until we know how deep its systems go.

So, if you want something more familiar and polished, go with Avowed. If you’re in the mood to try something a bit more offbeat and mysterious, Atomfall might be the more interesting ride.",2025-04-04 18:51:03,1,pictureofmael,gaming

If you’re into complex lore and detailed character development, I’d say go with Avowed.

On the other hand, Atomfall looks like it offers a more unique, action-packed experience with its cyberpunk aesthetic and fast-paced combat. It’s got that intriguing blend of dystopian sci-fi and strategic gameplay that could be a refreshing change of pace.

If you loved Outer Worlds and want something that feels familiar, Avowed will likely be the better choice. But if you’re craving something new and different with a strong focus on action and exploration, Atomfall could be really exciting!",2025-04-05 07:14:15,0,HelloAnxiety1992,gaming

mlcmcp2,1jr4x9x,reddit,"Ever since the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct dropped the console and its games prices, I've been trying to collect some data on console and game prices over the years. I'm '97 born so things like the Sega Megadrive (Genesis for those in N. America), SNES, PS1, N64, Dreamcast are all ""before"" my time. 

The PS2 was my first ever console, it was released at £299 and iirc the standard game prices for the PS2 fell within the £30-50 range. I never personally owned a GameCube but I'm aware of the facts that it was a much cheaper console (£129-149) and that after heavy criticism for the N64's £60-70 price tag on games (and some even exceeding that for both the SNES and N64) Nintendo opted to shift to minidiscs to bring game prices down to the PS2 games' range. Similarly, the og Xbox had a similar price tag as the PS2 at £299 and matched the PS2 games' prices.

Looking back, I realised I was definitely privileged, something I obviously didn't understand back then because we (my 2 siblings and I) had all 3 late-noughties consoles; the PS3, the Xbox 360, and the Wii. Again, my memory might be slightly hazy here since this was nearly 20 years ago now but I believe the Xbox 360 came out at £299 but stepped up its game prices to £50 mark, the Wii was the cheapest system of the 3 at under £200 and its games were the cheapest too falling in the £30-40 range. On the other hand, the PS3 (the original fat one) came it at a whopping £425 at launch with £50 games and Blu-Ray disc support, later on they would release the PS3 slim and super slim both of which were cheaper than the original console.

Following that we entered the Wii U and Switch, Xbox One, and PS4 era, and once again Nintendo delivered the cheapest console (Wii U) at £250 at launch, also taking the 2nd cheapest spot with the £279 Switch, the PS4 was next costing £349 at launch, and the Xbox One was the costliest coming it over £400, all 4 had the games costing an avg. of £60, which made the PS4 the most lucrative out of the 4 and so we only bought that one. The Switch of course had additional costs if you wanted a pair of Joy-Cons or a Pro Controller or if you wanted the upgraded Switch OLED which cost just over £300.

And finally, the Xbox Series X, the PS5, and now the Switch 2. For simplicity's sake I'll only be talking about the versions with disc readers for the Xbox and PS because we bought the PS5 that has the disc slot. So, the Switch 2 will cost £395 and its games are looking to be £75-85? compare that to Xbox Series X/PS5's release prices of £449 and on avg. games falling in the £60-70 range, that's a complete slap in the face.

If anyone can provide me some more information/insights on console and game prices over the years or make any corrections in what I've listed please feel free to. Apologies for the essay 😅",2025-04-04 10:12:29,3,remorse714,gaming

mothn73,1k6ucuh,reddit,"Without knowing for sure, having helped with a lot of launches in a lot of regions, it could be any number of reasons:

1. Maybe ES doesn't do well enough in Korea to justify a localization. A game as big as this with as much text isn't going to be cheap to localize. You're looking at minimum $25K for text localization (without a good job of QAing it) plus another $50-100K in marketing expenses. Let's say minimum $150K to launch on one major platform in Korean, that assumes you need to move 3000+ units for break even on revenue (or maybe net bookings?). Seems small, sure, but what's the market for an older ES game in Korea? I legitimately don't know. 

2. Maybe they missed the deadlines for regulatory review for ratings and decided not to simship there. Korean ratings are their own thing, separate from ESRB/PEGI/CERO, so that's a possible snag. 

3. Maybe they co-published and the co-publisher didn't hit some milestone on time.

mo3xg7d,1k3kpjo,reddit,"Welcome to the club.

For me, it's usually an issue of buying games on sale, whether individually or as part of a bundle, because there's some part of my brain that says, ""Sure, you maybe aren't going to play it *right now*, but what if you want to play it next week, next month, or at whatever point in the future and it's not on sale?  Are you going to pay full price...like a chump?  Are you going to wait for the next sale?  What if it's not as cheap then?  You'd feel like a damn fool for paying an extra buck or two when you didn't need to, right?  Hell, what if it's never this cheap again?""  It's *really* hard to fight that impulse.

I just have to tell myself that if I'm not actually going to play it immediately (or immediately after whatever I might be currently in the middle of), and unless it's truly a rock bottom price (like $5 or less for a major triple-A release or just a buck for an indie title), then it's asinine to buy it in that moment.  Doesn't always work, but I have gotten better about not buying every game I'm even mildly interested in just because it's at a modest discount.  (I'm currently fighting the impulse to buy Void Crew, reasoning that it's not a significant discount, I don't actually know how enjoyable it will be solo since it's clearly aimed to group play, and because Jump Ship looks more like the game I actually want.)",2025-04-20 16:03:35,1,StompsDaWombat,gaming

You can also unlock artifacts that let you customize how you play the game. Whether it being introducing harder rule sets or letting you choose what items you want so you can move away from the RNG mechanics.

Helldivers 2 is also a great game but feels more made for 4 players on higher difficulties. It also doesn't feel like you have much impact on the war campaign in the story because you are relying on others to organize what planets you attack or cutting off supply lines, etc.

mnj97r9,1k14aip,reddit,"The thing about Risk of Rain is that even though you get in runs where bosses just seem impossibly tough, you also end up in runs where you're compounding damage values to the moon and melting bosses ultrafast, and the joy of it all is the constant push to make the god run happen. When you get super familiar with the item catalogue, you start to know which items could break a run wide open, and so the gamble mindset kicks in and you keep fighting, even when its hard. It also gates some content behind some pretty complicated puzzles and hidden things that can be fun to sort out as a team, even if you do end up wiki searching the last few. There are also a ton of incredibly high quality mods for additional items and playable characters. It also has, in my humble opinion, the greatest goddamn video game OST of all time. 

Helldivers 2 is also very stellar, but it certainly is by far the most peak as a 4 player experience. You'll still have fun as a 2-stack, and maybe you can tolerate joining with randos, but just be aware that the progression well isn't endlessly deep or anything at this point. It also keeps getting updates that make it harder to run, so just be aware that what you're running it on may come into the picture. Enshrouded would be your best bet in that regard, in terms of running consistently, and having solid progression systems, and it sounds like it's maybe the safest pick for the two of you, but by my experience, you'll encounter something more unique and special with Risk of Rain 2 or Helldivers 2.",2025-04-17 04:48:09,2,ShoulderNo6458,gaming

But the story felt rather straightforward and simple. Though it was usually a cycle of fetch item for trader so they give you new items then they go ""oh hey there's a big bad over there. You should deal with it"" There is various lore books and dialogs to read or listen too

Difficulty was fine but you also get a lot of options for fine tuning it. Like not eating giving debuffs. Enemy health/damage. Normal enemy and boss stats are separate options: Enemy detection range. Friendly fire for enemies. Enable/disable mulitple enemies attacking at once.
How much you drop on defeat

The building mechanics are good too.


RoR2. Has permanent unlocks for items, characters or skills on the characters.

Runs dont usually go longer than an hour unless you're really trying to but bosses don't feel that spongy

(Note: This analysis is based on release, it may have improved since then so feel free to jump in if this has changed)

The planets being procedural generated sounded good on paper but was executed poorly. 90% empty space with the odd encounter with creatures either way below or way above your level. The storyline dragged, Bethesda's typical fetch or retrieve missions but based lightyears apart. Felt like I was just constantly looking at loading or menu screens with tiny dialogs in between.

I remember back in 2011 I was watching the Video Game Awards and [this trailer aired](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHTE5xg9E-g) for a new zombie survival game called Fortnite. 

I quite literally spent years getting hyped for this game and losing my mind for how long it took. I remember literally buying a beta key online so I could play Save the World.

I was so disappointed when I was expecting an open world survival game and instead Save the World was just some small missions and stuff.

They had less races at the start than either of the precursor games, stupid looking 'cover bubble' dome shields everywhere, and tried to make it more MOBA like in order to appeal to e-sports with the hero system (which failed as it was abandoned shortly after release).

All they needed to do was pick one of the formulas from DOW1 or DOW2 and it could have been great.

All they needed to do was add fast travel to every POI, or far more ways tones and port crystals, more than enough. Or a mount. As it is, you can only go by oxcart to around 5 places, and there's a high chance the cart breaks, and you're stranded in the middle of nowhere.

The phrase ""4X game"" was coined in a review of the first game, and the second built on the first, improving it in every way (though I'll admit some of them were arguable).  3?  3 was so bad it *killed the genre*, an achievement I don't think any other game has pulled off.  Granted, it didn't stay dead, but still.

And the worst part?  Go look up the reviews of any outlet that was around back then.  You'll see them give it a well-earned excoriation.  Then hop on the wayback machine see the reviews that gave it on release- they're *glowing*.  I hadn't seen such praise heaped on such an undeserving piece of trash since Ultima IX, and haven't seen it again since.

It wasn't just the change in focus- the jump from hands-on control of everything to a more distant, ""realistic"" simulation of ruling an interstellar empire is inevitably going to turn some people off, and I accept that.  But CORE FEATURES of the changes didn't work.  Full control tactical combat was replaced with a very barebones command system- but even ***THAT*** didn't work.  My first battle, I selected the small fleet I'd brought and ordered them to attack.

Its a game I've kinda soured on over time.  It was a 4-way crossover between 3 great anime fighters (counting P4 arena specifically) and RWBY, a series that would be great for a fighting game, but you could really feel they didn't want to let character's be ""too crazy"" despite being a team game.  Characters would often have gimmicks from their old games, but tuned down to the point of uselessness (Mai's 'tippers' and Linne's 'dash cancels' for example), and in the case of Linne, it left her with just air kuuga and easy sandwiches.  Vatista just flat out lost her charge inputs.  

I kinda wish we just got a version of this game where they let every character have 3 buttons and they let people have their home gimmicks in full instead of just saying ""they're here"" and nothing else.

It’s a game that has a uniqueness to it, that does provide an experience that is worth it and that is very engaging, but that gets increasingly frustrating the more you progress and look for specific secrets instead of just trying to reach the main objective and discovering random stuff. It starts getting more than tedious to repeat over and over and over randomly generated simple math and box puzzles to get ressources, it starts getting infuriating when you perfectly know how to solve a puzzle but the game just doesn’t give you a chance to try because you never draw the specific combination of rooms in the specific places that you need for the next 10 runs, it starts getting disgusting to know what you need to do in theory but to be cockblocked by the rng over and over because you don’t have the right item, ressources, draw too many dead ends to push forward, etc. The more you play and the less secrets you have left to look for, the worse it gets.

The bumper failure is due to a bad seal where dirt gets into pressure switch that controls the bumper causing it to stick.  

Buy a small can of WD40 Contact Cleaner.  Be sure it's the contact cleaner and not regular WD40 though.  Take the face plate off the controller and spray down the pressure switch with the contact cleaner while pressing and releasing the bumper, reassemble, and congratulations you've fixed the entire problem in 5 minutes.  I'd recommend getting a cheap spudger so you don't damage the casing but not even necessary if you don't want to buy one.

There's nothing near the quality for some reason. I've tried many good controllers that also crap out and have buttons break, and they aren't even as good as the elite 2.


Machenike G5 Pro V2 is a good controller with Hall sticks. I've had bumpers fail twice though. 


Gulikit KK3 Max is also solid, but again I've had trigger issues. 


Haven't tried the 8bitdo ultimate yet. Always got steered away hearing it has a lot of software issues and some defective thumbstick issues as well. 


I wouldn't even spit on a ps5 controller. They're fucking awful. They feel like bargain bin madcatz toys. Just with some useless gimmicks and a trash battery. I pray someone finds a way to use non Sony controllers on the ps5. 


I've just accepted replacing my controller once a year or so. I play very high intensity games, I'm usually achievement hunting whatever ridiculously difficult game I can find so I put my controllers through a lot of abuse. 


If the elite 2 had Hall sticks it'd be perfect but with modified dead zones it's still overall better.

Even as primarily a PC gamer I've always thought that the PS5 controller might be the next coolest thing in what you can do with a gamepad (especially compared to either a Nintendo switch pro controller, and triply so for the boring af Xbox controller), so I bought a PS5 second hand as a gift for another friend about a year ago and it came with a controller, I bought another controller so we'd have two plus the newer one looked pretty. (All official Sony stuff btw)  
That first controller had some stick drift and it was missing a single tiny spring in the right trigger making it easy to hit by accident, I had an idea of the previous owner and figure maybe that raging dummy abused it, probably tossed it. so figure yeah, ok that controller is bust. We start using the newer controller and my friend loved it!  
however after about 4 months of very light use it got some INSANE stick drift, and I KNOW she doesnt abuse her stuff.  
im still salty AF about that, luckily that PS5 isnt either of our main gaming console, so we didnt lose out on much I guess.

Main takeway, **Official/1st party DOES NOT mean quality these days**, and whatever you get, get a warranty.

if you insist on getting something 1st party for PC gaming but your tired of having to buy a new Xbox controller each year, i'd recommend a Nintendo Switch Pro controller. I still have the one I bought about 5 years ago and its held up great with a lot of use. my only gripe with it is the Dpad doesnt feel as responsive as I'd like.

That way you can research how long it will take on htrps://www.howlongtobeat.com & if you know approximately how many hours a week you play can plan out how long it will take you.

Also Alternatively if you don't have much time you can seek out shorter games, replay old favorites & get a few games under your belt to feel good. I also recommend tracking what games you beat using a notepad or even a site like https://GGapp.io like I do. Being able to look back feels great.

Also don't worry about what's new or popular & just play what interests you. If it happens to be new or popular then that's fine, but nothing wrong with playing some older or obscure that peaks your interest.",2025-04-11 06:36:50,1,Ty-douken,gaming

mmj0x0u,1jwj4ag,reddit,The answer is obvious: take a break and/or find a new hobby—gaming doesn’t need to be your entire life or the only way you relax.,2025-04-11 07:50:58,1,neon_hellscape,gaming
mmkfri9,1jwj4ag,reddit,"I've been through this when I was younger, and the answer is going to be different for everyone. There was a point in my life where everything was hitting at full throttle all at once. Kids, wife, house, career, etcetera. I can only share my experience and what worked for me. But a TLDR would be that this is your mind telling you that you have more important things to do. Everyone you care about and everything you've worked hard for is relying on you to succeed. It's a heavy burden. But it's also one that will require you to unwind every once in a while to continue carrying it.

So, make time for yourself. I struggled with this for a bit but found that 4 - 5 am on Saturday/Sunday mornings was perfect. It was before the famoly woke up so could dive into immersive single-player games (or anything I didn't need to be mic'd up for). I was already an early bird for work. This gave me a solid 4 hours or so of undisturbed game time. I'd wake up, grab my coffee, and go smoke while listening to the birds on the porch just before the sun came up. Then, I'd immersive myself in whatever game I was playing. This became like a weekly zen moment that I would actually look forward to during tougher times throughout the week. I quit smoking 7 years ago but still look back fondly on these times. And I'm still waking up early to play video games even though I don't really have to anymore. 

For multiplayer, (mic'd) I'd have to burn it on both ends. Friday or Saturday nights, really. 

But making time will require communication because you're not alone. In addition to the family time and date nights and everything else, you have an SO who also needs their time to unwind. Sure, you need your downtime, but that could mean more responsibilities get shifted to your SO. So discuss it. Pick out times or during the week or day that work for both of you for you to decompress. And vice versa, really. Sometimes, we just start doing shit without really thinking. It's just a few matches or whatever, right? But when our wives are like, ""Yo, wtf,"" we're already on the defensive. 

Gaming isn't a job. Don't make it feel like one. They don't have time limits. A 60-hour game will take 60 hours. Whether that's 3 weeks or 3 months, it's still 60 hours. Just make sure you're enjoying the time while you are playing. One thing that helped me was dropping the backlog. Feeling like I had to hurry through a game just to play another game felt an awful lot like my actual job. So I stopped keeping a backlog and never felt more alive. You ever wanted to replay an old game that you loved but didn't because there are so many games you haven't played yet? Just replay the game you want to play. No regrets. Those other games aren't going anywhere. They're actually only getting cheaper. I like a challenge. I still played all of the Souls games and did challenge runs and whatever else. When I dropped the mentality that I was ""wasting time"" by not advancing through a game, just to play another game, I felt invigorated.

Most importantly, you're basically in a time machine. Before you know it, 15 years will pass, and you'll be seeing your kids going out and doing their own shit. Just like we all do. And it will come out of nowhere. Before you know it, you'll have more time than you know what to do with. My kids are grown, on their own, and (thankfully) successful. I have more time gaming now than I ever did as a kid. So keep putting family first, take time for yourself whenever you can, and know that you'll have plenty of time for your hobbies when the dust settles.",2025-04-11 14:21:02,1,Anubra_Khan,gaming

mlr79ls,1jsnen5,reddit,"✨ **Nouveau Concept de Brawler : Epo !** ✨

Salut la communauté Brawl Stars ! 🎮 J'ai imaginé un nouveau Brawler qui pourrait apporter une mécanique unique au jeu : **Epo**.

🔹 **Attaque Principale** : Epo tire des projectiles comme un mélange entre **Colt et Ricochet**, combinant précision et rebonds stratégiques pour atteindre les ennemis derrière les obstacles.

🔥 **Super** : Pendant **10 secondes**, Epo peut **imiter l'ulti** de n'importe quel Brawler allié ou ennemi sur le terrain, rendant son gameplay ultra-adaptatif et imprévisible !

🎨 **Idée de Design** : Epo serait un personnage à l'apparence futuriste, avec un hologramme scintillant autour de lui lorsqu'il active son Super.

🌌 **Skin Épique – Epo Galactique** 🚀 Epo adopte un look totalement cosmique ! Son corps devient une combinaison spatiale brillante avec des **effets de galaxies mouvantes**, et ses tirs ressemblent à des météorites traversant l’arène. Son Super génère une **aura étoilée** qui le fait ressembler à un voyageur interdimensionnel. Ce skin est de rareté **épique** et apporte des effets visuels incroyables !

J'aimerais beaucoup entendre vos avis sur ce concept ! Pensez-vous que ce Brawler aurait sa place dans Brawl Stars ? 😊

Going into more detail:   
If you work on computers / in computers the new task manager is absolutely horrid as well as ditching the action center.

UAC is a pain in the ass now.

They took away the simplicity of a lot of things to make it look more modern (talking about you ToolTray Icon)

The network Selection methods as well as IPV4 configuration is now hidden behind 3 different submenus. 

Taskview is now crap for multiple desktops.

The TPM Requirements are stupid. Basically any CPU older than 3 years can't run windows 11. And if you can you aren't guaranteed any updates/security.

VBS Is the biggest failure in my opinion (virtualization-based security) People have been having issues with this impacting games as well.

Most of those things you can disable, hide, or just ignore.

Using an ultrawide monitor, the centrally-located start menu and the top-of-screen 'common layout position' drag-to features are a welcome upgrade. I know you could probably mod those things in very easily into 10, but it's a no-longer-supported OS at this point.

In fact, I much rather prefer it gives me suggestions of files/folders/apps of whatever I want to find. Online bing search and turning on edge automatically is very annoying behavior.

3. Has bunch of unwanted bloatware that nobody asked for and as a result take up computer's resources. A lot of people couldn't care less about things like copilot.

4. Has user data telemetry on by default and still can't trust them even when it is turned off via settings. They probably want all that juicy free data to train their AI.

5. Some times pushes ads like X-box live through their right hand corner notification UI. Also has unwanted news information in the start menu. You can turn them off, but why have them in the first place?

6. Forces updates and some times cause you to lose all your work. Can't opt out of updates and Microsoft even patch out loop holes that allowed users to avoid updates. This has been a long lasting problem for several generations of Windows already.

If you really want to give a gift to your kids then I recommend to start with being less of a cheapskate and more of realist.

If you will buy one of those shitty chinese bootleg machines in year 2025 from Ali express then you are horrible parent. Kids at their age are playing CoD, GTA 5 and Fortnite.

Average kid wont be interested those days into gaming on NES or SNES or Atari. Graphics too simple, difficulty too high and gameplay wont catch their attention when flashy looking 3D free 2 play shooters exist.

You want them to tell their class that they game on Soulja Boy console? Do you want them to get bullied?

At least buy them Xbox One S or Switchto share together, both of those are 300 dollars. Dont be a cheap parent. I dont earn much in my country but when it comes to giving a gift to my kids the last thing I want to do is to act like a cheap person.

If they have phone at least give them decent phone games or emulators. That doesnt cost you much and may fit 100 dollar threshold.",2025-03-29 13:46:12,-5,Furry_Lover_Umbasa,gaming

It adds ALL the DLC from the original for free for $10 cheaper than what it was originally released for in 2006 ($60 back then, so I’d say $50 is quite a steal for the amount of hours you can sink into this game). 

The combat is definitely different from more modern takes, but they have updated it from the original and actually added a bit of rhythm to the combat instead of it being the old spam fest it used to be. I think even for the unique aspects of the game it’s worth it (the alchemy and magic spell creation system in particular are things I missed dearly!! The customization is great!) The lock picking system is also more difficult than modern takes but is SO rewarding if you spend the time to learn it and master it! Same for the persuasion system, having to learn how it works and eventually get better at persuading a merchant to give you that extra gold for all the gems and potions you’ve been hoarding is worth it. 

TLDR; if you can get it on gamepass give it a try, it’s still got the unique qualities that made gamers fall in love with it years ago. Who knows, you might find yourself being one of them now!",2025-04-23 13:14:54,1,sirpent16,gaming
moll1tk,1k5y71t,reddit,"Oblivion is kind of like digging up a time capsule filled with both brilliant ideas and janky execution. If you can tolerate potato faces, floaty combat, and a UI clearly designed for 2006 Xbox players, there's actually a weird charm and depth to it that modern RPGs often skip. The quests are way more varied than Skyrim's, and the Dark Brotherhood storyline alone is worth the price of admission. Just mod it a bit to smooth out the rough edges and lean into the cheese—it’s clumsy, but in a lovable, “wow, they really tried” kind of way.",2025-04-23 12:44:20,-5,lolidcwhatev,gaming

Now Bethesda can make a ton of money for a game (oblivion) which wasn’t making them much money, building up their IP (TES), train new employees, etc..

* **Little Nightmares 1–2** – atmospheric, like Limbo but with a storyline

Project Zomboid - feels like old school sims, but with zombies and survival mechanics, inventory management

Baldur’s Gate 3 - DnD madness with a whole story and is absolutely replayable with multitudes of choices in story and character building, as well as endings (also inventory hell management)

No Man’s Sky - space exploration with story, resource management, (and also inventory management lol)

Satisfactory - make your own factory, inventory management, guided by quests 


These are just my favorites atleast :) No Man’s Sky and Baldur’s recently has updates, and they’re both so fun to get lost within the world so I highly recommend those. Both PZ and NMS have customized sandbox modes so you can play it however you want!

mnqpsua,1k20rav,reddit,"I was hoping VR would usher in a bunch of new simulation heavy games and it kinda did. Half Life: Alyx does a lot of neat stuff, though it's very buttoned down in terms of simulation of the player body for comfort reasons and is also not quite an imsim. Boneworks and Blade & Sorcery go in the other direction to the point that it makes some people hurl, but given you can stomach it they allow for an incredible amount of player agency with combat and traversal.

The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners I feel strikes a nice balance between the two, leaving simulation of the lower half the body (walking etc) abstract and simplified allowing it to be comfortable, but hands and arms are simulated including physical weight of objects. Melee combat feels weighty and impactful, while traversing doesn't have the wobble motion of Boneworks and B&S making it much easier to stomach. As games, it and it's sequel are sort of Deus Ex-lite but firmly in ""AA"" territory in terms of production value.

It's pretty slim pickings now, mostly 2D>VR ports these days. Those can be pretty great, but they can never fully take advantage of the VR mechanics.",2025-04-18 11:27:35,2,Scheeseman99,gaming

ABC Mouse is also great but requires a subscription. It’s a bit like if Sesame Street made a huge set of educational games and videos and plopped them all together and gave out rewards for completing educational things. Kids can use the tickets they earn to buy things like a digital pet or a new dress for their character -it’s all fairly benign and also helps teach them about “money management” in a sense in ways most games do not. 

Outside of educational games both Google Play and Apple have their own monthly subscription that gives you access to a huge set of generally-appropriate games that contain no ads. I think they’re like $6 a month, and do have a handful of legitimate gems that aren’t the typical bullshit mind-melting mobile game nonsense.. 

I really encourage going with the educational game route because theoretically it should help with the whole “your kids are now mindless zombies” problem that zoning out on instant-gratification garbage for hours has.

mofmn7g,1k13awr,reddit,"Fun, obviously, but I know that's too broad.

The things that make a game fun are:

👁️: Graphics. People act like you shouldn't care about graphics, but that's a bunch of bollocks. Graphics are one of the (if not THE) most important things in a video game. It doesn't mean they have to be 3D and ultra-realistic (although that's nice too), but the graphics themselves are IMPORTANT. I like graphics that are beautiful, with good art direction, making use of all the latest technology to good effect and is impressive on a technical level. A game can look fantastic for what it does even if it's not super demanding (i.e. Hades) and something like that definitely wins in ""Art Direction"" but personally, my favorite things are the cutting-edge stuff. The stuff with graphics that really push the needle (which is what Doom did in 1993).

✋: Gameplay that is either satisfying, suspenseful, and/or creatively rewarding. I love scary games like Outlast, love building stuff in things like Valheim, The Sims, Parkitect, Rimworld or Minecraft, and I love satisfying gameplay like God of War, Call of Duty multiplayer, Doom, Starcraft, or epic RPGs where I build up my character and reap the fruits of my labor (well not labor but you get the gist): Kingdom Come Deliverance, Final Fantasy, Elder Scrolls, etc.

🧠: A good story that is compelling, unpredictable, and leaves me thinking about it after the fact, rather than something cookie-cutter, predictable, plays it safe, and is boring and/or cringe

👂: compelling voice acting, immersive sound effects, and most importantly, an excellent soundtrack

Obviously a game doesn't have to do all of these things to be good. I mean The Sims isn't scary. You don't get to build a city in Outlast. Rimworld's graphics are barebones. Etc. These things are entirely subjective. One man's fantastic soundtrack is another man's ""bleh this music sucks."" But generally, hitting at least some of these notes (even if it's just one or two notes, if it hits those notes really damn good) means a game will be fun to me.",2025-04-22 14:13:07,1,EggNeckSupreme,gaming

mmf3jr6,1jw2ahi,reddit,"What Rockstar do better than most is that they use missions to bring you across large portions of the map.

Something like Assassins creed will bring you to a new area and give you a bunch of missions, and then you move on to the next area, and do more missions.

In GTA and RDR, you'll get a mission that *involves* you travelling to a new part of the map or seeing something else.

I'm thinking the large scale heists where you fly, drive and shoot your way across the terrain, but there are smaller escort missions that take you out of Los Santos to show you the desert for the first time, and then later, a mission that takes you back into the city. The beauty of those, is that there is immersive dialogue because it's within a mission.

In RDR, the first time I saw Saint Denis was a mission that took me there.. and it's unlike anything else on the map... And you could play the game for 30 hours and then be like 'holy shit, there's a full blown city here too!!'",2025-04-10 17:11:16,3,WeekendInner4804,gaming

mluhfxf,1jtbddv,reddit,"Have you tried any of the Gears of War campaigns?

They are really good.

Gears 1 - got remastered to Gears of War: Ultimate Edition. Probably has the scariest atmosphere.

Gears 2 - still holds up and is actually my favourite campaign of the bunch.  
(This is when they first added the horde mode as well)

Gears 3 - is an epic finale to that trilogy and will probably make you cry.  
(They upgraded the horde mode by letting you build defences in pre-determined locations.)  
(Also they added Beast Mode which lets you play as the monsters you fight in the campaign, its fucking awesome. Sadly they never brought this mode.. yet).  
(They also added a really cool Campaign DLC where you get to play as the bad guy of the first game prior to the first game.)

Gears of War Judgement - A spinoff, they messed with the formula here, experimented in some strange ways. I'm not a huge fan personally because it feels like they watered down the games identity a lot.  
(One honourable mention unique to this game is a multiplayer mode called Overrun, which you can still play with bots I think. Its like horde mode and beast mode rolled into one. One team plays as the humans trying to hold multiple layers of defences, the other team plays as the monsters. I would really love it if they brought this back) 

Gears 4 and 5 come as a return to form with some really nice improvements to the gameplay loop and some new characters. Doesn't quite have the same charm as the original trilogy, but makes up for it with better gameplay.  
(They Massively upgraded horde mode in these 2 games. You can build your defences anywhere now by dragging a 3D printer around the map. They also introduced classes which specialise in a role for the team and you can upgrade these classes as you progress Inbetween games.)  
(Gears 5 also added another co-op mode called Escape, where you have to get out of a monster hive before the poison gas you brought with you catches up. People were able to make their own maps for this mode, so there's loads of levels to choose from. Plus it lets you use your levelled up classes from the horde mode).  
(Gears 5 also has a campaign DLC, which is shorter in length but arguably better quality than its main campaign)

Hope this helps.",2025-04-07 11:26:51,2,HomieandTheDude,gaming

This part is whats important. game journos will scores games differently depending on who made them. Also considering what games lately are praised for stories, Im unsure they can even recognize one :)

  
As to answer to question in my opinion. It depends on the game. Some games are pure gameplay and story is not there at all or just to push action further. Those obviously should be scored heavily on gameplay quality. Imagine if marvel rivals for example was scored on story over gameplay, it wouldnt make any sense. 

On other hand you have story heavy games like adventure games, visual novels and so on. Imagine if Disco Elysium for example was scored on gameplay over writing. It wouldnt make any sense either.",2025-04-04 06:16:02,5,Dealric,gaming
mlc2tf2,1jr52cl,reddit,"This is why some sources pulled away from a number score. All judging is subjective, that's why sports use a panel to reduce bias. Metacritic showed up because of this. Gaming is much more diverse than it was a decade ago, and understanding the reviewers' preferences is important(also reading the review and not just looking at the number is huge)

Generally, most larger publications want someone who is into the genere reviewing. I'd give side scrollers a way lower score than they deserve because I don't get on with the genere. Sometimes out of place reviews are there because it wasn't the right reviewer. 

Once the generes separate a bit further (like music, movies) it will be easier to lock in what makes a good game. Right now, games are kinda lumped into a gaint mess(+sports). Some people really seem to care way too much about games, clearly not designed for them.

mlc2ggd,1jr52cl,reddit,"It depends. How important story elements are depends on the type of game it is. The story of The Last of Us is WAY more important than the gameplay. The mechanics in TLoU are serviceable but not best in class. The game isn't really designed for you to play it more than a couple of times. Yet it remains as a top tier game that I'd recommend to anyone. Why? Because its a story game with a phenomenal story. 

Meanwhile Souls games almost embody the opposite. They have stories and lore and those elements aren't bad but they are rather subtle and can be entirely missed. Instead those titles are built entirely on a ruthlessly well designed gameplay cycle that drives the entire theme of the game. The gameplay offers avenues for the weak to overcome horrific challenges while also allowing for extreme levels of skill expression from those who are dedicated to it. The mechanics tend to be deeply nuanced but simple enough to easily grasp. The story often acts less as an actual story and more as a powerful ambiance to set your epic battles in. 

But something notable is that in both cases every single category in the game will hit a score of at least GOOD ENOUGH. When a game starts falling below that standard they'll start taking hits for their failures. Its why there are so few actually good Souls clones and why some huge AAA titles will have a bad story and suddenly you realize that its gameplay is this horrible hollow chore that gets in your way constantly.",2025-04-04 06:42:25,2,Dangthing,gaming

While it's designed to be played by children it's absolutely not made solely for them and is not dumbed down or stupid or anything, it's perfect for adults too and there are many more advanced ways to interact with it if one likes. It's dirt cheap for the experience you get from it. The blocky nature makes it super easy to read and construct in for everyone, while being just restrictive enough to foster creativity. There are countless ways to enjoy it with friends or alone, not even mentioning amazing mods, it's the most modded game of all times, there's everything, and the game runs on all platforms which is crazy. The art is really mastered, special and awesome imo and the music is some of the best in gaming. I think it's a solid contender for best video game of all times though I understand not everyone is into it. I've been playing it on and off since almost the beginning and I'm not stopping anytime soon. I will say though the updates have made it feel a little bloated with featurs as of lately and the vibe is definitely not the same as the early versions, but it's minor and it's still an amazing game. Cherry on top with the open access to absolutely all the versions of the game you can really really play however you like in whichever version you like and I have yet to see another game do that.

mkhy3rp,1jn8l8k,reddit,"The core of the immersive sim genre is systems-based interaction with the environment that creates emergent gameplay.

My go-to example these days would actually be the Hitman World of Assassination trilogy. Those games operate on a fairly tight internal logic. If you're disguised as a mechanic, you're allowed to mess with electronics. If you put rat poison in a drink, anyone who drinks it will go running somewhere to vomit. Your interactions with the environment have systematic, predictable effects, which allows you to plan ahead and choose to approach levels in your own way.

Compare this to set piece design, like Half-Life. Half-Life is full of pre-scripted special case ""set pieces"" that happen once and then never again. There is a point in the story, for example, where soldiers hear you crawling through a vent and take shots at it, creating holes that let little rays of light through.

mki1c2o,1jn8l8k,reddit,"To me, Simulator part is important, as the game has to simulate some aspects of real life, be it, physics or logics of real world. Need for Speed is not a simulator, but ETS or Forza is, NFS is arcade which isnt real life racing, so if I wanted to drive driver simulator I wouldnt pick NFS. You have mentioned Far Cry, personally its not simulator in any sense as we are protagonist in a video game, in a scenerio written by people, and when we must survive the huge explosion, we will. Its like comparing movies, FarCry is like an action movie. Of course simulator logic I mentioned in the beginning doesnt applies to 4X games as they may be fantasy or sci-fi, but that just remind us that term simulator in gaming is not define per se but per genre and we cannot look for a game simply because its tagged simulator as we will get varied and diluted results.

About the immersive part, its easier to be immersed in game, at least for me as I can quickly soak the game setting and atmosphere, but, immersion is highly subjective, what I may find easy to immerse myself into someone else wont immerse at all. It comes to personal preferences and abilities to enjoy various major and minor things, I repeat, minor things. We often ignore the little joy of everyday life and our lives are grim more and more. So, to summarize the Immersive Simulator I think I would expect game to be cozy and relaxing instead of action packed and overstimulating. **Firewatch** comes to mind and it doesnt exactly fit my POV of immersive sim but we already stated that terms arent defined. Walking simulator might fit into immersive sims category.

u/AlcatorSK already said it better I think. Comparing **Prey** and **The Long Dark**. Comparing RPGs. Nowadays we dive into subgenres as there are more and more titles that blend mechanics from various genres. Some may hate cRPG (**Baldurs Gate**) and love aRPG (**Diablo**). If we talk about Prey and The Long Dark we must define additional tags, be it survival. I have Prey on the list to play and I may be wrong but I feel like Prey may play out like **Control**. The Long Dark is highly immersive for me. Now, that I think about it, my POV may be flawed a little as I didnt bothered to dive into genres that much and my definition of immersive simulator is shallow, glad I came upon this thread.

Reaper IFF for ME2

Also, in the final ME2 mission (you'll know it when you get there) just look on the wiki to find who the best people are for various tasks (again you'll know when you get there) for the same reason. It's worth a little metagaming to avoid fucking up some of the best parts of ME3.

mk95yoy,1jm59th,reddit,"Personally I tend to enjoy the setting of Assassin's Creed games more than even the gameplay or story. The environments that you can roam in is pretty neat and the AC team will include a lot of real world information regarding a lot of the locations that you can visit in game. So, if it were me picking a game, I would pick the setting that most interests me. Enjoy the Renaissance? Go with the Ezio trilogy. These were the watershed games for the series in terms of assassination gameplay (and in terms of story, imo). Do you have a fascination with Vikings? Valhalla might be your game. Interested in the American revolution? AC III is your bet. AC Unity and Syndicate are fun, if you want to tromp around Paris and London, respectively. If you like Greek or Egyptian mythology, then Odyssey or Origins might be your thing. The newest, Shadows, has been fun so far as a self admitted Japanophile.



AC IV Black Flag is probably the weakest of the games in terms of having a interesting setting but the gameplay very much makes up for it. I can't really recommend AC I.

From there, you can either move back to the other 2D games, though I would only recommend Platinum, HeartGold, or SoulSilver, or you can move forward to the 3D games, so it's probably the best starting point for a new player.

None of them are hard in any way. The only thing that's changed is how much you would have to grind, which was reduced in later generations.

As for if they are complex or leisurely, the answer is both. To beat the main story, it is trivially easy. You just keep a team that counters the current roadblock and essentially win automatically. However, there are lots of deeper options to increase the challenge, like insisting on using the pokemon you actually like rather than what solves your immediate problems.

For this, there are more complex options like IVs (individual values, stat bonuses that are determined when a pokemon is born), EVs (effort values, stat bonuses you gain by training against specific wild pokemon), breeding moves (moves a pokemon must be born with through selective breeding), and a plethora of synergies you can use between mons for teambuilding. For example, you can have a Rain Team, where it's all Mons that set and fight in the rain with bonuses.

The Gameboy advance games offer more challenge than the current series but are much easier to play as a new player compared to the Gameboy games. On DS you have what many consider to be the peak of the Pokemon series. Namely Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum. The absolute best games all around, usually agreed apon by many fans are the Heart Gold and Soul Silver games. I’d have to agree that those two games are the absolute best Pokemon games. I wouldn’t play them first tho. I started on Yellow back on Gameboy Color and that can be challenging for people who haven’t played on a Gameboy or are younger and not used to pixel graphics and menus. I would say the best games to start with would be on the Gameboy Advance. Get FireRed or LeafGreen. Sapphire or Ruby. Can’t forget emerald! I’d start on there and then move to the DS games from there. Plenty to work with and not brain-dead difficulty like the newer games on switch. They make it too easy these days. You can of course make Pokemon more challenging by adding rules to your play through. I like to play the game with what I call “gym leader” rules. All your Pokemon must share a type, and you cannot use any items in battle. (If you are struggling you can do what the actual gym leaders in the games do and use just one healing item per battle).

So I'll explain the differences.

Lets say in an area In pokemon blue. You can fight an oddish. Well in pokemon red that area has a bellsporout instead. There are these differences throughout all the pokemon series.

Now later games Theres certain legendary pokemon that are only in 1 version of the game. So the story slightly changes with the corresponding legendary pokemon.

Some trainers I think are different depending on the evrsion your playing.

But overall your playing the exact same game with either version.

You might question why this was made this way and ill explain that as well.

You see when pokemon first came out there was no internet in videogames. So the pokemon company made a cable that connected 2 gameboys together and let you play against or trade pokemon with a friend. 

This was a major success and made more gameboys sell and pokemon copies as well. So they kept this formula to today. Sure you now have internet and can trade with anybody.

mk8kbd3,1jleam2,reddit,"I've played all except sword, shield, sun, and moon. They're not particularly complex at all. Rather the opposite. a few of them of note:  

Emerald (ruby/sapphire) have the pokétch, a watch app that lets you do various things from counting steps, writing notes, a clock, and more. They also have something most other games don't: *Contests!* I loved these things. Your pokemon uses moves like in a fight, *but* unlike a fight, they won't use pokemon types for the moves, instead an aesthetic, cool, smart, beauty, and a couple others. Your job in the contest is to have the highest score in that particular aesthetic.  
You can also find the TM hidden move, and use it on various locations to create a secret base, decorating it with plushies, furniture, and other things.  
These 3 will **always** be my recommendation for a new player. They're my absolute favorite and (counting these 3 as one game) are one of 3 games I've ever 100% (the other two being twilight princess and shadow of the Colossus)

Platinum (diamond/pearl) one of the better 3d games imo, it has a underground game feature, where you dig underground and explore this labyrinth of rooms with random pokemon, some you can't get till much later in the game, or at all above the surface. You can create a base like previously mentioned, but the main decorations are pokemon statues, which affect which pokemon you find in the underground. You can dig into the wall at any spot with a glint, and chisel away to find treasures.

The newest ones are scarlet/violet  
3d, much more open world, travelling on the plot mandatory pokemon is extremely irksome. I can't count the number of times I've accidentally run into pokemon I had zero interest in battling. Trust me, walk unless you have to.  
Ignoring that slight, while it feels like the world is far more open, there's a lot less to do. You follow 3 main routes, defeating the gyms, defeating the gangs, and defeating the titan pokemon, which upgrade your overvalued ride. Did I mention you can't use him in battle at all until you finish his story? Literally just a scooter pokemon. -_-  
There are plenty of new pokemon, with some really weird evolution requirements, like with pawmo, you have to walk 1,000 steps with it and then level it up to evolve, either via GO, or in game. Now, this wouldn't be a problem if your pokemon walked at the same speed as you. *It does not.* Another example, bisharp I think? You have to have it defeat another bisharp, *in front of the pawniard group* before it'll evolve, *while it's holding something specific*. 

It's not a ""bad"" game, but the previous iterations are all much better. Personally, the 3d games just don't hold up against the 2d versions. Better storytelling, better gameplay features, and much better graphics imo. I'll take 2d sprites over 3d toy dolls any day.",2025-03-28 19:32:11,1,Firegem0342,gaming

You should rate a game based on the most pure and unmodified experience possible, so you can be impartial and actually understand what makes the game good or bad, what the devs got right, what they could’ve done better, and whether they learned from past examples or just repeated the same mistakes.

If there’s a major enhancement mod, log it as a separate entry. In my backlog, for example, I have two entries for Castlevania Circle of the Moon: one for the original game, and one for the Card Mode patch that fixes the RNG nonsense and makes the game way more enjoyable. Same goes for the Mega Drive Sonic games — I have the originals, the unofficial decompilations, and the Origins versions all listed separately, because they each bring different pros and cons that justify different ratings.

But if you played the game for the first time using mods, just be transparent about it when talking about the experience. As long as you don’t act like the modded version is the “default” version of the game, that’s totally fine.",2025-04-20 21:44:48,5,tiozaorobbie,gaming

But some games are made to be modded and they can add ALOT to a game.  Games like One step from Eden, Slay the Spire, or even Minecraft have near endless replay value because of all the mod support.

* I hated the use of a silent protagonist, and was glad they returned to a voiced one in FC6, or at least one with an identity. Everyone calling you ""Rookie"" even though you're leading the fight against the cult was so annoying. The dialogue goes so far out of its way to avoid using your name and it really hurts the immersion
* I was looking forward to seeing how they'd explain how a Far Cry story would happen in the middle of the US. How would a full-on civil war go on inside an otherwise functional country without intervention from the government? Alas, they never really bother addressing it. I think it would have worked better if they set the game in the early 90's, to help account for slower communications. At first I thought it actually was set in the 90's until someone referenced Obama.
* I was also looking forward to a controversial narrative with based-on-real-life religious extremists as the villains. Instead they're just a vague cult that hardly mentions Christianity, and I felt it robbed Joseph Seed of a lot of nuance. Also, most of their ranks aren't even true believers but are hypnotized by a drug.

I find those to be the most boring, artistically bankrupt menus I’ve ever had the misfortune to use.  And that’s BEFORE I start bitching about the slow ass cursor some of these games insist on using.  Sometimes they do something cool, like FFXVI or AC Origins having your character frozen in place in the menu.  But most of the time they’re boring, and also weirdly unintuitive to move through.

Give me a real PS2 or PS3 chunky menu design any day of the week.  They don’t all have to be out of this world like Persona, but like Kingdom Hearts, Final Fantasy X, Yakuza 0/Kiwami, these all have excellent menus without being as awful to look at.",2025-04-14 02:19:31,3,Sonic10122,gaming

mn053sl,1jyntup,reddit,"I have a couple gripes about gaming today.

1. The whole model has been inverted. Instead of 1) make a fun game, and ***then*** 2) make it look as pretty as possible with whatever budget remains, now it's 1) spend 90% of the budget making it look pretty and ***then*** 2) try to quickly slap together something resembling a game with whatever budget remains. Why not just make a movie out of it instead since the result will probably be barely playable anyway? 
   1. Maybe instead of spending 9-figures on a single massive game, make a dozen smaller games and try out some new ideas.
      1. Odds are enough of the games will do well enough to cover the costs of the others and then some.
      2. Studios and publishers aren't risking large amounts of money on any one title, allowing them to take chances on new IP.
      3. Gamers get more games to play.
      4. You may even find your next big title that way, like happened with Monster Hunter.
2. Gaming has been completely stagnant since the 90s when 3D games became a thing. It doesn't matter if you've never even heard of Wolfenstein 3D, if you've played literally any other FPS over the last 30 or so years, you'll be able to pick it up almost instantly. The only things that have really changed are some minor QoL improvements over the years. Like regenerating health instead of having to hunt down health packs. Every console generation gets more powerful, but the only thing that additional power is used for is higher resolution graphics. 
   1. How about some improvements in other areas? Just a few ideas/suggestions:
      1. Characters that don't move like they have a fused spine
      2. Clothing that doesn't look like it's literally glued to the character's skin
      3. Improve the physics for things like character model hair 
      4. Make it so characters don't seem to be moonwalking at times like during cutscenes where their feet don't seem to have any friction with the ground
      5. Give us something better than the same ragdoll physics that has been around since the NES days. It doesn't have to be 100% accurate, but at least try to get some of the basics correct
      6. Use raytracing to create more immersive soundscapes. 
      7. Let characters climb up on things in the environment in at least a semi-realistic way. If you could do it IRL, the character in the game should be able to do it. 
      8. Stop making chiropractor porn with female characters",2025-04-14 03:08:39,2,FreddyForshadowing,gaming

Today, your rank goes up, your teammates' ranks are low, and you are expected to carry them against people who are going to dunk on them.

It is designed to try to manipulate you into playing more. Instead, it has put me off from playing games that have it altogether.

2) Microtransactions everywhere. I don't care that the game costed as much as the GDP of a small nation to produce. It is not the customer's responsibility to help you make up for your losses. Learn to budget or keep your scope small so that you can make a profit by making video games.

Most games stories are just „you are a dark and griddy protagonist who we tell you is morally grey but the story never touches on that and you fight against the one dimensionally evil antagonist to save the world or avenge someone and your one hundert percent correct in what you are doing because the thousand of enemy you kill are either not human or are just evil for the sake of being evil.“ 

Games with stories that actually try to challenge the player by presenting a moral dilemma either flop or become the target of culture warriors who farm engagement by presenting half truths or straight up misinformation. And games were you play a character who is so obviously the bad guy always attract hordes of people saying „actually the protagonist was totally justified committing genocide“

Meanwhile gamers gobble down f2p, season passes, live service, digital games, gacha, online only and dlc to then blame not the executives but devs for the state of the industry never realizing thy then self are to blame because they chase the jingling keys (cosmetics, scoreboards, sexualized characters, big IPs or lootboxes) for the sake of blind consumerism instead of supporting innovative gameplay, good visuals or stories that take risks.",2025-04-14 14:07:44,1,Kyaruga,gaming

So many games that release today have this crazy culture of either they are the best game ever with no issues whatsoever. Or more often than not and more frustratingly in my mind is how many games that are at worst meh and often enough pretty decent get absolutely lambasted for their mistakes while ignoring what was good. 

It’s just absolutely frustrating.  Like. I love Baldur’s gate 3 and I’m super glad it’s done well. But it’s definitely got some flaws. And then there’s games like Star Wars outlaws that was a decent game and pretty cool Star Wars title. But because it was made by Ubisoft. It’s automatically a terrible game with no redeeming features. Which is just silly. Especially since even its real gameplay issues have been tweaked and fixed over the past couple months since release.

Basically “Honey I Shrunk The Kids” where you are a kid shrunk down in a garden and have to fight insects to survive.

But on survival, crafting, weapons and armour, fighting bugs, bosses and robots, building a giant base (optional, but great fun).

Great story, excellent exploration, decent progression and extensive NG+ material making me replay again and again and again (you’ve got to get to NG+4 to unlock everything) never once did I find it repetitive, boring, too easy or too difficult. The bosses were hard, but my skills and weapons kept improving, I died a lot but I took it as a challenge and went back and fought again and again to get it done and I did eventually.

I platinumed it easily and carried on going, that’s practically unheard of for me, usually that’s when I have had enough. As an adult with little time to spare, this was easy to pick up and put down with small amounts of time or long runs early in the morning before I had to get out and do stuff, this absorbed me for a long while and I will definitely be going back again and again.

The multiplayer is great too, just have multiple people running around doing their own thing or you all gang up and run through parts of the storyline together. 

I’ve spent a long time on it, with my partner building and farming for materials whilst I go out and kill stuff. Farming insect parts to build better weapons and armour for us both, so we can go do parts of the storyline.",2025-04-14 05:43:32,1,uk_com_arch,gaming

You won’t find Albinaurics in Raya Lucaria despite their magic innateness yet you’ll find them wondering the land around it like vagabonds. However it’s not the first generation albinaurics capable of speech and using magic, you won’t find a single one of them the entirety of Liurnia that isn’t hidden in some fashion. Instead it’s the second generation which are much more primitive, wielding makeshift weapons. 

It makes you think, why are those spell casing Albinaurics nowhere to be seen in the land of magic, yet there’s tons of the primitive ones roaming everywhere? Why are they only ones you meet hidden away? Tucked away at the end of caves, hidden in some rafter, or getting tortured by the local torturer, getting their faces skinned off! Where are they?

Than as you keep playing the clues start to come together. You learn they’re shunned and are on a pilgrimage though for some reason it’s just the first gen ones. And finally you come across the entrance of the Haligtree and that “ahh” moment hits you. All of those first gen ones are guarding it. At that moment you think you finally cracked it, but then you start wondering about the nature of the location they’re guarding. And why are the second ones not there? Why in gods name are some of them hanging around some guy who calls himself the lord of blood!? Why is this lord of blood the only person who’s willing to accept them? 

It’s like huge web of never ending lore. It’ll never end either, Fromsoft wants to keep you intrigued. Wants to leave some of the imagination to the player.

Get the Trilogy bundle on the Wii U e-shop. (Also not the easiest method.)

Advancing the game in the context of modern shooter and game design, innovating in ways that could change the industry. However, it really seems like a remake of Prime more than a sequel, after watching the footage if you told me that this was a remaster of the first game I'd believe you. It feels silly to look at a game like this coming out in 2025 after I played Half Life Alyx five years ago.

  
I don't know how many times I can play Metroid in which you lose all of your equipment at the beginning, then have to backtrack through a gigantic spaghetti maze, all to gain access to different rooms you saw 10 hours ago. I think Nintendo could create a compelling and sprawling space adventure game where Samus is actually a bounty hunter and where the gameplay reflects that. Physically flying your ship, upgrading its components, taking on bounties that lead you to different planets and alien races.

I try to play other games but I always go back. The versatility of builds, weapons, playstyles, casting and how satisfying the combat feels just isn't matched by anything for me. 


I do enjoy lots of others games, I love a great story and worldbuilding and there are lots of games that have that. But Elden Ring is just... like coming home. 


Sekiro was pretty epic as well but I am not a good player so I never beat the final boss of that. But man, when that combat goes well it is one of the most refined experiences I ever had am I'm sure one day I'll try to play it again. It felt so smooth, so dangerous, so precise and then sound of a perfect parry was just addictive.


I have more like feel good games that I can't really delete. Uncharted series, skyrim, mass effect trilogy, Horizon series, Witcher 3, Cyberpunk, god of war 18 and ragnarok, the last of us 1&2, Ori series, Jedi Survivor, Titanfall 2, RDR2, Sniper Elite series, Wolfenstein series from new order onwards, need for speed (a few), assassins creed odyssey and far cry 4 and 5.

mklbl7n,1jnn1lo,reddit,"At their core, JRPGs are about recreating the 'group of friends on an adventure' vibe of a shonen manga.  They're about railroaded experiences with prescribed plots.

There are lots of JRPGs where the game will allow you to make superficial world-building decisions, like how the endgame of Chrono Trigger has a bunch of side quests that influence the endings you get, but there aren't really JRPGs that do the western RPG thing you'd get from a game like Baldur's Gate 3 because that's not what JRPGs are for.

The closest you'd get is probably Atlus's MegaTen games.  Those usually have a branch in the middle that lets you change the path you're on.  But that's less of a ""choices matter"" and more of a ""choose which preset linear path you want to experience"".",2025-03-30 22:20:01,16,funkme1ster,gaming

The idea of choices matter is pretty antithetical to JRPGs because they are almost universally  trying to specificall create a shonen-style friend group adventure and are by design very linear experiences. Even when JRPGs do have choices like the recently re-released Xenoblade X or Metaphor, they are usually self-contained and rarely affect the greater story as a whole.

Basically, JRPGs almost by definition have a set story and you're just along for the ride in 99% of cases. Even games like Triangle Strategy or Fire Emblem with a little more freedom are nowhere close to traditional Western RPGs when it comes to choices.

The whole choices matter thing is really a staple Western RPGs and specifically CRPGs like Baldur's Gate and immersive sims like Dues Ex and Vampire the Masquerade.

Origins was dark fantasy with elements of slow paced strategic gameplay, 2 was a hack and slash, Inquisition found the best of both and then Veilguard completely overhauled the tone, art direction and again removed the slower paced combat. There couldn't be a ""Core"" audience with Dragon Age, with Core Expectations, because each entry was so disjointed.

Mass Effect in comparison kept a specific tone and gameplay style that was consistent throughout the trilogy, you would always know what you were getting into when you picked up a Mass Effect game. EA would have likely found it easier to market Mass Effect to a wider audience because of that fact. Rather than split the marketing between different subsectors of the fanbase that came into the franchise from different entry points that greatly differed from each other. Always shuffling the cards in terms of gameplay, would likely also cause executives to lose confidence in the success of a new Dragon Age entry, because each time you're doing something new and experimental rather than build on top of a mold that reliably worked before.",2025-04-17 15:55:16,16,Arizona_Ranger_JPG,gaming

Hades and Dead Cells are my favorite. Hades you can think of the different weapons or different boon types as analogous to different champions/roles to master. In Dead Cells there are a lot more weapons and you can mix multiple types (melee+ranged or melee+shield, traps, etc.) in one run so it's more about mastering different broad play styles and learning the best approach for different enemies or routes. I 100%ed both games and it felt like a much less stressful/rage inducing way to satisfy a lot of the league-type cravings. They each have similar run lengths to League games as well and you can give up at any point if you think the run is no good, so pacing wise it has a similar cadence with built in breaks if you need to get up to stretch your legs, get a snack/drink, take care of a chore, etc. in between runs.",2025-04-16 20:55:04,2,suddenly_seymour,gaming

mnd3vwa,1jzrz77,reddit,"I think we've stalled massively on the tech side of things, maybe due to console ports, theres very few PC exclusives nowadays, the days of Crysis and the 1st Farcry are long gone.

The best graphically, out right now is Star Citizen, in parts. It can be quite bland at times, (it's set in space after all) but there are moments in the game where it's simply jaw dropping beautiful. 

Another good one that I've seen suggested is Ark Survival Ascended, providing you have the GPU, I don't! But I've seen it at 4k and oh my is it pretty!",2025-04-16 05:37:34,1,MrDonohue07,gaming

mofrvsi,1jzrz77,reddit,"We hit some kind of wall of diminishing returns with graphics several years ago. They seriously seem like they haven't made any real big advancement in forever.

The best graphics I can think of is Cyberpunk 2077 with max settings, path tracing, etc.. The most recent ""thing"" that makes graphics seem ""next-gen"" is ray tracing. At first, I didn't know what the big deal with it was, but actually playing games that make use of it, it's clear now. The main thing that looks so much better with ray tracing is reflections (and to a lesser extent, lighting). Anything that is supposed to cast reflections does so, and reflects much more accurately than rasterized reflections. It's cool in Cyberpunk for instance to be seated at a random food stall, look down at the dirty glass table, and see a reflection of the skyscraper behind me. Or see every little thing reflected accurately in a puddle on the street.

Of course, a lot of what makes graphics look better these days isn't necessarily the game itself but what you're playing it on. An OLED TV with HDR, 4k and support for at least 120 FPS and a powerful PC/system running it will make a lot of things look way better than a little 1080p TV from 10 years ago or an LCD monitor with a 60hz refresh rate with an outdated PC or console running the game.

All that said, I think a lot of the mind-blowing ""wow factor"" innovation is actually in VR, but VR hasn't really taken off with people (I personally think it's awesome but I have to be in the mood to play it which is rare these days).",2025-04-22 14:39:54,1,EggNeckSupreme,gaming

Other than that is it just a gaming club to have fun or if its a serious club trying to help kids go pro? Might want to read up the path of going pro and how to support the path by streamlining it. 

Workshops could help if you are able to get business experts like pros, managers, etc to hold speeches and information days.

Other than that you could host open tournaments in different esports titles and get some smaller sponsors for your school, etc.

Cyberpunk is a mere shadow of what it could have been if CDPR really knew what they were doing. They had all the budgets, great devs, a lot of lore ready for them yet they fail to tell a good story or take advantage of night city to make it a dynamic environment.

Cyberpunk is a beautiful game, with great art direction, some good story lines, a good expansion, yet the core game is a failure IMHO.

Cyberpunk is what happens when execs rely way too much on marketing hype to sell, they forget to make a great game first and foremost.

Nothing beats Heart Of Stone, from a story telling perspective.

I deem those who are content with CB ignorant, obviously it is not a bad game, but CDPR could have done so much better if they listened to their dev.

I would say the combat/moment-to-moment gameplay of both games is fairly lackluster but passable, and it's the narrative and world-building that sucks you in and adds stakes to the gameplay outcomes.

Console pros, easy of use, cheaper than a new pc. Console cons, only play games on the system, have to get the next console to keep playing current games

PC pros, Tons of games on different stores, Emulation of older systems giving even more games to play, upgradeable. PC cons, Expensive, tech issues, part compatibility games just not working because fuck you.",2025-04-07 11:57:12,1,EaterOfLemon,gaming

It also runs great and games look great on it, if you wanted to build a pc to match the performance of a ps5 it would cost you more than a ps5 would(unless you found some great 2nd hand parts) 

That being said, I'd personally go for a pc. I'm pretty invested though, I have a steam library with about 1000 games in it, I built my first desktop pc about 15 years ago and have upgraded so much that it has no original parts left. Pcs can be a pain though, more susceptible to viruses, sometimes stuff just doesn't work and you've got to spend time troubleshooting it.

Though I use to game on console before I switched to pc, the reason I switched was because consoles life expectancy is fairly short life expectancy considering its not easy to replace or upgrade components.

mlcp0dh,1jr8mb7,reddit,"Server-side checking and not sending information that's not required.

It's all you can do.

And it's usually already implemented, but same games are dumb and 20 years behind.

If you can't trust the data coming from the client, you have to process everything server-side and NOT supply the client with anything they don't need to display the game.

But that still leaves things like ""wallhacks"" and ""aimhacks"" because sometimes you have to send data on models that are JUST ABOUT to appear around corners to clients so they can draw them in time, and then clients can see data of anyone near a visible edge, even if they haven't walked around the corner yet.

And obviously an aimhack is just someone getting a player's position on screen and literally pointing the mouse at it, that's all it is.

You can implement limits on what you think a human is capable of, e.g. if someone aims unreasonably fast, but that just means that they sit under those limits and are still faster than the majority of players out there.

But if you can't control the client, you can only guarantee that what the server does is valid, and thus you end up in a position where the server's data can't filter down to the client.

Now you could do things like send the positions of a thousand models to every corner all the time, to pre-cache models for appearance, but at some point you still have to tell the client ""don't draw all these, only draw this one"" and at that point, wallhacks and aimhacks come back again.

It's why client-side detection is the only reasonable way in something like an FPS.  You can't trust ANY data from the client unless your software is there and can see everything that the client is doing (and even then you don't see EVERYTHING the client is doing... the anti-cheat could be inside a virtual machine and not know about it).  Even if you ask the client for a screenshot, it's just going to hide the cheat elements, take a screenshot, and send that, so you won't see the cheats.

There is no simple way around it, no amount of fancy tech can combat it, and nobody has yet come up with a way that can't be defeated.  If a computer can see the things that it needs to draw, and it can tell if they are an enemy or not, then it can point the crosshair at it and click fire.

This one I think will be a bit more common: Red Dead Redemption 2. It is a masterpiece in all ways except gameplay. It's kind of a petty thing, but I think what ultimately killed it for me was looting. I'm the kinda dude that wants to loot all the bodies and items when playing. Looting a body has about a 3-4 second animation attached. When you're in a big shootout with twenty enemies, that's a full minute of just looting animation. 

Looting items is even slower. Most games, you open a cabinet, you get a take all button, and you go on. In this one, you individually take out every single item in the cabinet and put it in your pocket. I'll maybe go back to it one day though.

Stealth was bare minimum mechanically, and the movement felt like a really cheap knock off of AC. Combat was polished and satisfying but the lack of depth and variety meant that it got stale pretty quickly.

Something about the aesthetic and vibe just doesn't work for me I hate that there is no straightforward storytelling. I hate the durability system. I hate the cooking and crafting, and overall hate a lot of the travel struggle. I really don't love the combat, I find too many enemies are just giant health bars. The game just never clicked for me and I played like 70 hours before giving it up. 

Its funny becuase I absolutely love Elden Ring which I feel shares a lot of tlsimilar DNA. However the combat just hits for me, and the exploration just feels so much more rewarding imo.",2025-04-02 11:38:41,1,ICDragon7,gaming

Skyrim is at best bland. Large world, but that is about as good as it gets. Cliche story, lazy faction quests, basic combat, and magic... when I want to play a game that involves no thinking, I will fart around Skyrim for a bit then play better games.

RDR2 has tedious writing. I had forgotten about Duke being known as a bad guy in the first game, so being beaten over the head with the fact that he cannot be trusted in the tutorial with his dialogue and actions was painful. And the fact that you have no choice but to obey him to drive the story forward was awkward. It is like knowing the twist in the first Bioshock before playing it. I gave up playing this game

Excepting the CD-i games which are notoriously bad, I can't think of a Zelda game that's no good. 


My personal favorites are the Oracle games and Majora's Mask. The Oracle games are great for how they interact with each other. Two separate stories that you can play concurrently and transfer items between and use to unlock new dungeons and locations. They even had GBA functionality where certain locations were only available if you played on GBA. Pretty cool stuff for the time even though  it could be seen as ""paywalling"" content.


And majora, to me, is just a refined Ocarina with darker undertones. I liked the 3 day cycle as the time management was a puzzle in and of itself. Reset to day 1 and try to fit as much of what you want to get done in, then try it again. I believe I 100%d it on original hardware.

1. (This answer is nostalgia talking, but it's also my opinion so who cares) Oracle of Ages/Oracle of Seasons (I know they are two different games, but they're tied for first). To be honest they were the first ones I played as I had heard about Zelda for a long time, but never ventured into the series. I then got both of those for free, and I loved them. Looking back now that I've played almost all of the games they are still really good. The gameplay is simpler while still being fun, and it doesn't have the harshness in difficulty that some of the older games have. Not that that's bad, but it just means it's more of a chill game.

2. Spirit Tracks. Zelda with trains actually had a good story, had one of the best (and unique) portrayals of Zelda, and was just an unexpectedly fun game for me. If you like the gimmicks of the game then it's great, and if you don't then this game will probably suck for you. 

3. Twilight Princess. I love me some gadgets. Unique items that have multiple uses are super fun for me. The story was intriguing, and it opened up new lore for the series. The best Ganondorf for me. If they had required the use of the sword techniques we acquired throughout the game to beat the final boss section that is a 1v1 sword fight than it would've been the best final boss fight in the series maybe even to this day. As it is really good, and I loved the artistic choices for the game. The game as a whole was held back by being a Wii game that focused on utilizing the unique hardware of the console. 

Honorable/necessary mention: Ocarina of Time is one of the best games ever. It's also integral to the narrative of the series. While the game is deserving of a spot in almost any top 3 list; I didn't include it because these other games have more personal weight to me.

mk7zxlw,1jlzh8m,reddit,"Link to the Past, OOT, and BOTW

Each represented taking all that makes a Zelda game amazing and brings it into a new generation of technology with a fresh vision of how it can be implemented 

*Link to the Past* brought a depth to the story and gameplay that hadn't really existed while remaining true to the top-down formula that worked in the original. It kept the secrets, the discoveries. First showing you a weird thing that you can't use and later giving you a tool/item that it works with. Each one of these weird things became a jumping off point for a whole new part of the game.

The sound leveled up, too. 8 bit doots and dits turned into a 16 bit symphony. The classic themes became epic and cinematic (for the time) and further immersed 10 year old me in the adventure.

*Ocarina of Time* was a similar leap. I remember feeling apprehensive when hearing that it was going to be a 3D adventure. Zelda was one of my first true loves of gaming, and to that date the only Zelda departures from the top down adventuring style were mediocre at best. However my concerns proved to be unfounded. Honestly, this is where Miyamoto and Tanabe prove to me that their vision of making a game was not about following a formula and getting the mix just right. It taught me that Zelda wasn't a success because of its elements, it was a success because of how it made me feel. And as long as they were reaching to recreate that feeling, the Zelda ""formula"" was less important. 

A 3D World allowed for exploration on a level that earlier hardware would not allow. I also think that they understood that advances in other games had raised the bar for what players would be expecting. You couldn't just create a map and some puzzles and cobble them together for a Zelda game. You had to give them something wholly new to explore. OOT did just that 

*Breath of the Wild* did this again. I've heard that when designing BotW, the directoral team wanted two things: 

* No place on the map should truly be inaccessible 
* When you get to a peak or the top of the tower or something that you are exploring, make the Vista beautiful.

These little rewards that were hidden everywhere further honored the Zelda ethos that what makes a Zelda game a Zelda game is the Wonder and the exploration. The secrets and the discoveries. When I played breath of the wild, I got to the end and found myself not wanting the game to end. After all the hours that I pumped into that game, it was the first time in a long time that made me feel like I was 10 again. A grown-ass man, finding the love in a game in a new way. 

I'd argue that tears of the Kingdom is more impressive on a technical standpoint and Titans up a lot of the quality of life issues people had with breath of the wild. But it wasn't quite the huge leap forward that BotW was.",2025-03-28 17:51:25,1,Bn_scarpia,gaming

mk83x0b,1jlzh8m,reddit,"Almost every Zelda game added some unique quirk to the game that made it slightly different than previous entries. My favorites were;

Minish Cap - the entire concept of shrinking to solve puzzles or get places made it feel like another dimension was added to the game. Paired with the entire ""Kinstone"" concept and art style, it made the game feel like a fresh game in the series rather than ""just another Zelda game""

A Link to the Past - probably the most complete feeling Zelda game i have ever played. A very straightforward game with so much more depth than you originally thing. The world feels alive and like just wandering around exploring is actually worth doing. The newer games (BOTW and TOTK) are more open world but feel dead and empty. Like most areas are just 1 or 2 enemies and some trees. But A Link to the Past made every screen count for something 

Oracle of seasons - I was young when I first played this. It was my first Zelda game after beating A Link to the Past. I was expecting more of the same but boy was I wrong. Solving puzzles and progressing the game by changing seasons was so original at the time. It made you stop and think. It also showed how much love the artists put into the game with how the world changed alongside the seasons. The story itself makes it worth a replay because there are some decisions you make that can impact events later.

mk83zzg,1jlzh8m,reddit,"Personally, I'd say:

The original NES Legend of Zelda - it's amazing how much they were able to do with so little. It doesn't hold your hand like later games, so there's an ever-present feeling of wonder and discovery as you stumble around the world, burning down trees and blowing up rocks to find secrets.

Link to the Past (SNES) - Not just the best game of the series, but arguably one of the best games of all time. The 16bit era had the pinnacle of pixel graphics which largely hold up today (while the blocky polygons and texture wraps of the N64 era feel extremely dated). The world is large and complex, dungeon design is peak, and there's a variety of interesting and useful items.

Oracle of Seasons/Ages (GBC) - the GameBoy games are my personal favorite entries in the series. There's a couple areas they fall shy of LttP: the graphical capabilities on the GameBoy(Color) are worse than the SNES so the screen is smaller and the sprites less detailed, and there's only two action buttons to the SNES's 6 so you're left swapping items around a lot more. But the addition of a Feather item to add jumps and the ability to equip another item over the sword make it feel dynamic anyways, and it improves in other areas. Many people love Link's Awakening, but fewer know about the Oracle games as they released later. I really enjoy their use of time/season manipulation to make overworlds more dynamic, and the interplay between the two games if you link them together is an amazing boon.",2025-03-28 18:11:04,1,wildfire393,gaming

Ocarina of Time is my #2. It does a great job of bringing the Legend of Zelda gameplay to 3D and has some great dungeon layouts.

\#3 is the original Legend of Zelda on the NES. It never holds your hand and really rewards exploration.

mk85jwv,1jlzh8m,reddit,"1: Majora's Mask 

2: Wind Waker

3: Ocarina of Time 

Majora's mask is a weird game with a darker, almost creepy vibe to it, and I love it. It's smaller than OoT, but the time-reset mechanics, and learning all the different stories through the world as you relive the same three days over and over again, each time learning more is so much fun, and very rewarding. I like weird games, and Majora's Mask is the weirdest Zelda.

Wind Waker is also unique but in a different way. It's got a bright and cartoony aesthetic, and a flooded world full of islands to be explored. I really enjoyed exploring in Wind Waker, it always felt satisfying, and the game is a relaxing one to play for me

Ocarina of Time is so often considered the Goat that I don't even know if I have to explain why I like it. It's THE Zelda game, it's quintessential. When you think of Zelda, you think of Ocarina of Time, the heart and soul of this series is embodied in this game.",2025-03-28 18:18:43,1,-Addendum-,gaming
mk86eua,1jlzh8m,reddit,"A Link To The Past, obviously.

My personal favorites after that are not really consistent with public opinion; I like when things get weird or unusual.

Majora’s Mask is probably my second favorite:  dark, strange, with time travel mechanics and bizarre story lines.

Breath Of The Wild/Tears Of The Kingdom feel like one big game, and they’re an incredible experience.  I couldn’t choose one without the other.  If I couldn’t choose the pair of them for my top 3, I might go with Windwaker.  Too “cute” for a lot of people, but the play control is excellent, the art is beautiful, and it’s just extremely charming the whole time.  Love that game.",2025-03-28 18:23:01,1,sleepyworm,gaming
mk86icr,1jlzh8m,reddit,"Twilight Princess is my number 1. It is the one Zelda game that feels like a true epic fantasy. An 800-1000 page book stopper of a game. Has a banger dungeon lineup and a truly epic final battle.

Ocarina of Time is the most magical of the Zelda games. Has this fairy tale atmosphere supported by a beautiful soundtrack. The atmosphere of the Shadow Temple is unmatched, and the Forest Temple is a top 5 dungeon in the whole series. I am the most nostalgic for this game too since it was my first.

Breath of the Wild. I found the story quite emotional and fascinating. Link reuniting with his friends who failed and died stopping Ganon the first time. Zelda's emotional journey as well, when listening to the JP voices, really breaks your heart as she struggles to protect the people and land she loves. Some good drama with her father the king that I wish could've been explored more. Dealing with characters and races whose societies are still trying to overcome the repercussions of that failure was also an experience. Seeing the new sages triumph and craft their own legends of bravery. Has my personal favorite art style. The best Zora design hands down. Baby Zoras are so fucking cute. I enjoy being allowed to explore to my heart's content in that game. People hate BotW because they think it jumped on the open world trend, but in reality Zelda is the OG open world game. Combat is actually the best and most diverse in the series. TotK is overhated, but it still doesn't reach the heights that BotW did.",2025-03-28 18:23:29,1,Key_Amazed,gaming

2. Breath of the Wild. New Zelda formula that worked tremendously well. There are just a handful of games where I can get lost for hours just exploring the map, not even doing any quests and these two games are absolutely on that list. Sure the breaking mechanic was annoying at first, but it forces you to get creative in combat which is actually amazing once you get used to that. Just don't get too attached to a certain weapon.

3. Twilight Princess. Absolutely loved TP when it first launched and I still play it every couple of years on an emulator. The darker and grittier vibe worked well and the weapons and world were amazing.

I know the newer games aren't that popular among older Zelda fans, which I kind of get because they deviate a bit from the ""Zelda formula"", but as a gaming experience they are clearly at the top for me.",2025-03-28 18:31:46,1,Stenktenk,gaming
mk88aox,1jlzh8m,reddit,"Haven't played too many, but of those I have played it would be:

-1 Link Between Worlds - my first Zelda was Link to the Past on GBA, so I loved revisiting that Hyrule. The wall-merging made for some great puzzles, I liked the freeform weapon acquisition and especially how everything had an upgraded form. And I liked how they tweaked the world a bit for the better - ice palace makes more sense for the mountains, put the turtles in the lake, give the seven sages a little more character, good stuff. Only drawbacks was Octorok baseball and it was too easy

-2 Majora's Mask - my first and only 3D Zelda. Always looked cool in youtube videos, really glad to see it come to 3DS where I could play it. What a weird cool game. The masks are a lot of fun, the sidequests were pretty great. I got stumped a few times as to how to progress. Sometimes the answer made me facepalm, sometimes I went ""how would I have figured that out?""

-3 Minish Cap - super charming little game, great pixel art, I like shrinking, Vaati's a cool villain.",2025-03-28 18:32:26,1,magmafanatic,gaming

mk88kfn,1jlzh8m,reddit,"I have a personal ranking of the entire series, and my current top 3 are Tears of the Kingdom, Ocarina of Time, and Link’s Awakening.

TOTK because I think it’s the most impressively programmed game ever made, and that the suite of tools they put into it breaks the wall between player and developer that few if any games have done before.

OoT because it’s such a trailblazer for what a 3D Action Adventure game can and should be, with innovations like z-targeting combat still be used as the basis for games like Dark Souls. Plus, it’s probably the most thematically rich story in the series that still hits like a brick at any age.

Link’s Awakening is a pretty personal pick, but I think it boils down what I love about Zelda to its essence. The quirky and inviting world, the colorful NPCs, the reward of exploration, and little things like the item trading sequence all capture what I consider the hallmarks of the series. It conveys a perfect vertical slice of all of the games in a perfect little package.",2025-03-28 18:33:46,1,oldinamerica,gaming
mk89wt1,1jlzh8m,reddit,"Have a seat my friend, and let me expound:

1) OoT - obvious #1, for it's uniquely perfect marriage of the light and dark sides of the Legend of Zelda series. It also offers the most memorable sound effects and music bits that manage to elicit all the nostalgia feels and also take you on a new, 3D adventure. While this may seem trivial now, it was revolutionary at the time. One of my favourite features in any video game are the Easter eggs and fun side quests. Like (SPOILER) floating around Kakariko village hanging from chickens! Classic. Or actually playing the Ocarina. Moreover there was the nove introduction of travellong through time that added a very different and neat element to the storyline.

2) TotK - this game is truly the masterpiece of the entire series imo. I list it second only because I was alive to know that OoT was a game changer in its own right and my favourite details from ToTk originated (or at least took root in my memory) in OoT. But TotK is incomparable. Massive open world with almost linearity so you can truly go anywhere and play the game however you want. This is a next level rpg and building on the improvements in BotW: Link can finally climb and jump! Omg how amazing was that feeling when you first realized you could climb a wall. The fighting is also a further step in progress that has been evolving with the series. I could go on, but I would never stop. I immersed myself in this game for a solid 6 months when it first came out and even my daughter's (7 and 9) were enamored.

3) This is tough. Had you asked a few months ago I would have put Twilight Princess without a doubt. I loved the overall eeriness and minor tones of every song and sound effect in that game. HOWEVER, I recently beat Echoes of Wisdom and my god what a fun twist on the classic top down game play. It is a new spin on player freedom. While the story is a bit more linear than the open world games, I absolutely love that almost every puzzle, every obstacle, every hill and every enemy can be conquered in whatever style you choose and adopt over time. And clouds ??? C'mon I know it's a bit of a cheat but sometimes it is worth suffering realism or difficulty for some pure fantastical fun. And of course the pinnacle of this game is that you finally get to play as Zelda and see her take centre stage! I loved it. My daughters loved it. 10/10 go get it now.

In closing, I do recognize that my evaluation of games has become biased by the mom & daughter gaming team experience (ie the more we all enjoy a game, the more I like it overall) but I don't care. I maintain that a game's inclusiveness and comraderie are in fact another point of praise.

But they want to it to appeal to as many people as they can, they want it to the be one that breaks it out to more people. How do they do this?

They try to make it a more casual experience, well when they do this it pulls the experience away from the actual extraction shooter player base. Look at all the failed ones, Cycle frontier, cod DMZ, Ubisoft’s canceled division extraction game. 

All of these tried to make it more appealing to pull in more people. Which made them lose any value in really why your looting anything, the pvp in them didn’t feel natural. Extracting with loot just turned it into money to really do fuck all with. It wasn’t used for anything. 

Extraction shooters like Tarkov, and hunt showdown succeed because they do exactly what they are made for. Tarkov is about the loot and customization, every single piece of loot in Tarkov has a use, for crafting, guns armor, hideout etc. 

Hunt showdown isn’t about loot or gear, it’s about bounties, but you still loose your hunter on death which accumulated specific perks the more you play with them and longer they survive. 

The economies can be fixed with just some sort of finance guy on the team to guide it in the right direction if they want to use a flea market type deal. 

Extraction shooters at their core is pvp, it’s niche, they aren’t going to pull everyone in.

Tarkov made a Pve mode for people that want to play it and as after like a 3 weeks the economy was already insanely inflated. Something that would cost like 60k on the PvP server was almost 1mil roubles on the Pve server. 

There’s so much less risk in playing the Pve server there’s more and more and more items extracted. People make even more money so the value of the roubles decreases and everything then costs millions of roubles.

The realism ends up taking parts of other less realistic games that streamline things and make them entertaining as a concept. With Bodycam it's a team v team tactical shooter, but you don't really get stats. When you get a kill nothing shows up on your screen to show that, which in an RPG or RP setting sounds amazing, but the entire game is based around being a tac shooter that is inherently competitive.

They cram a lot of really good looking assets, effects, filters, movement animation, photorealistic textures, all to make a REALLY good looking video...

Not for YOU, for developers. They make these things to show off their engine; How the lighting works, how textures react to lighting, how you can give a flat texture the illusion of a shadow, or the particle effects falling from the ceiling. They're all meant to show the impressiveness of the technology to that someone ELSE will buy the license to use that engine, and then make their own really cool photorealistic game.

The thing is... that's hard... And it's taxing on most people's  hardware. Most people are still on PS4 and 5 year old PCs. These engines are being made on the top PCs that aren't even available for customer use yet. And even if they buy the engine today, they're not going to have a game out for that engine for years. Game Engine is usually a 'first round' kinda thing you figure out.

Not to mention, photo realistic games are hard to make... Really; they're hard to finish. A cartoony pokemon jiggles weirdly and loads in the wrong texture, you might not think much of it. But if you're looking at a photorealistic face and the lips start animating at 400% top speed, you're going to notice. 

If ANYTHING doesn't react the way you expect in a game, the immersion is broken. Half Life Alyx was SO good because EVERYTHING reacted the way 'you expected'. You pick up a beer bottle and the liquid inside gravitates toward the bottom. You pick up a marker and write on a window cause you just CAN. You can search shelves by sweeping your arm across the shelf to move things away while being shot at enemies. If ANY of these things did not interact in the realistic  world it's presenting, the entire illusion is ruined. Sure ""Thats how game work, duh"" But imagine seeing a glass bottle in a shooter  game... You shoot it, you want it to explode into a flurry of glass and liquid... imagine seeing a black gunshot texture and the bottle doesn't move at all... That would ruin  the fun of bottle shooting!

But all those tiny realistic details take time to program, to test, to animate. So, when the PS6 and Switch'a'three come out, we'll probably start seeing more things like that.",2025-04-16 07:16:55,1,Too_Tall_64,gaming

My Time at Portia/Sandrock are open world action-RPGs. If there's Indie, A, AA, and AAA, these are probably A level games. Small studio with a fairly small budget, but too big to be indie IMO. Regardless, the games are pretty well polished all considered.

On the shooter side of thing, the Halo series is sort of a given if you haven't played it, but the Gears of War series is also definitely worth it.

There's also the gatcha games from Hyoverse which are generally pretty good.

GTA5: open world level design. But mostly linear narrative design. Spider-man also fits into this. 

Dishonored: Not open world, but its level design IS non-linear. The narrative is also semi-nonlinear, but not by much. 

Disco Elysium: I would say its open world - not the way GTA is in scale but in that the world is freely explorable. But the narrative is VERY non linear. 


I would very much consider Majoras Mask to be fairly open world. Not seamlessly, there are loading screens to move through, and you have a general path through the world. It doesnt reach BotW level open-ness, but it is not linear in the way that, say, Uncharted is. Uncharted is fully linear in narrative AND level design. 

So when you say a game is linear, the question you should ask is if you mean in regards to its level design, or its narrative design. Some games fit outside of these two terms, as well.

mmx0bxo,1jyawe9,reddit,"I think it's two different things. Open world describes the level of freedom of exploration a player has in the space and how much players are rewarded for going off the most obvious path. Some games are technically open world, but don't include any areas that aren't immediately tied to main story beats so there's no reason to ever stray or backtrack.

Linearity is a function of story beats, choice outcomes, and implicit replayability. How many different choices can be made to affect the world? Does each side quest give me many ways to complete it?

For instance, Far Cry is an open world game. The player is allowed to go anywhere at any time (mostly) and is rewarded for exploration. However, with the exception of a few additional endings that really don't involve that much player agency, the stories all end up mostly at the same place in the end. Most of them are fairly linear, in other words.

Many non-linear games are open world, but I don't think it is necessary. Linearity is more about how many different choices can be made to result in as many different outcomes as possible. The game could be mostly on rails as long as there are a lot of branching paths.

But I will argue that the way these maps are interconnected and the fact that the game is nonlinear to a degree makes the games FEEL more like an open world than some modern open world games.

I think the reason people disagree is because they understand the term ""Open World"" in different ways.

Some people use it as an adjective, others use it as a noun (sometimes even when using it as an adjective, they still understand it as a noun).

There are ways around this, have an hole you need to hook shot to get over? A well placed bomb and positioning can get you there early and you can access an area not meant to be accessed quite yet. 

Super Mario world is distinctly not an open world. You have an overworked map and individual levels. (You can use some sorcery to wrong warp but that’s another discussion).

I like to what thread to games for examples because of the simplicity and restrictions of game design at the time remove a lot of ambiguity.",2025-04-13 16:45:38,1,N/A,gaming
mmx6htv,1jyawe9,reddit,"Usually the best open world games are non-linear, but they don't strictly have to be. Assassin's Creed open world games love to level gate sections of the map, which does force more linear progression down to just one area so you can make sure your Number Goes Up. 

Compare that to Breath of the Wild, which is much more about non-linear open world gameplay. It has its own structure, sure, but it's very loose about how you choose to progress in it.",2025-04-13 16:52:05,1,Gornub,gaming
mmxh8o1,1jyawe9,reddit,"The most simplistic way I think of the most true open world games is absence of explicit loading sections. In Xenoblade X you can be in the hub city, get into your mech, fly out of the city, fly over the ocean, land in one of the other continents, no fade-in-fade-out loading necessary. But you DO load into a handful of discrete buildings within the city, so even it breaks it a little.

Majora's Mask is about as close to open world as we got with 3D games in 2000. But it's very much a series of connected small areas with very obvious boundaries, not very open at all compared to the last few Zeldas. Where I get a bit fuzzy on whether I'd consider something open world... the three numbered Xenoblade games. Their worlds are not entirely interconnected, but they consist of several VERY large open zones that do have direct connections to each other (well, 2 has separate floating continents so not so directly connected).

Non-linear is something else altogether. Super Mario World is non-linear. Go through the map in different ways, do levels out of order. But not even close to an open world game, despite the title.",2025-04-13 17:46:32,1,JoshuaJSlone,gaming
mmxrt8z,1jyawe9,reddit,"An open world means the world is open to explore yes? 

Valheim is defined as an open world survival craft. You can explore every part of the world mostly unrestricted. It's *open*. 

Some parts you won't survive in for long due to difficulty ramping up or some game mechanic making it near impossible without special gear.

However, the game has linear aspects as you can't unlock certain things until you defeat certain world bosses and get item s unlocked. But, you could skip all the first bosses and fight the last one if you managed to get yourself there and had the right items to initiate the boss trigger. So it's not necessarily hard locked linear. 

So the game has unrestricted access and is open. Non-open would mean areas are specifically locked away like maybe in a game with level based progression (see half life 2).

Closed/open, linear and non-linear will have synergies based on natural game mechanics. Why have a 100% linear game in a completely unrestricted open world? It would be frustrating to a lot of players to spend two days exploring and finding a new city only to have the AI say, ""You have to return to the first town you encountered and talk to D'dumb A.I. to begin your quest."" 

This shit isn't black and white either. Every game developer has an idea of how they want the game to work and not every game will have cut and dry explanations. 

Or.you could just ask ChatGPT. Claude, Gemini or other AIs to give a better cohesive breakdown on how these terms are defined. Gemini did a good breakdown of open world that's more eloquent than I can manage.",2025-04-13 18:41:25,1,oldfatdrunk,gaming
mmyuhmy,1jyawe9,reddit,"the problem I have is with the amount of ""buzzword marketing"" practices. People love throwing around a lot of terms that aren't really true and they just want to create more clicks.

I'd argue there are two ways to perceive this

you can look at it based on the narrative structure, or look at it based on the game world's accessibility.

For example, ToTK and BoTW are fully open world in both the actual map being completely open to you, and how you decide to take on quests in whatever areas you want.

you can also have totally open worlds, but have a linear narrative experience",2025-04-13 22:11:41,1,djr7,gaming

mmgtjwp,1jwa8wj,reddit,"Yes it's a great game.

It does some things much better than the original, however the overall story is a bit of a mess. There was a rewrite/cut in development and it's a bit obvious. Tenenbaum disappears from the story completely after the intro, and the villain/ending aren't even close to as good as 1.

In defense of Bioshock 2's story, I cared about Eleanor, while there was nothing to care about or connect to with your main character in 1. That's on purpose, your character is a 'blank slate' following programming in 1, in a meta commentary on how players engage with games. So 1 is a better story, but you aren't invested in the player character, by design.

Also the moral choices in 2 are better than 1. Bioshock 1s ""Murder little girls or don't"" is an example of stupid moral choices in games, where there's no actual nuance or thought in the decision. Bioshock 2 lets you come to your own judgement about whether deeply flawed people who are also still victims, deserve to live.

Bioshock 2 has much better level design and exploration. 1 is very linear simple and boxy when you go back to it. The AI and combat is 2 are WAY better. Again, go back and compare if you haven't played then in a while, because in 1 enemies would stand around shooting at walls and walking into traps.

Fighting the first Big Daddy in Bioshock is a cool fight and a big deal. But after that combat breaks pretty quickly and it's not hard or interesting. Bioshock 2 has a number of interesting boss fights, in addition to having you defend areas by setting up traps and making you use a bunch of resources strategically.",2025-04-10 22:19:10,9,Irish_Whiskey,gaming

Edit to add: the varied endings that are possible are a great touch too! That's it tho.


Things it does worse, in some cases much worse: character development, world building, environmental story telling, ambiance, plot, enemy design, music, tension building and general writing. 


Essentially, fun to play but everything that made the first truly *special* for me was either missing or severely lacking compared to the first.

mmh7by1,1jwa8wj,reddit,"Funny you say that- it's almost exactly the way I feel about the *first* Bioshock.  Now, it wasn't a direct sequel, but it WAS a spiritual one- to System Shock 2.

System Shock is one of those franchises that gets ignored by people born after its release, and it really, REALLY shouldn't be.  DOOM evolved into Painkiller and Serious Sam (and the recent DOOM games); Marathon evolved into Halo; Ultima Underworld fell into ruin (thanks, EA!); and System Shock...

SS 1 and 2 are very different games.  They're both excellent, but the first is an atmospheric action game (like DOOM probably would've been, if it hadn't been dumbed down), and the second is an FPS/RPG hybrid (like Deus Ex) with an even stronger atmosphere and more developed story, with strong survival horror vibes (in atmosphere; not so much in gameplay).  To give an example of what I mean: there's a point in the first game where you need to bypass a retinal scanner (we, um, apparently didn't quite understand how eyes worked back in the 90's; a lot of people thought those would work), but you don't have access to it, so you're likely to (since you probably don't know who DOES have access on your first playthrough) start collecting the severed human heads laying around and bring them to the scanner, trying them one by one and leaving *a pile of severed heads* lying on the deck next to the door.

Creepy?  Yes- but even at the time, the graphics weren't so tremendous that it'd turn your stomach, or the engine powerful enough to let you physically stack them.  In SS2, the cybernetic rig you've been implanted with sometimes picks up residual psychic emanations from the recently deceased- rather like visions of ghosts.  There's one you pick up where a woman is strapped down to a surgical table, begging someone else to not convert her into an alien-controlled cyborg puppet, while he hushes her and says ""soon you'll be the mother of them all"" as his equipment starts whirring- that it cuts out *before* he starts cutting into her is easily the most merciful moment in the game.

Do you see how that feels different?  Bioshock wasn't just (mostly) devoid of horror elements; it was far less visceral in how it showed them, and their subtler equivalents.  Rapture was a more interesting, and far better developed, setting than either Citadel Station OR the Von Braun, but the events of, and leading into, your involvement with the story... weren't.  And that's not taking into account the gameplay, which was HUGELY stripped down.

Bioshock 2 tried to walk between SS2 and Bioshock- the gameplay was more varied, at least, with the need for defensive gatherings and far better level design, and a *somewhat* different set of weapons (I for one had grown sick of the pistol-shotgun-chaingun-sniper-rocket launcher progression by the end of DOOM; I don't know what's taking the rest of you so long).  It ramped up the gameplay, and improved the moral aspect of the story- Bioshock's ""kill the little girls and get an early boost of ADAM or don't and ultimately get more"" had no nuance, and didn't even change the gameplay much, seemingly reliant on the players finding small children creepy- since every gamer I know is either a child or used to be one, it makes me wonder where the hell Ken Levine came from, but that's another issue- BS 2's questioning of whether you think people should be killed or spared when they've done enough to earn both is a more interesting question, and has at least a less cartoonish implementation.

Unfortunately, the story itself falls completely flat; just an anti-collectivist screed where the first was anti-individualist.  Weirdly, it was THAT aspect that Levine himself (who I don't think was strongly involved with BS 2) took for the awful mess that was Infinite.",2025-04-10 23:38:14,1,SidewaysGiraffe,gaming

There's a moral choice system but it happens organically so you don't have to overly stress over it.  Its an immersive Sim that lets you decide how you want to approach the game.  Between your Bethesda RPG enthusiasm and like of first person games I feel its a pretty strong chance you would like this one.

I will say the Borderlands series is one exception to this, once the DLC comes out I basically completely stop playing because of the way their leveling system works. DLCs in Borderlands historically also increase the level cap, which means all my gear I spent so much time grinding is useless in a level or two and I have to go back and grind it all again?

Stellaris has gone through many drastic changes through the years, it'll never be in a ""complete"" state from your point of view until stellaris 2 is out and they have abandoned stellaris. 

In games like stellaris you are better off playing and getting good at the game before more expansions are added because it's more and more systems and micromanagement and a lot of people find it too much to jump into.

Helps if the DLC is specifically meant to be endgame DLC, so I can just continue where I left off.

For something that you are meant to play a bunch though, no reason to wait.  Stellaris is a good example, yeah campaigns are pretty long for a strategy game, but one of the main points of Stellaris is the amount of customization you have for your factions and how you can play in different ways, so naturally I'd want to play a bunch anyway, and those DLC generally just add on new ways to play to support that.",2025-04-08 23:17:09,1,Kamakaziturtle,gaming

The main thing is input lag. TVs and wireless controllers have more input lag compared to their counterparts.

But I'm aware that in a lot of the implementations of archetypal gacha mechanics there are no safeguards against overspending on the part of the more exploitable subset of players.

Games in this category frequently dominate the top spots in Google Play’s revenue rankings.

While many players say they dislike gacha, more and more have come to accept it as a normal part of mobile gaming.

Pros

\- MUCH better quests across the board and more of them to stumble upon

\- Characters are more defined and less one note than Skyrim's

\- Spell crafting is pretty fun

\- Graphics are arguably better now due to the remaster

\- The remaster has some feedback to the combat now that puts it more in line with Skyrim

\- Leveling in the remaster is streamlined so now you don't have to worry about being efficient

\- Shivering Isles is the best thing Bethesda has made since Morrowind and Knights of the Nine is also excellent

\- Most of the cities and towns are pretty well designed and unique from one another, my favorite is Anvil  

  
Cons

\- Dungeons are not that interesting

\- The stretches between cities and towns are pretty samey throughout although the remaster helps a bit

\- If you level wrong you can actually become weaker as the game goes on (I don't know if this has been alleviated in the remaster yet)",2025-04-23 11:44:09,3,rondo_martin,gaming
mole9dn,1k5wgnq,reddit,"I picked my most important points here when it comes to RPGs -

World & Exploration - Believe it or not I felt a slight disappointment when I first played Skyrim when it came out because compared to Oblivion the World felt less lively to me. The density of places of Interest is higher in Skyrim, but imho Oblivion feels much more immersive. Maybe that is because you do not stumble across a bandit camp, cave etc. every few meters it feels more meaningful when you do. And the cities are much larger with many more NPC houses to sneak into at night. The overall tone of the land is much less bleak, more vibrant and lively whicht makes exploration a blast. It truly is the heartland of the empire with very different biomes and settlements to explore and all of the different races are more prevalent everywhere instead of 90% Nords.

Story & Quests - While the main story will not win any prizes, it is quite entertaining and very important for the overall TES lore. Sidequests and guild questlines are where the game really shines. Sure, there are a few tedious ones as in most RPGs but most of them rank between pretty darn good to absolutely amazing and at times hilarious. I really don\`t want to spoil anything here. Just roam across the land, talk to NPCs and you will find yourself in the strangest adventures sooner that later.

Since the game at its core is still the same oblivion with the engine from 2006 you have to deal with some jank and many dungeons can get quite repetitive and annoying, but overall there is absolutely no reason at all not to enjoy this gem if you loved Skyrim.",2025-04-23 11:59:42,3,feralalbatross,gaming

1. Feels alive to me, the atmosphere is more of a high fantasy area, forested.
2. The main story involves you charging through the gates of hell to bring the fight directly to the Daedra, a civil war looks quaint by comparison.
3. They've tweaked this to be a bit less annoying, so don't worry about it but I'd recommend maxing endurance out asap no matter your build for more hp.
4. It feels good, I've read it's improved but it's been so long it's hard for me to remember.  So far it's good is all I can say.
5. There's already a bunch of mods out, but none are must-haves for me.  This remaster brings the UI & graphics up to modern standards.  I'd recommend doing a vanilla playthrough first then you can mod away to your heart's content.

Personally it feels like it gives you more freedom in some areas such as spell crafting where you can make custom spells vs Skyrim where you had to buy pre-made spells.  This can lead to game breaking exploits if you want to cheese it.

2) Generally Oblivion is better here, especially with side quests.

3) Oblivions batshit crazy leveling system has been remade for Remastered, I haven't played enough to see how they compare but they're likely to be similar. You have to designate ahead of time which skills you'll level more quickly. There's also no perks but Skyrims perks in vanilla wasn't that big a deal.

4) Oblivions is a bit less interesting, no shouts, no dual wielding, magic in particular is less involved. There is spell crafting which sounds cool but really just allows certain broken interactions.

5) Far too early for Oblivion remastered modding to take off and on PS5 Bethesda have announced no mods.

Although it's also worth noting that they're developing Zero Company in partnership with Bit Reactor - a studio with more experience with turn based tactics games - and it's been referred to as Bit Rector's game moreso than Respawn's, so it's possible that Bit Reactor are taking the lead in terms of the gameplay and Respawn are there to oversee the Star Wars elements.

mny3ag7,1k2zc72,reddit,"I have played and enjoyed both. Both games lean casual, but I would say Last Epoch has the right amount of depth. D4 feels too casual at times.  One thing that others haven't mentioned, but how important is the story and main campaign to you? If this matters, then D4 actually has a lengthy and solid story, voice-acting, side quests, etc. Last Epoch's story is utter nonsense.

Apart from the campaign, LE is better in nearly all aspects otherwise. Way more room for experimentation without being overly complicated. Plus, LE has so many minion builds, which is an absolute dream for me. Pulling off builds and gear combinations just feels so much better in LE. While D4 has much better graphics, I actually prefer the more colorful and fantastical design of LE. A lot of D4 feels muted and samey.

The gameplay is solid. The skills and passive trees have depth and customization. It’s in a really good place for an ARPG that’s only been in full release for a little over a year. 

Path of Exile 2 is in early access, doesn’t have much engaging content once you beat the campaign. It looks amazing, but it’s punishing to experiment and more punishing to play off-meta builds. Sometime in the future this could be a REALLY good ARPG, but it’s going to take a lot of time.

mnr3z1l,1jzr6zm,reddit,"If Blue Prince has a problem, it’s not an RNG problem, but a feedback problem.

The game is so much less random and uncontrollable than you think, and the game does so much more to enable progress and discovery than you might suspect. It’s pretty much impossible to ever be genuinely stuck. It’s pretty much impossible to have a run in which you genuinely do not progress or discover. (Unless, of course, you have yet to understand the basics of how to build a good estate). You don’t even need to be very good at puzzle games to reach credits, it will happen almost automatically after a while.

However none of this is signposted or announced, and the game gives you few tools to recognize which of the things you’ve done are progress on which of the many dimensions of progress that exist.

The significance of what you’ve done often only becomes apparant a little while later. That, I believe, is the feedback loop that a lot of people really love, and a lot of people really don’t.

mn9o1v0,1jzr6zm,reddit,"You're definitely not alone in that assessment (believe me. It's the biggest criticism I've seen of blue prince) but as someone who just reached credits last night and has already logged 34 hours (mostly from passive note taking let's be honest) I'd like to try to sway your opinion on this.

Here's the main thing that people are getting hung up on. Blue Prince is 50% puzzle game, but also 50% roguelike deck builder. The developer, I've heard, has even said that he's a huge fan of Magic the gathering. So if you're 100% in the puzzle game camp you might get confused and frustrated with the rng mechanics you have to play around in order to accomplish anything in the game. But if you're 100% in the roguelike camp, you might completely miss a lot of the important puzzles and end up having to do a lot of legwork when the game takes you aside and says, ""by the way, you should have been writing this all down"". 

Now, so far everything I've said is very fair criticism of the game and I think it's totally fair to be intimidated by it. Here's why it works for me. For my first few hours with the game, I too was confused by the roguelike elements and spent a lot of time trying to find the ""puzzle"" in this puzzle game. But that, in addition to the game's lack of dedicated note taking system, pretty much forced me to take note of *everything* and be extremely critical of the game in the process. I was ready to hate the game and I wanted to build up a mountain of evidence as to why I should. But then around hour three, something clicked with me. Without getting into spoilers, I began to notice a pattern in my notes, and realized that I had been writing down the solutions to puzzles I would eventually be encountering in later rooms. This right here is the game's biggest strength. Every tiny out of place detail in the game's world, from the mansion interior, to its exterior, to the very aesthetic of its world *is* relevant to the puzzles. and it will be on the test. This makes it incredibly rewarding to players who have been paying attention. But the game is also smart about this too. Because it builds ""hint redundancies"" into its puzzles. If every detail is a key to a puzzle you'll find somewhere else, then there are some puzzles that will have multiple keys in different rooms to the same puzzle. What does this mean? Even if you miss the subtle hints, you can find more blatant hints and even solutions to the puzzles just by exploring the mansion. It's almost like a metroidvania in this sense. It almost makes me wonder if it's possible for a player to reach credits by exclusively engaging with the roguelike elements and ignoring the puzzles.

And on the topic of roguelike elements. This is the second element of the game that really clicked with me. Because you're not just playing a walking sim. You're playing a deck builder. and a pretty robust deck builder at that. Once I found myself not struggling with the rng mechanics but actively working on builds to *break* them, the game became significantly more rewarding. I have a friend who's also playing the game at the same time as me (we have a trade agreement on spoilers) and he found even crazier ways to exploit the game's systems and make out like a bandit in the process. Like seriously, if you enjoy roguelike deck builders. Try breaking this game's mechanics. Trust me it's incredibly rewarding.

And that doesn't even begin to cover the batshit insane lore this game has hiding underneath all of that. Let's just say I wouldn't be surprised to find out the dev is a sociologist.",2025-04-15 17:37:24,4,twinfyre,gaming

It's also made me look up. a couple of the solutions to the very lowest odds to spawn rooms because each run takes about an hour or more and a lot of things need to align to solve a lot of things.

HOWEVER, I wish the game did a better job of stressing that you can't really miss anything and that there's ways to reduce the randomness as you go on, I don't want to spoil anything but, a lot of the things you come across that seem super important, won't be important until way way way later, and by the time you get to that way later, deciding the layout of the house will be a lot, a lot easier.

In other words the game will never be mroe punishing than at the very start and theres mechanics to attenuate/get rid of essentially all the randomness.

I do wish there was a save and quit option though, playing it on ps5 so you can go to rest mode with it open but runs are really much too long later on to not get to save to do something else.

mmkm6lx,1jwq8nc,reddit,"I'd like to shoutout my favorite obscure 3DS strategy game, Code Name STEAM. You move your characters and shoot in real time on your turn, much like Valkyria Chronicles. Unlike Valkyria, though, you don't have any overhead map in STEAM. So high ground is vital not only for providing you angles of attack, but providing you a view of a good chunk of the map. The game also includes an XCOM-style overwatch attack that'll interrupt enemies who enter your sight on their turn.

Basically, high ground in STEAM is great for all the reasons it's great in shooter games for (and in real life, I'd imagine), but I think it's notable here since it's the kind of advantage other games tend to emulate, but done ""for real"" with 3d environments. In Advance Wars, for instance (the devs of which, Intelligent Systems, also made Code Name STEAM!), standing on a mountain tile gives you better vision range in fog of war maps.

Lots of weapons in STEAM also have arcing gravitational dropoff in their projectile paths, meaning high ground can extend the range of some weapons by a ridiculous degree.

But on the flip side, and this is something you WON'T see in strategy games that just emulate high ground - you're usually extremely vulnerable up high too. If you can see the enemy, they can see you, after all.

On the one hand, games are bigger & take larger teams longer to make. However, the AAA space has dedicated teams that specialize in one type of game, streamlining that process (max efficiency).

Monetization has been on the rise consistently (DLC-> smaller split DLC-> micro transaction-> true gambling loot boxes-> Now selling 1 game as multiple parts ex FF7 remake)

Also, an increasingly digital world makes scaling production infinitely cheaper. The ""fixed"" cost of physical media is gone, so every game they sell increases profit & decreases cost per unit.

The majority of staffing now is contract as well. When they ""fire"" 2000 people, they are just not renewing contracts. Terrible practice long term as the average experience level in the industry will plummet & games are going to suck for the next few years from the big studios.

Nintendo still gave us Metroid Prime Remastered at $40 around the same launch window, showing there's likely still going to be tiered pricing across first party games. What people don't want is $70-80 for a 20-hour Kirby or Yoshi game.

Game prices currently across the board are too low compared to the increased costs that everyone is facing. Does that mean all games should be $90? Of course not. You will also certainly get developers that charge high prices for games that aren't worth that at all.

mm0l806,1juaelo,reddit,"wdym ""complete""? you can't really complete this type of games unless we're talking about campaign which is usually very short and serves just as an introduction to much more deeper and larger gameplay loop. For some players something like PoE is an infinite game.

I'd say try MH: World. It's cheaper, currently it is better than MH: Wilds and has much more content. Also it has pretty solid, but not too long main campaign (DLC included) after completing which you might think you're done with this game and feel satisfied.",2025-04-08 11:18:39,4,whenyoudieisaybye,gaming

mm0q1u4,1juaelo,reddit,"Time is arbitrary, what is a lot to someone might not be a lot to someone else. This has been the long time problem of games like Diablo. Do you configure the drop rates around that of the no-lifer or the casual weekend dad. There is no one answer.

What is more measurable however is satisfaction and completeness after you get done with a game, be it for 15 hours or 150 hours.

One game that did this very very well was Hollow Knight simply because the player could decide where to stop. One ending? All endings? Boss ladder? Steel soul? The developers knew how to deliver satisfaction and a sense of “I’ve done it” for a wide range of gamers, versus something like Diablo which is an endless rabbit chase and you stop when you get bored of the repetition.

I have ~50 hours on Hollow Knight and maybe ~200 hours in Diablo 4. Yet I will whole heartedly recommend HK but not D4 regardless of the time spent. One feels complete and satisfying, one feels like empty checkboxes without a satisfying end",2025-04-08 11:55:08,1,WilsonKh,gaming

You then ""grind"" or replay it with different classes at your leisure, whatever you fancy doing, but the games are ""done"".

mm3rsp6,1juaelo,reddit,"Outside of a game being super short for it's price tag (Like I wouldn't be happy with a 5 hour game for a 60$ price tag) I don't really care how long it takes to complete.  What matters is how long it's able to be fun.  I don't play games just to complete them, I play them to enjoy them.  If I get 3-4 months of enjoyment from that game then it was a great purchase.  And even if I get bored a month in and won't complete it, I'd still be happy with getting a full month of enjoyment.

You'll need to be more specific on what you consider ""complete"".  All of the games you listed you can finish the main game.  But you are talking about live service games, if you are wanting the game to be done... your kinda barking up the wrong tree.  The point of a live service game is for them to get continued support and updates over time.  The only one on that list thats ""complete"" in the sense that it's no longer getting new seasons/updates is Monster Hunter World (since Wilds is the new current one) and the original Diablo 2 (not the remake)",2025-04-08 21:17:23,1,Kamakaziturtle,gaming
