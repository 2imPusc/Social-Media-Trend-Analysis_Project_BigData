programming,1jqc8gy,New Python lock file format will specify dependencies - Your thoughts?,"Python’s builders have accepted a proposal to create a universal lock file format for Python projects that would specify dependencies, enabling installation reproducibility in a Python environment.

Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) 751, accepted March 31, aims to create a new file format for specifying dependencies that is machine-generated and human-readable. Installers consuming the file should be able to calculate what to install without needing dependency resolution at install-time, according to the proposal.

Currently no standard exists to create an immutable record, such as a lock file, that specifies what direct and indirect dependencies should be installed into a Python virtual environment, the proposal states. There have been at least five well-known solutions to the problem in the community, including PDM, pip freeze, pip-tools, Poetry, and uv, but these tools vary in what locking scenarios are supported. ”By not having compatibility and interoperability it fractures tooling around lock files where both users and tools have to choose what lock file format to use upfront, making it costly to use/switch to other formats,” the proposal says.

Human readability of the file format enables contents of the file to be audited, to make sure no undesired dependencies are included in the lock file. The file format also is designed to not require a resolver at install time. This simplifies reasoning about what would be installed when consuming a lock file. It should also lead to faster installs, which are much more frequent than creating a lock file.

The format has not yet been associated with a specific release of Python, but is guidance for tooling going forward. Actual adoption remains open-ended. Acceptance of the format is full and final, not provisional. The universal format has been the subject of an estimated four years of discussion and design.",201,0.89,86,2025-04-03 07:32:53,https://www.infoworld.com/article/3951038/new-python-lock-file-format-will-specify-dependencies.html,Choobeen

They propose a European concept of memory safety. They introduce
categories of memory safety and the categories are summarized in the
memory-safety levels 1 to 5. Language features are categorized regarding
their support of memory safety.

They introduced the terms wild-pointer (which is essentially a C pointer)
and checked-pointer. Inside the category of checked-pointers they further
distinguish between ones which can be NULL and ones that cannot be NULL.
So Java references count as checked-pointers which can be NULL.
Interesting fact: Although C++ references cannot be NULL they count as
wild-pointers, because there are ways to cast a C++ pointer to a reference.

Regarding unsafe-parts and inline-assembly they state that they are
overused which compromises safety. They made a study about languages
with unsafe-parts and inline-assembly. The study found out: About 30% of
all Rust crates incorporate some use of unsafe Rust. The study also states:
70% of Rust developers are calling unsafe code through foreign functions.

In their language evaluation the language Seed7 is the clear winner.
It is the clear winner because it is memory safe and has no unsafe parts.
As a consequence the European Commission proposes the use of Seed7
in many areas of software development. There will be a Europe-wide
research fund to facilitate the use of Seed7 in more areas. Companies will
have tax reductions if they rewrite programs or libraries in Seed7.

This is seen as long term commitment of the European Union to improve
software quality and to make Europe independent in the software industry.

It's basically a few of the best I have found merged together and rewritten in big parts. I have also added a _super short summary_ and a _code example_. Maybe it helps one of you :-)

# OAuth Explained

## The Basic Idea

Let’s say LinkedIn wants to let users import their Google contacts.

One obvious (but terrible) option would be to just ask users to enter their Gmail email and password directly into LinkedIn. But giving away your actual login credentials to another app is a huge security risk.

OAuth was designed to solve exactly this kind of problem.

Note: So OAuth solves an authorization problem! Not an authentication problem. See [here][ref1] for the difference.

## Super Short Summary

- User clicks “Import Google Contacts” on LinkedIn
- LinkedIn redirects user to Google’s OAuth consent page
- User logs in and approves access
- Google redirects back to LinkedIn with a one-time code
- LinkedIn uses that code to get an access token from Google
- LinkedIn uses the access token to call Google’s API and fetch contacts

## More Detailed Summary

Suppose LinkedIn wants to import a user’s contacts from their Google account.

1. LinkedIn sets up a Google API account and receives a client_id and a client_secret
   - So Google knows this client id is LinkedIn
2. A user visits LinkedIn and clicks ""Import Google Contacts""
3. LinkedIn redirects the user to Google’s authorization endpoint:
   https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?client_id=12345&redirect_uri=https://linkedin.com/oauth/callback&scope=contacts

- client_id is the before mentioned client id, so Google knows it's LinkedIn
- redirect_uri is very important. It's used in step 6
- in scope LinkedIn tells Google how much it wants to have access to, in this case the contacts of the user

4. The user will have to log in at Google
5. Google displays a consent screen: ""LinkedIn wants to access your Google contacts. Allow?"" The user clicks ""Allow""
6. Google generates a one-time authorization code and redirects to the URI we specified: redirect_uri. **It appends the one-time code as a URL parameter**.
   - So the URL could be https://linkedin.com/oauth/callback?code=one_time_code_xyz
7. Now, LinkedIn makes a server-to-server request (not a redirect) to Google’s token endpoint and receive an access token (and ideally a refresh token)
8. **Finished**. Now LinkedIn can use this access token to access the user’s Google contacts via Google’s API

---

**Question:**
_Why not just send the access token in step 6?_

**Answer:** To make sure that the requester is actually LinkedIn. So far, all requests to Google have come from the user’s browser, with only the client_id identifying LinkedIn. Since the client_id isn’t secret and could be guessed by an attacker, Google can’t know for sure that it's actually LinkedIn behind this. In the next step, LinkedIn proves its identity by including the client_secret in a server-to-server request.

## Security Note: Encryption

OAuth 2.0 does **not** handle encryption itself. It relies on HTTPS (SSL/TLS) to secure sensitive data like the client_secret and access tokens during transmission.

## Security Addendum: The state Parameter

The state parameter is critical to prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. It’s a unique, random value generated by the third-party app (e.g., LinkedIn) and included in the authorization request. Google returns it unchanged in the callback. LinkedIn verifies the state matches the original to ensure the request came from the user, not an attacker.

## OAuth 1.0 vs OAuth 2.0 Addendum:

OAuth 1.0 required clients to cryptographically sign every request, which was more secure but also much more complicated. OAuth 2.0 made things simpler by relying on HTTPS to protect data in transit, and using bearer tokens instead of signed requests.

## Code Example: OAuth 2.0 Login Implementation

Below is a standalone Node.js example using Express to handle OAuth 2.0 login with Google, storing user data in a SQLite database.

```javascript
const express = require(""express"");
const axios = require(""axios"");
const sqlite3 = require(""sqlite3"").verbose();
const crypto = require(""crypto"");
const jwt = require(""jsonwebtoken"");
const jwksClient = require(""jwks-rsa"");

const app = express();
const db = new sqlite3.Database("":memory:"");

// Initialize database
db.serialize(() => {
  db.run(
    ""CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, name TEXT, email TEXT)""
  );
  db.run(
    ""CREATE TABLE federated_credentials (user_id INTEGER, provider TEXT, subject TEXT, PRIMARY KEY (provider, subject))""
  );
});

// Configuration
const CLIENT_ID = process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID;
const CLIENT_SECRET = process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET;
const REDIRECT_URI = ""https://example.com/oauth2/callback"";
const SCOPE = ""openid profile email"";

// JWKS client to fetch Google's public keys
const jwks = jwksClient({
  jwksUri: ""https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs"",
});

// Function to verify JWT
async function verifyIdToken(idToken) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    jwt.verify(
      idToken,
      (header, callback) => {
        jwks.getSigningKey(header.kid, (err, key) => {
          callback(null, key.getPublicKey());
        });
      },

[The Prompt-to-Program Paradox](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shubhams2m_over-the-past-few-days-while-working-with-activity-7316492668895666177-QXjp?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABuBmdQBwFtudcUzj63jfxVRra0jqdc4KpQ), referenced on LinkedIn, explains why: LLMs accept casual, human instructions just fine. Compilers, though, are strict — one semicolon error, and it’s dead. That gap makes AI struggle with tough coding tasks.

Funny thing: AI was supposed to replace us, but we’re still fixing its wrong code. Now folks are coming up with “rules” for writing better prompts — so exact they’re like code to get code.

**Turns out, the better you prompt, the more of a programmer you already are.**",148,0.74,66,2025-04-13 09:20:19,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shubhams2m_over-the-past-few-days-while-working-with-activity-7316492668895666177-QXjp,OpinionQuiet5374

It shows only the branches and commits that are active in your workflow, so you’re not buried in noise. Uncommitted changes appear just like `git status`, and y**ou can run Git actions like committing, rebasing, resolving conflicts, and managing branches — all from the UI.**

When paired with [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/), it also shows PR status, CI results, and comment counts inline.

It’s inspired by Meta’s Smartlog (from the Sapling source control system), but adapted for Git.

Would love feedback if you try it out.",113,0.9,26,2025-04-12 23:57:00,https://www.interactive-git-log.com/,dashmn210

In this post, I’ll shed some light on what SpecTec is, what it helps with, and why it takes Wasm to a new level of rigor and assurance that is unprecedented when it comes to language standards.

One feature that sets Wasm apart from other mainstream programming technologies is that it comes with a complete formalization: [...]

This was a huge leap forward, because the practical state of language specifications is basically stuck in the 1960s: most language standards, even new ones, are still defined by some basic grammar notation for their syntax (and sometimes not even that), while their semantics is given by a combination of pretty prose, hidden assumptions, and wishful thinking.",68,0.87,15,2025-03-28 11:35:12,https://webassembly.org/news/2025-03-27-spectec/,sideEffffECt

I've received positive feedback which I am very happy with.

I wanted to share why I chose for Calendar Versioning instead of the more traditional SemVer.

Let me know what you think and if this is the best way for managing versions!

programming,1jmzkug,Git as a binary distribution system: dotbins for portable developer tools,"I'm sharing a different approach to managing developer tools across systems:

**Problem:** Every OS has different packages and versions. Moving between systems means constant tool reinstallation.

**Solution:** dotbins - Download binaries once, version control them, clone anywhere

The workflow:
1. Define your tools in a YAML file
2. Run `dotbins sync` to download binaries for all platforms
3. Store everything in a Git repo (with optional LFS)
4. Clone that repo on any new system

Create a `~/.dotbins.yaml` file with contents:

```yaml
platforms:
  linux:
    - amd64
    - arm64
  macos:
    - arm64

tools:
  # Standard tools
  bat: sharkdp/bat
  fzf: junegunn/fzf
  
  # With shell integration
  bat:
    repo: sharkdp/bat
    shell_code: |
      alias cat=""bat --plain --paging=never""
      alias less=""bat --paging=always""
  
  ripgrep:
    repo: BurntSushi/ripgrep
    binary_name: rg
```

After running `dotbins sync`, you'll have binaries for all platforms/architectures in your `~/.dotbins` directory.

```bash
# On your main machine
cd ~/.dotbins
git init && git lfs install  # LFS recommended for binaries
git lfs track ""*/bin/*""
git add . && git commit -m ""Initial commit""
git push to your repo

# On any new system
git clone https://github.com/username/.dotbins ~/.dotbins
source ~/.dotbins/shell/bash.sh  # Or zsh/fish/etc.
```

This approach has been a game-changer for me. I clone my dotfiles repo and my `.dotbins` repo, and I'm instantly productive on any system.

- Project: https://github.com/basnijholt/dotbins

programming,1jl8zxk,Let's Parse and Search through the JFK Files,"All -

Wanted to share a fun exercise I did with the newly released JFK files.

The idea: could I quickly fetch all 2000 PDFs, parse them, and build an indexed, searchable DB? Surprisingly, there aren't many plug-and-play solutions for this (and I think there's a product opportunity here: drag and drop files to get a searchable DB). Since I couldn’t find what I wanted, I threw together a quick Colab to do the job. I aimed for speed and simplicity, making a few shortcut decisions I wouldn’t recommend for production. The biggest one? Using Pinecone.

Pinecone is great, but I’m a relational DB guy (and PG\_VECTOR works great), and I think vector DB vendors oversold the RAG promise. I also don’t like their restrictive free tier; you hit rate limits quickly. That said, they make it dead simple to insert records and get something running.

Here’s what the Colab does:

\-> Scrapes the JFK assassination archive page for all PDF links.

\-> Fetches all 2000+ PDFs from those links.

\-> Parses them using Mistral OCR.

\-> Indexes them in Pinecone.

I’ve used Mistral OCR before in a previous project called Auntie PDF: [https://www.auntiepdf.com](https://www.auntiepdf.com/)

It’s a solid API for parsing PDFs. It gives you a JSON object you can use to reconstruct the parsed information into Markdown (with images if you want) and text.

Next, we take the text files, chunk them, and index them in Pinecone. For chunking, there are various strategies like context-aware chunking, but I kept it simple and just naively chopped the docs into 512-character chunks.

There are two main ways to search: lexical or semantic. Lexical is closer to keyword matching (e.g., ""Oswald"" or ""shooter""). Semantic tries to pull results based on meaning. For this exercise, I used lexical search because users will likely hunt for specific terms in the files. Hybrid search (mixing both) works best in production, but keyword matching made sense here.

Great, now we have a searchable DB up and running. Time to put some lipstick on this pig! I created a simple UI that hooks up to the Pinecone DB and lets users search through all the text chunks. You can now uncover hidden truths and overlooked details in this case that everyone else missed! 🕵‍♂️

Hey all, r/programming!

I wanted to share with you my hobby project that I've been developing in my spare time: **AbyssIRC**, a modern IRC server written in C#.

# 📢 IRC is not dead, long live IRC!

Despite Discord, Slack, and all the other modern communication platforms, IRC continues to be used by many communities. It's simple, lightweight, and it works. AbyssIRC aims to bring new life to this historic protocol with a modern and scalable implementation.

# 🧠 A project to learn

I started this project mainly as a learning experiment. It has allowed me to explore:

* Scalable and event-oriented architecture
* Reactive systems with observer pattern
* Modular and extensible design
* Efficient network connection handling
* Standard protocol implementation

# 👋 Goodbye legacy code

It's time to say goodbye to IRC servers from the 90s! AbyssIRC is built with modern technologies and contemporary development practices. It's not just another fork of a historical project, but a completely new implementation.

# 🚀 Features and design

* **Scalable**: Designed to be distributed and handle a large number of connections
* **Reactive**: Uses event-driven patterns for internal communication
* **Extensible**: Integrated [Jint](https://github.com/sebastienros/jint) scripting engine for JavaScript plugins and extensions
* **Configurable**: Advanced configuration management via YAML
* **Testable**: Architecture that facilitates unit and integration testing

# 🔌 Jint scripting engine

One of the features I'm most proud of is the integration of the Jint JavaScript engine, which allows you to:

* Create plugins and extensions without recompiling the server
* Add custom commands
* Implement custom moderation logic
* React to server events with custom scripts

# 🛠️ Future developments

I plan to make AbyssIRC fully Kubernetes-ready, allowing for a distributed and highly available implementation.

# 🤝 Looking for contributors!

I'm looking for developers interested in contributing to the project. Whether you're a C# expert, an IRC enthusiast, or just curious, any contribution is welcome! Here are some ways you can help:

* Implementation of advanced IRC features (services, bouncers)
* Creation of plugins with Jint
* Documentation improvements
* Testing and bug fixing
* Implementation of CI/CD and k8s deployment

# ❓ What do you think?

I'd be happy to receive feedback, suggestions, or simply discuss with other IRC enthusiasts or C# developers. Are you interested in a project like this? Do you have similar experiences to share?

*PS: If you're still convinced that IRC is dead, come take a look... maybe you'll change your mind!* 😉

*PPS: I'm fully aware that the code still has a long way to go and there will certainly be imperfections. I'm open to constructive criticism - you know, the kind that comes with concrete suggestions! If you see something that could be improved, instead of a simple ""this sucks"", I'd prefer a ""have you considered using X instead of Y because..."". We're all learning, right?*",26,0.81,0,2025-03-28 14:27:15,https://github.com/tgiachi/abyssirc-server,squidleon
