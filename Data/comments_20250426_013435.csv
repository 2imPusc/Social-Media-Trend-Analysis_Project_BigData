mk0xq8o,1jksudo,reddit,"The title of this is incendiary and I take several issues with it. I am a geneticist working at the intersection of somatic mutation and epigenetic patterns. This paper (an essay which is not research or a formal review) is not particularly revelatory — we’ve known for a while that somatic mutations alone do not explain every facet of cancer. But to that end, we also know it does explain a lot.

Many (if not all) cancers, have genetic subsets and genetic causes that can be directly targeted. Having a cancer with a specific mutation can open the doors to more effective treatments and even full cures. Good examples of this are fusion proteins, a clear somatic mutation that we know drives cancers. We have made such incredible progress with cancer genetics based on somatic mutation theory.

To that end, we have also known for at least 50+ years that cancers take several mutations to be pathogenic, metastatic, and evasive. Biology has lots of checks and balances to make sure the house doesn’t collapse at the first mutation. This is why carriers of BRCA mutations are not riddled with cancer all the time. 

We also know with great detail the role of specific epigenetic patterns in cancer. Methylation is the most relevant clinically but we also know chromatin conformation, histone modification, and selfish genetic elements play a role in cancer. Sometimes these interact with inherited genetics (eg QTLs for methylation) which creates high order complexity when you also throw in somatic mutations. 

So, is the somatic mutation theory dead? Well it clearly works and produces incredible scientific progress. But literally every geneticist knows mutations are not the sole player in shaping cancer etiology. So who is this for?",2025-03-27 15:25:47,3,Mitochondria95,science

new-looking glass that puts one’s way of seeing the world on steroids.”

Is this some sort of joke article? What a bizarre way to open a scientific article

Edit:

I actually read the article, and I found it interesting and compelling. I also find it true that in modern science and academic environments, disruptive ideas are often suppressed. Although I’m not an expert to know how disruptive or revolutionary this authors ideas really are. I also wish the author had speculated about how the he authors ideas about what could be driving cancer could lead to new and exciting novel treatments.

I asked ChatGPT to summarize the article, and honestly I found the summary much more easy to understand. The way the article was written is a bit grating, although it’s probably worth reading if you are interested and want to dive deeper.

ChatGPT summary of the article below:

The article “The end of the genetic paradigm of cancer” by Huang, Soto, and Sonnenschein (2025, PLOS Biology) challenges the longstanding belief that cancer is fundamentally a genetic disease caused by somatic mutations. Here’s a summary of its key points:

Main Argument:

The authors argue that the somatic mutation theory (SMT)—the idea that cancer arises from genetic mutations that provide a selective growth advantage—fails to explain many findings from recent cancer genomics and single-cell transcriptomics. Instead, they propose that non-genetic factors, cell plasticity, and tissue context play a central role in cancer development.

Key Findings Challenging the Genetic Paradigm:

	1.	Some cancers have no consistent driver mutations, and conversely, so-called oncogenic mutations are found in normal, healthy tissues.

	2.	Clonal evolution doesn’t follow Darwinian logic: Many tumors contain multiple clones with no single “fittest” clone dominating.

	3.	Tumor cells can normalize (revert to non-cancerous behavior) when placed in a healthy embryonic environment.

	4.	Non-genetic cell state changes and gene regulatory network dynamics explain many cancer behaviors better than mutation-based models.

	5.	Stress-induced phenotype changes, like treatment resistance, often arise from reversible, non-genetic mechanisms rather than selection for resistant mutants.

Proposed Alternative Frameworks:

	•	Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs): Cell phenotype arises from complex interactions among genes, forming stable “attractor” states. Cancer may occur when a cell slips into one of these latent attractor states—cancer attractors—not normally accessed in development.

	•	Tissue Organization Field Theory (TOFT): Suggests that cancer is a disease of tissue architecture and cell-to-cell communication, not just individual cell mutations.

Evolutionary Perspective:

The article also critiques the oversimplified application of Neo-Darwinian evolution to cancer, highlighting concepts like phenotypic plasticity, group selection, and niche construction as more fitting frameworks to understand tumor progression.

Conclusion:

The authors advocate for a shift in cancer research—moving beyond the gene-centric view to one that emphasizes systems biology, cell states, tissue context, and developmental biology. They don’t reject the role of mutations altogether but argue that mutations alone cannot explain the complexity and behavior of cancer.

mm6gq3f,1jv0sxk,reddit,"Asthma affects more than 6% of U.S. children, making it the most common chronic disease in kids nationwide. It’s difficult to isolate any single cause, but one of the most common contributors is air pollution: Studies have shown that breathing air with high levels of fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide and other environmental pollutants can increase children’s risk of developing asthma. But it’s been unclear whether long-term, early childhood exposure to ozone, the pollutant that most frequently exceeds U.S. air quality standards, contributes to the disease.  

Logan Dearborn, a doctoral student at the University of Washington, set out to find a possible link. In a study published April 2 in JAMA Network Open, Dearborn and collaborators identified a puzzling trend: Children exposed to higher levels of ozone in their first two years of life were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with asthma or wheezing at ages 4-6 — but researchers didn’t observe the increased risk of asthma at ages 8-9.

mou34v3,1k6zrum,reddit,"> Published in JAMA Network Open, the study reveals promising progress toward predicting how patients with major depressive disorder will respond to antidepressant medications using brain imaging and clinical data. The research demonstrated that brain connectivity patterns – specifically in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex – could significantly improve predictions of treatment response across two large, independent clinical trials.

>Using machine learning models trained on clinical and neuroimaging data from more than 350 participants in two international trials – EMBARC in the U.S. and CANBIND-1 in Canada – the researchers evaluated whether their algorithms could reliably predict who would respond to common antidepressants like sertraline and escitalopram. They found that adding a brain connectivity marker to traditional clinical data (such as age, sex and baseline depression severity) significantly improved prediction performance across both studies.
>
>“We identified a brain connectivity marker that was predictive of response to common antidepressants across two large-scale clinical trials in the U.S. and Canada,” said Peter Zhukovsky, a former postdoctoral fellow in Pizzagalli’s laboratory and now scientist in the Brain Health Imaging Centre at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health and first author of the study. “The predictive performance of our algorithm was improved by the addition of the brain connectivity feature to clinical and demographic markers, reaching moderate levels. Our findings are promising for the search for biomarkers predicting depression response. We hope these efforts will help connect patients with treatments that are most likely to work for them.”

It is unusual to think that the foods we grow or consume would have substantial effects on who we are as people; but we so closely associated the Irish with potatoes, despite the fact that in the 13th century, no Irishman would have any idea of what a potato is.

As a brief aside, what were people eating before they found potatoes in the Americas? I frequently joke they were eating each other, but it seems unusual how many new-world foods rapidly became ingrained in our cultures. Though, perhaps it isn't so unusual, as we imported spices from the east and engrained them quite readily into our cuisine.

Evo-psych is a widely derided field for offering strange explanations for effects seen, but offering very little in the way of experimental controls, mostly as taking an Asian child from their parents, forcing it to live in a society you've constructed in which rice simply does not exist is not an ethical experiment, or so the board told me when I first proposed it.",2025-03-27 17:41:30,38,Dzugavili,science

mnd5hwm,1k0d8vk,reddit,"**Fast and selective ion transport in ultrahigh-charge-density membranes**

Abstract

Ion-selective membranes are central to electrochemical technologies due to their ability to regulate ion transport and differentiate between cations and anions. However, a major obstacle to their effective implementation is the inherent trade-off between ionic conductivity and cation/anion selectivity, a consequence of the interdependence between membrane charge and water content. Here we introduce a membrane design strategy that not only achieves high charge densities but also nearly decouples charge from water content. Our strategy involves the copolymerization of low-molecular-weight charged monomers and charged cross-linkers, ensuring that every repeat unit of the polymer backbone contains a charged group. Anion-exchange membranes synthesized using this strategy exhibit ultrahigh charge densities, substantially advancing the conductivity/selectivity upper bound. We further demonstrate the practical implications of these ultrahigh-charge-density membranes for electrodialytic brine concentration, achieving a lower specific energy consumption than the state-of-the-art benchmark. This advancement in membrane design can impact the development and deployment of electrochemical systems across a spectrum of energy and environmental applications.

mjvk5q1,1jkisoq,reddit,"> Although certain brain areas are known to respond to numerical quantity, this study expands that understanding by showing that some regions respond to relative quantity (e.g., “extra-small,” “small,” “large,” and “extra-large”) rather than absolute quantity (i.e., specific quantity). Moreover, these context-dependent, relative representations become more pronounced along the pathway from the parietal to the frontal lobe.
These results highlight the flexible nature of numerical quantity processing in the brain, and they are expected to advance our understanding of how the brain handles other types of “magnitude” concepts, including time and size.

> Furthermore, our study revealed a hierarchical structure in visual processing: lower sensory regions represented numbers in absolute terms, whereas higher-order cortices, from the parietal to the frontal lobe, gradually shifted toward relative numerical quantity representations.

* Approximately 1.25 million people in the UK have an eating disorder 
* 12.5% of 17 to 19-year-olds in England reported having an eating disorder in 2023, compared with 0.8% in 2017 
* The financial cost of eating disorders to the English economy was estimated as £8 billion in 2020 

The paper states that, in addition to increasing numbers, the lack of national guidance, ad hoc data collection, and inconsistencies in both quality of care and evaluation of service provision are leading to disparities in support provided to people with eating disorders across England. This has led to calls from activists, politicians and the Health and Social Care Committee for the Government to implement a national eating disorder strategy for England.  

These calls have been echoed by the researchers who have been leading a three-year project investigating the impact of the rapid transition to remote care during the Covid-19 pandemic on people with eating disorders.

ABSTRACT

Recent findings on the abilities of birds to see in the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum have expanded questions about plumage coloration to include the luminescent characteristics of bird plumage, including fluorescence. Yet little is understood about the function of fluorescent pigments, and very few studies have attempted to describe their distribution throughout a population. In this study, we used a fluorometer to measure variation in the amount of fluorescent pigments (e.g. porphyrins) extracted from the secondary coverts of Long-eared Owls (Asio otus) migrating through the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in the spring of 2020 (n = 99). We found that age and sex were the strongest predictors of fluorescent pigment concentration, wherein older and female birds had the highest fluorescent pigment concentrations. We also found a significant positive relationship between fluorescent pigment concentration and weight in males and small females; however, larger females had no correlation between size and pigment concentration, indicating a potential saturation point for fluorescent pigments in feathers. While we conclude that although fluorescent pigments have the potential to serve as a communicative signal of age, sex, or size, we also acknowledge that these pigments could serve in a function unrelated to signaling, such as heat conservation. More research on these fluorescent pigments and metabolic pathways that lead to their production and deposition in feathers is needed before we can ascribe them a definitive function.

mlaw7xs,1jqzw88,reddit,"Study was just published in the Journal of High Energy Physics. Here's a nice writeup:  


The study details new theoretical structures called “supermazes” that offer a more universal picture of black holes to the field of theoretical physics. Based in string theory, supermazes are pivotal to understanding the structure of black holes on a microscopic level.

“General relativity is a powerful theory for describing the large-scale structure of black holes, but it is a very, very blunt instrument for describing black-hole microstructure,” said Nicholas Warner, co-author of the study and professor of physics, astronomy and mathematics at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. In a framework of theories extending beyond Einstein’s equations, supermazes provide a detailed portrait of the microscopic structure of brane black holes.

“Suppose you wanted a picture of Michelangelo’s Last Judgment: General relativity, with its horizons, is like using a camera with only one pixel,” Warner said. “All you see is a single smear of color. Our earlier work gave us a picture with maybe 1,000 pixels: outlines of structures and some of the shading. Supermazes are like having many, many billions of pixels enabling us to admire the masterpiece in detail.”

  
The new research is centered in M-theory, a theoretical framework in physics that is related to string theory. M-theory posits that strings — the fundamental building blocks of the universe — aren’t one-dimensional. Instead, they exist in higher dimensions as branes, short for “membranes,” which are physical objects that extend in multiple spatial dimensions. Branes have multidimensional surfaces that play a critical role in string theory and M-theory.

“In this paper, we explore intersecting systems of M2-branes (two-dimensional) and M5-branes (five-dimensional) within the realm of supergravity, which is a low-energy approximation of M-theory,” Warner said. “We think of the maze as the ‘substrate’ upon which all the information about whatever made the black hole, or ever fell into it, can be encoded.”

By investigating the maze function that governs these brane intersections, the study reveals how mazes have the capacity to reproduce black hole entropy and potentially describe black hole microstates.

A new approach to mapping out black holes

Brane intersections have been widely studied in string theory, but the new paper re-engineers these ideas to give new geometries that can describe black holes. The study develops a “maze function,” a new mathematical construct that characterizes solutions for intersecting systems of M2 and M5 branes in supergravity. The maze function must obey a nonlinear differential equation similar to the famous Monge-Ampère equation, which governs the geometry and dynamics of M2 and M5 brane intersections.

“Maze functions play a pivotal role in linking the brane configurations to supergravity solutions, which in turn provide a new way to explore black-hole microstates,” Warner said. “The maze function is the billion-pixel camera that can give us a deep and detailed picture of the microstructure of black holes.”

Warner said this is just the first step in a larger program to develop a comprehensive string theory description of brane black hole’s microstructure.",2025-04-04 01:26:09,4,USCDornsifeNews,science

mkzm5st,1jpiuuz,reddit,"Mountain snowpacks accumulate snow throughout the winter, building up stores of water that will supply communities across the American West throughout the long dry season. Now, a new study shows that as storms carry snow to the Rocky Mountains, they are also bringing mercury and other contaminants from mines in the region. The research helps scientists understand how contaminants are spread by atmospheric circulation and has implications for snowpack preservation and illuminating the lasting environmental impact of mining activities.

The study, published in the May issue of the journal Environmental Pollution, examined contamination levels for Mercury, Zinc, Cadmium and Antimony from nearly 50 sites in the Rocky Mountains. DRI’s Monica Arienzo, Associate Research Professor of Hydrology, led the research, along with colleagues from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the University of Nevada, Reno, and Portland State University. They found higher levels of metal contaminants in the northern Rockies and identified mines in the Pacific Northwest, Idaho, and Montana as the likely source by following winter storms back in time. It is one of the first studies to look at metal contamination across the greater Rocky Mountains.

“Metal pollution in the Rockies is relatively understudied,” Arienzo said. “Other studies have focused on certain parts, so the fact that we have this transect from Montana to New Mexico makes this study unique.”

Although contamination levels were found to be within guidelines set by the EPA for both drinking water and aquatic life,  dust can accelerate snowmelt by decreasing the reflectivity of the snowpack. The data can also provide critical information about how environmental contaminants and dust are distributed by the atmosphere.

>RoboBee was not forgotten, with the team focusing this time around on achieving more robust landings. “Previously, if we were to go in for a landing, we’d turn off the vehicle a little bit above the ground and just drop it, and pray that it will land upright and safely,” said co-author Christian Chan, one of Wood's graduate students. The trick is to minimize velocity when approaching a surface and then quickly dissipating impact energy. Even something as small and light as RoboBee can generate significant impact energy. The crane fly has long, jointed appendages that enable them to dampen their landings, so the insect served as a useful model for RoboBee's new landing gear.
>
>The first step was to perform experiments to determine the effects of oscillation on the newly designed robotic legs and leg joints. This involved manually disturbing the leg and then releasing it, capturing the resulting oscillations on high-speed video. This showed that the leg and joint essentially acted as an ""underdamped spring-mass-damper model,"" with a bit of ""viscoelastic creep"" for good measure. Next, the team performed a series of free-fall experiments with small fiberglass crash-test dummy vehicles with mass and inertia similar to RoboBee's, capturing each free fall on high-speed video. This was followed by tests of different takeoff and landing approaches.
>
>The final step was running experiments on consecutive takeoff and landing sequences using RoboBee, with the little robot taking off from one leaf, hovering, then moving laterally before hovering briefly and landing on another leaf nearby. The basic setup was the same as prior experiments, with the exception of placing a plant branch in the motion-capture arena. RoboBee was able to safely land on the second leaf (or similar uneven surfaces) over repeated trials with varying parameters.

Research link: [Sticking the landing: Insect-inspired strategies for safely landing flapping-wing aerial microrobots](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.adq3059)

Abstract:

>For flying insects, the transition from flight to surface locomotion requires effective touchdown maneuvers that allow stable landings on a variety of surfaces. Landing behaviors of insects are diverse, with some using more controlled flight approaches to landing, whereas others dampen collision impacts with parts of their bodies. The landing approaches of real insects inspired our current work, where we present a combined mechanical and control approach to achieving safe and accurate landings for flapping-wing microaerial vehicles. For the mechanical approach to landing, we took inspiration from the legs of the crane fly, designing lossy compliant legs that maximize energy dissipation during surface collisions. We explored three features in the compliant leg design: leg stance, number of joints, and joint placement. For the control approach to landing, the challenge lies in overcoming the aerodynamic ground effect near the surface. Leveraging the compliant leg design during impact, we designed the preimpact behavior, drawing inspiration from insect landing trajectories, to increase landing success. The proposed controlled landing sequence includes an initial acceleration from hovering, followed by deceleration toward the target, ending with a nonzero impact velocity, similar to what is observed in insects. Last, using an insect-scale flapping-wing aerial microrobot platform (Harvard RoboBee), we verified the controlled, safe, and accurate landing on natural terrain.",2025-04-17 12:27:21,3,Hrmbee,science

mkxkd7i,1jp8u4i,reddit,"From the press release:


A research group led by Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine in Japan has uncovered a potential mechanism linking maternal inflammation to delayed neurodevelopment in infants. The research suggests the role of CD11c-positive microglia—immune cells in the brain crucial for myelination—during infant brain development. The results, published in Communications Biology, suggest new strategies to mitigate the long-term neurodevelopmental effects of maternal inflammation. 

Inflammation during pregnancy occurs when the mother’s immune system becomes activated during pregnancy, typically due to an infection, autoimmune response, or environmental factors. It can have negative outcomes for the baby, potentially causing long-term cognitive and behavioral challenges.  

Now, a research team led by Kazuya Fuma and Tomomi Kotani has discovered the role of CD11c-positive microglia in this process. Microglia, the brain's immune cells, play a key role in myelination, the process where nerve fibers are coated with myelin. Myelin is essential for making the nerve cells able to transmit electrical signals efficiently.

moupo7v,1k70eed,reddit,"Abstract

This paper introduces a theoretical framework based on three-dimensional time, where the three temporal dimensions emerge from fundamental symmetry requirements. The necessity for exactly three temporal dimensions arises from observed quantum-classical-cosmological transitions that manifest at three distinct scales: Planck-scale quantum phenomena, interaction-scale processes, and cosmological evolution. These temporal scales directly generate three particle generations through eigenvalue equations of the temporal metric, naturally explaining both the number of generations and their mass hierarchy. The framework introduces a metric structure with three temporal and three spatial dimensions, preserving causality and unitarity while extending standard quantum mechanics and field theory. While earlier work explored three-dimensional time in Kaluza–Klein theory, this paper’s approach provides specific experimental predictions and a complete particle spectrum. This approach provides elegant solutions to long-standing problems in particle physics: the three-generation structure emerges naturally from temporal symmetries, weak interaction parity violation arises from geometric properties, and quantum gravity achieves finite corrections without ultraviolet divergences. The framework accurately reproduces known particle masses, including the top quark (173.21±0.51173.21±0.51GeV, measured 173.2±0.9173.2±0.9GeV), muon (105.6583745±0.0000024105.6583745±0.0000024MeV, measured 105.6583755±0.0000023105.6583755±0.0000023MeV), and electron (0.5109989461±0.00000000310.5109989461±0.0000000031MeV, measured 0.5109989461±0.00000000310.5109989461±0.0000000031MeV). Building on this validation, the theory makes precise quantitative predictions, including neutrino masses (ν3:0.058±0.004ν3:0.058±0.004eV, ν2:0.0086±0.0003ν2:0.0086±0.0003eV), new resonances at M1=2.3±0.4M1=2.3±0.4TeV and M2=4.1±0.6M2=4.1±0.6TeV, and gravitational wave speed modifications of Δv∕c=(1.5±0.3)×10−15Δv∕c=(1.5±0.3)×10−15. These signatures will be testable through next-generation collider experiments, gravitational wave observatories, and cosmological surveys in the 2025–2030 timeframe. Notably, General Relativity emerges as a natural limiting case when two temporal dimensions become negligible. The mathematical consistency and predictive power of this framework, combined with its ability to unify quantum and gravitational phenomena, suggest it deserves consideration as a fundamental theory of physics.",2025-04-24 20:30:30,22,EpiOntic,science

I'll explain this scientific paper in simple terms:

# Three-Dimensional Time Theory Explained Simply

This paper proposes a new way of thinking about time, suggesting that instead of having just one dimension of time (forward/backward), we actually have three dimensions of time, similar to how we have three dimensions of space (up/down, left/right, forward/backward).

## Key Ideas:

1. **Three Time Dimensions**: The theory suggests time has three dimensions that operate at different scales:
   - Tiny quantum scale (atoms and smaller)
   - Medium everyday scale (where we interact with things)
   - Huge cosmological scale (universe-sized)

2. **Explains Particle Generations**: In particle physics, scientists have discovered that many particles come in three ""generations"" or families (like three versions of electrons with different masses). This theory suggests these three generations exist because of the three dimensions of time.

3. **Predicts Particle Masses**: The theory claims to accurately calculate the masses of known particles (like electrons and quarks) and predicts specific masses for particles we haven't measured precisely yet (like neutrinos).

4. **Makes Testable Predictions**: The theory predicts:
   - Specific neutrino masses
   - New particles at specific energy levels (2.3 and 4.1 TeV)
   - Tiny modifications to gravitational wave speed

5. **Connects Quantum Physics and Gravity**: This approach might help solve one of the biggest problems in physics - how to connect quantum mechanics (for tiny things) with gravity (for large things).

The researchers believe this theory could be tested with experiments between 2025-2030, using particle colliders, gravitational wave detectors, and astronomical observations.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",2025-04-25 02:23:20,8,workingmandead,science

Iridescence refers to the optical property of surfaces for which the reflected wavelengths depend on viewing geometry. Although iridescence underlies some of the most striking animal colours, the sensory stimulation elicited by iridescent spectral shifts in relevant observers has seldom been explored. Wall lizards (genus Podarcis), with remarkable intraspecific colour variation and possible iridescence, offer a unique opportunity to investigate how these traits interact to shape overall colour appearance. Here, we set out to study iridescence in Podarcis liolepis in two localities in which lizards differ in dorsal coloration: the València Botanical Garden (EB) and La Murta Natural Park (LM). To determine the presence of angle-dependent reflectance, we measured dorsal coloration at three different configurations (0°, 60° and 90° angles between incident light and observer location) in 87 lizards of either sex and used visual modelling to determine their detectability when viewed by conspecifics, raptors and humans. Our results show that P. liolepis dorsal coloration varies chromatically with sex and locality and also shows iridescence (i.e. reflectance peaks at shorter wavelengths with increasing viewing angle). Lizards from EB are brown dorsally, whereas most lizards from LM, especially males, show a green dorsal background coloration, reflectance peaking at shorter wavelengths in lizards from LM compared to lizards from EB. Angle-dependent shifts in peak location are smaller in LM males than in other groups, yet iridescence appears more pronounced (i.e. larger chromatic distances between viewing angles) in LM than in EB due to greater overlap between the involved waveband and receiver cone sensitivities. Additionally, P. liolepis dorsal iridescence may be more noticeable to humans and raptors than to lizards. Our findings suggest that intraspecific colour variation influences iridescence detectability across observers, underscoring the need for objective colour quantification and visual modelling to assess the ecological consequences of animal coloration.",2025-04-12 16:13:28,1,uglytroglodite,science

momehe4,1k5xbwf,reddit,"University ag. scientist here. I took a look at the paper itself and caught a few red flags.

The biggest one is in the experimental design. They had three main treatments in field applications. No fertilizer, NPK fertilizer (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium), and manure fertilizer. That's perfectly fine for most agronomic studies. The problem here is when they lead with resistance genes being the main focus of this paper, that means they have no true control group and effects are confounding with manure use overall. If that was the intended focus of the research from the start, you would have had a manure treatment from a farm not using antibiotics and focused on the difference between those two manure types. Normally papers get rejected for not having an appropriate control group like that.

Looking at their statistics, I'm seeing a couple things that would bump up a false positive rate (finding a statistical difference when there is none), especially using Duncan's test for multiple comparisons. Combine that with looking at the figures and seeing that the NPK fertilizer and manure fertilizer groups visually look like they're not statistically different, I've already got my red flag up where I'd normally check the stats the authors provided during a peer-review. The problem here is that the paper doesn't include all the information normally required (e.g. degrees of freedom) when doing the kind of statistical analysis they did. Normally reviewers use that to see if the authors coded the analysis correctly, especially when there's a suspect issue like this. I've lost count of how many times I've reviewed an article having to ask the authors to provide that information only to find out they didn't specify the model correctly and their former significant difference no longer exists.

Related to that, the trend showing up here is that resistance genes are being found generally at higher rates in NPK fertilized fields than non-fertilized, and at least at somewhat similar rates as manure applied fields. With that, I'd be really cautious about the kind of headline in this post leading with manure, but also about the overall experimental design on the study. Even I'm having trouble drawing concrete implications without having to pause and be really careful. It's not really clear if the authors are trying to say manure is introducing the antibiotic resistance genes or if they're just saying conditions are better for microbes overall in manure so you see all measurements of microbe activity (including carbon processing and antibiotic resistance) increase. Even in the case of the latter, you have to be careful in how you describe that nuance.",2025-04-23 15:20:56,1,braconidae,science

mn756tz,1jzlyvw,reddit,"**Pulsed Electrochemical Exfoliation for an HF-Free Sustainable MXene Synthesis**

Abstract

MXenes are a 2D materials (2DM) class with high industrialization potential, owing to their superb properties and compositional variety. However, ensuring high etching efficiency in the synthesis process without involving toxic, hazardous or non-sustainable chemicals are challenging. In this work, an upscalable electrochemical MXene synthesis is presented. This novel protocol uses a non-toxic and sustainable sodium tetrafluoroborate/hydrochloric acid (NaBF4/HCl) electrolyte and increases etching efficiency by applying cathodic pulsing via pulse voltammetry. Hydrogen bubble formation restores electrochemical activity, and effectively supports 2D-sheet removal, allowing continuous etching at higher yields in situ. In detail, yields of up to 60% electrochemical MXene (EC-MXene) with no byproducts from a single exfoliation cycle are achieved. EC-MXene had an excellent quality with high purity as assessed using chemical mapping by scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive electron spectroscopy (SEM/EDX) and surface termination analysis performed with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and, for the first time, with low energy ion scattering (LEIS). Further properties of EC-MXenes such as dimensions and adhesion energy of single flakes, vibrational peaks, and interlayer spacing are provided by atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy (Raman), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) respectively. Pulsed electrochemical synthesis is key to surface reactivation at the electrodes' interface, which results in improved exfoliation and quality of EC-MXenes. This paves the way for scaling up and green industrialization of MXenes.

mm81jee,1jv7yxp,reddit,">It’s a bright day for computing — literally.

>Two tech companies have unveiled computer components that use laser light to process information. These futuristic processors could soon solve specific real-world problems faster and with lower energy requirements than conventional computers. The announcements, published separately April 9 in *Nature*, mark a major leap forward for this alternative approach to computing.

>Lightelligence, based in Boston, and Lightmatter, in Mountain View, Calif., have shown that light-based, or photonic, components “can do things that we care about, and that they can do them better than electronic chips that we already have,” says Anthony Rizzo, a photonics engineer at Dartmouth College who was not involved in either study.

>Lasers already zap data across the world via [fiber optic cables](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/clam-fiber-optics-symbiotic-algae), and photonics plays a role in moving data in advanced data centers. In March, for example, tech company NVIDIA, based in Santa Clara, Calif., announced [new technology that uses light to communicate between devices](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-spectrum-x-co-packaged-optics-networking-switches-ai-factories). But, Rizzo says, these light beams don’t compute anything. Inside a conventional computer, incoming light signals are transformed into slower electronic 1s and 0s that move through tiny transistors.

ml70g2x,1jqhx60,reddit,"From the press release:

A person’s level of political engagement can be informed by myriad factors, from education to environment. Now, a new study — published in the journal Brain and led by Northwestern University and Shirley Ryan AbilityLab — has for the first time identified which brain networks regulate political passion.

The study analyzed Vietnam War veterans with and without brain injuries. By comparing people who had very localized brain lesions with those who didn’t, the study team was able to identify the brain structures that can modify the intensity of political feelings.

Damage to the prefrontal cortex, a region responsible for cognitive control and reasoning, led to an increase in the intensity of political feelings. Conversely, damage to the amygdala, a brain structure involved in emotional processing, decreased political intensity in participants. These findings held true even after accounting for factors like age, education, party affiliation, personality traits and other neuropsychiatric symptoms.

“While most people have not sustained brain injuries akin to those experienced by the veterans in the study, our findings tell us what neural circuits are at play for the population at large,” said senior author Jordan Grafman, professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and director of brain injury research at Shirley Ryan AbilityLab.

“We didn’t find brain networks tied to liberal or conservative ideology, but we identified circuits that influence the intensity of political engagement across the political spectrum,” Grafman added. “This suggests that factors like emotion shape how pre-existing political beliefs are expressed, rather than determining ideology itself.”

mks7qea,1joj6po,reddit,"A recently published paper authored by van Weelden et al. and posted by Bay Cetology analyzes the acquisition of teeth rake marks scars and the healing rates of these rake mark scars in three different orcas populations: The West Coast Transient community of Bigg's (transient) orcas in the Pacific Northwest, the Northern Resident orcas in the Pacific Northwest, and the Crozet Island orcas in the sub-antarctic Indian Ocean.

Bigg's orcas eat mammals, Northern Resident orcas only eat fish, and Crozet Island orcas are known to eat both fish and mammals.

Rake mark scars can be cause by mild to intense play and aggression.

Despite the large differences between the social structures, ecologies, and other behaviours within each of these different orca populations, with the Bigg's orcas and the resident orcas each belonging to their own subspecies, the researchers found out that there were actually no significant differences in scar acquisition between these populations.

As stated in the paper, ""The similarity in scarring rates between populations therefore suggest that resource type, abundance, and associated lifestyles do not play a significant role in determining the kinds of physical interactions between all sex and age classes that result in scars.""

Other discoveries include the following:

* Male orcas in all age classes accrue more rake marks than female orcas in their respective age classes on average. This suggests that many of the behaviours resulting in rake mark scars are sexually selected and could potentially be attributed to reproductive competition between males.

* There is an inverse relationship between age and rake mark scar acquisition. Calves (age of less than 3 years) and juveniles (age between 4 and 12 years) had the highest acquisition rates of scars. Male subadults (age between 13 and 20 years) and then male adults (age over 20 years) had the next highest scar acquisitions rates respectively. Female adults (age between 13 and 40 years) and post-reproductive female adults (age over 40 years) had the second lowest and the lowest scar acquisition rates respectively. Higher scarring rates amongst younger individuals is a phenomenon similar to that seen in bottlenose dolphins, but is quite different to that seen in many other mammalian species. This may be due to these scars being acquired through social play, attempts to establish dominance amongst peers in younger age classes, and coercive behaviours by males directed towards the offspring of potential mates. Male orcas could exhibit physical aggression towards calves without going to the extreme of killing the calves in order to coerce their mothers into cooperating. Male orca calves may be more scarred than female orca calves because they could be viewed as future competitors by male aggressors.

* While scar acquisition was similar across populations, the scar healing rates amongst Northern Resident orcas were significantly higher than those in the Bigg's and Crozet Islands orcas. This is likely due to the rake scars seen amongst Northern Resident orcas being significantly less severe on average. Northern Resident orcas live in large stable pods composed of their maternal families and extended relatives, and there is rarely any immigration or emigration from these pods. The social dynamics within this population could mean decreased rates of aggression that may result in more severe rake mark scars. On the other hand, interaction with more unfamiliar conspecifics could be possibly correlated with more severe rake scars seen in Bigg's and Crozet Islands orca communities, which have looser social structures.

* The scars of male orcas healed slightly faster than those of female orcas. This could mean that the scars resulting from sexually selected behaviours, and that the physical impacts of sexual coercion on females could be more severe than the effects of retaliation by females against aggressor males or sexual competition between males. However, this contrasts with findings from another study showing that female bottlenose dolphins healed faster than male bottlenose dolphins, likely due to the positive effects of estrogen on cellular regeneration.

* Despite having great acquisition of scars, calves and juveniles healed more quickly than adults. More superficial scars on juveniles could be acquired by play. However, an alternative physiological explanation for why scars on juveniles healed more quickly is due to the effects of cellular aging.

* Healing time could be significantly affected based on the locations of the rake mark scars on the bodies of orcas. For example, scars on dorsal fins healed slightly faster than those on flanks.

The larger family pods of Northern Resident orcas could also provide more protection of pod members against external aggression compared to the smaller pods of Bigg's orcas.",2025-04-01 00:59:39,2,SurayaThrowaway12,science

mn2u3hs,1jyx79h,reddit,"*Parking policies are a key factor in reducing car usage and improving liveability in urban neighbourhoods, as they link transport and land use. However, policymakers face the challenge of designing parking policies that effectively address local car parking issues while ensuring acceptability within the same neighbourhood. Our empirical analysis aims to develop a typology of different parking policies based on residents’ acceptability. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of spatial differences on the acceptability of parking policies, focusing on the residential neighbourhood and car parking characteristics. We derive our findings from a quantitative household survey (N=1,186) we conducted in eight neighbourhoods in the two German cities of Darmstadt and Frankfurt am Main. Applying principal component analysis (PCA) to 31 initial parking policies, we identify six policy types: (1) parking restrictions and enforcement, (2) conversion of parking space for liveability, (3) conversion of parking space for mobility services, (4) parking space conversion accompanied by additional measures, (5) additional neighbourhood garages and (6) limited parking for SUVs. Our results show that push measures are both among the most accepted and rejected policies, with restrictions for SUVs being generally more popular than those for regular cars. Moreover, we find that the acceptability of the conversion of parking spaces depends on the proposed alternative land use and accompanying additional measures. Despite some disparities, residents are more supportive of parking space conversions for liveability (e.g. greenery) than for alternative mobility services (e.g. car sharing stations). Our results also highlight the important role of the neighbourhood level when setting parking policies. Multivariate analyses indicate that the residential neighbourhood and car parking characteristics, such as the usual parking location, duration and distance from home, influence the acceptability of parking policies. Policymakers might, therefore, consider the local parking situation to be changed in a neighbourhood, the specific target groups to be addressed by a policy and the benefits for residents to be promoted by a transformation of on-street car parking.*",2025-04-14 15:47:26,2,vingeran,science

mlc9lix,1jr6k2g,reddit,"A new study sheds light on how prehistoric hunter-gatherer populations in Europe coped with climate changes over 12,000 years ago. Led by scientists from the University of Cologne, a team of 25 prehistoric archaeologists from twenty European universities and research institutions revealed significant shifts in population size and density during key periods at the end of the last Ice Age, specifically during the Final Palaeolithic between 14,000 and 11,600 years ago. The study has been published in PLOS One under the title ‘Large scale and regional demographic responses to climatic changes in Europe during the Final Palaeolithic’.

The results reveal that the first establishment of a larger human population in north-eastern central Europe during the Final Palaeolithic was followed by a dramatic population decline during the last cold period (Greenland Stadial 1) of the Ice Age. This decline reduced the total population of Europe by half. However, the study found that some areas in central Europe show stability or even a slight increase in population size against the general trend. The team interprets this finding as evidence of human migration towards the east in response to worsening climate conditions.

By compiling a comprehensive database on archaeological sites from this period and using a cutting-edge geostatistical method called the Cologne Protocol, the researchers estimated population sizes and densities of prehistoric humans across different regions of Europe. The protocol provides a standardised procedure to estimate prehistoric demographic data, allowing for diachronic comparisons. The identified shifts in regional population sizes provide new insights into how early humans responded to the environmental challenges of their time.

mn74jtl,1jzlvg8,reddit,"**Deep-sea mining and its risks for social-ecological systems: Insights from simulation-based analyses**

Abstract

The pros and cons of deep-sea mining (DSM) is currently hotly debated. Here, we assess the environmental, economic, and social risks of DSM by comparing scenarios with and without DSM involvement. The “Without” scenario relies solely on land-based mining and circular economy solutions, while the “With” scenario incorporates DSM alongside circular strategies, highlighting the dangers of heavy DSM dependence. Through literature review and expert interviews, our study identifies key risk indicators across environmental, economic, and social dimensions, forming a comprehensive assessment framework. Through the application of qualitative data and fuzzy cognitive mapping, the analysis reveals that environmental factors are the most influential (centrality: 1.46), followed by social (1.32) and economic (1.0) factors. In the “With DSM” scenario, all indicators show increased risks, with environmental factors, particularly “coastal state vulnerability,” experiencing a 13% rise. Social risks, including “violation of law,” “participatory rights,” “lack of effective control,” and “degraded reputation,” increase by 8–11%, while economic risks, such as “contractual violations,” “lack of special provision,” “knowledge gap on economic assistance fund” and disputes among “multiple stakeholders,” see an 11% uptick. Our results suggest that the risks DSM poses to deep-sea marine ecosystems are likely too significant to justify its pursuit and advocates for circular economy solutions as viable alternatives to mitigate environmental, social, and economic risks. We recommend that policies should promote circular practices through resource recovery incentives.

„Abstract
Phage satellites are defined as viruses that have a life cycle dependent on a helper virus. Thus, they are often considered as parasites of parasites, although recent work suggests it may be more accurate to consider them as symbionts that evolved along a parasitism–mutualism continuum. Over the past years, multiple studies have examined the fascinating life cycle of these elements, focusing on the characterization of the molecular mechanisms they use to hijack the helper phage machinery for their own packaging and transfer. As some phage satellites encode toxins and other virulence and resistance genes, the impact of these elements on bacterial virulence has also been extensively analysed. Recent studies suggest that satellites have unprecedented roles in the ecology and evolution of bacteria and their mobile genetic elements. In this Review, we explore the genetics and the life cycle of these elements, with special emphasis on the new mechanisms involved in their spread in nature. We discuss the unexpected impact of these elements on the evolution of other mobile genetic elements and their host bacteria, and examine their potential origins.“

So these phage satellites seem to contribute a lot in the evoution and biology of bacteria.",2025-03-27 13:52:41,3,DocumentExternal6240,science

mkoxk8k,1jo4rx0,reddit,"**Background/Objectives**: Assess the ability of ChatGPT-4 (GPT-4) to effectively triage patient messages sent to the general eye clinic at our institution. 

**Methods**: Patient messages sent to the general eye clinic via MyChart were de-identified and then triaged by an ophthalmologist-in-training (MD) as well as GPT-4 with two main objectives. Both MD and GPT-4 were asked to direct patients to either general or specialty eye clinics, urgently or nonurgently, depending on the severity of the condition. Main Outcomes: GPT-4s ability to accurately direct patient messages to (1) a general or specialty eye clinic and (2) determine the time frame within which the patient needed to be seen (triage acuity). Accuracy was determined by comparing percent agreement with recommendations given by GPT-4 with those given by MD. 

**Results**: The study included 139 messages. Percent agreement between the ophthalmologist-in-training and GPT-4 was 64.7% for general/specialty clinic recommendation and 60.4% for triage acuity. Cohen’s kappa was 0.33 and 0.67 for specialty clinic and triage urgency, respectively. GPT-4 recommended a triage acuity equal to or sooner than ophthalmologist-in-training for 93.5% of cases and recommended a less urgent triage acuity in 6.5% of cases. 

**Conclusions**: Our study indicates an AI system, such as GPT-4, should complement rather than replace physician judgment in triaging ophthalmic complaints. These systems may assist providers and reduce the workload of ophthalmologists and ophthalmic technicians as GPT-4 becomes more adept at triaging ophthalmic issues. Additionally, the integration of AI into ophthalmic triage could have therapeutic implications by ensuring timely and appropriate care, potentially improving patient outcomes by reducing delays in treatment. Combining GPT-4 with human expertise can improve service delivery speeds and patient outcomes while safeguarding against potential AI pitfalls.",2025-03-31 14:40:55,1,goodoneforyou,science

mn743r5,1jzlsyy,reddit,"**Visual target and task-critical feedback uncertainty impair different stages of reach planning in motor cortex**

Abstract

Sensory uncertainty jeopardizes accurate movement. During reaching, visual uncertainty can affect the estimation of hand position (feedback) and the desired movement endpoint (target). While impairing motor learning, it is unclear how either form of uncertainty affects cortical reach goal encoding. We show that reach trajectories vary more with higher visual uncertainty of the target, but not the feedback. Accordingly, cortical motor goal activities in male rhesus monkeys are less accurate during planning and movement initiation under target but not feedback uncertainty. Yet, when monkeys critically depend on visual feedback to conduct reaches via a brain-computer interface, then visual feedback uncertainty impairs reach accuracy and neural motor goal encoding around movement initiation. Neural state space analyses reveal a dimension that separates population activity by uncertainty level in all tested conditions. Our findings demonstrate that while both target and feedback uncertainty always reflect in neural activity, uncertain feedback only deteriorates neural reach goal information and behavior when it is task-critical, i.e., when having to rely on the sensory feedback and no other more reliable sensory modalities are available. Further, uncertain target and feedback impair reach goal encoding in a time-dependent manner, suggesting that they are integrated during different stages of reach planning.

mo2m2hq,1k3jn3l,reddit,"This was published in a journal previously accused of being predatory.

https://www.predatoryjournals.org/news/is-mdpi-predatory

>MDPI was included on Jeffrey Beall’s list of predatory open access publishing companies in February 2014. Beall’s concern was that “MDPI’s warehouse journals contain hundreds of lightly-reviewed articles that are mainly written and published for promotion and tenure purposes rather than to communicate science.” Beall also claimed that MDPI used email spam to solicit manuscripts and that the company listed researchers, including Nobel laureates, on their editorial boards without their knowledge.

>In August 2018, 10 senior editors (including the editor-in-chief) of the journal Nutrients resigned, alleging that MDPI forced the replacement of the editor-in-chief because of his high editorial standards and for resisting pressure to “accept manuscripts of mediocre quality and importance.”

>In December 2020, the Chinese Academy of Sciences published a list of journals that may suffer from issues of scientific quality and other risk characteristics. There were 22 MDPI group journals in the 65 journals given in its initial list. MDPI responded to the list promising to communicate with the academy and improve its journals’ parameters to remove the affected journals from the list as soon as possible. The list was updated in December 2021 and reduced to only 41 journals, of which seven MDPI journals were included.

>In 2021, the executive committee of the National Publication Committee announced the creation of a new level X for possibly predatory journals and publishers, and linked the creation of the new level specifically to the many expressions of concern regarding MDPI. Currently, 2 MDPI journals have a rating of “level X” and 10 have a rating of “non-academic” (level 0).",2025-04-20 10:54:44,10,Cat_Or_Bat,science

Since 2011, Geier's medical license has been suspended or revoked in every state in which he was licensed over concerns about his autism treatments and his misrepresentation of his credentials to the Maryland Board of Health, to which he falsely claimed to be a board-certified geneticist and epidemiologist.

>Geier and his son David Geier are frequently cited by proponents of the discredited claim that vaccines cause autism. Geier's credibility as an expert witness has been questioned in 10 court cases. In 2003, a judge ruled that Geier presented himself as an expert witness in ""areas for which he has no training, expertise and experience."" In other cases in which Geier has testified, judges have labeled his testimony ""intellectually dishonest"", ""not reliable"" and ""wholly unqualified"".

mmhc27r,1jwc1h0,reddit,"Before I noticed who the authors were (notorious anti-vaxxers, as nicely caught first by u/tejota), the first thing that jumped out at me was that study compared fluoridated vs. non-fluoridated rather than the \_amount\_ of fluoride in the water.

From what I've read, the only thing that the decently designed studies to date have suggested is that there could possibly be some issues with using fluoride in more than the recommended amounts. So this wouldn't have impressed me much even if it were done by reputable scientists.",2025-04-11 00:06:15,11,MathAndMirth,science
mmhfzbb,1jwc1h0,reddit,"How is the word ""significant"" being used here? The words ""slight, but significant"" could make sense in terms of a slight change causing a significant impact, but this sentence seems like both words are being used to describe the same thing: a sought correlation between early fluoride exposure and disorders which, even setting aside the people attached, is being described as both ""slight"" and ""significant.""",2025-04-11 00:29:56,3,Sintar07,science
