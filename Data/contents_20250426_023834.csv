* I’m skipping beach/coastal spots for now since we have plenty of those back home.
* I love cool weather, hiking, nature, history, and the countryside.
* I’ll be flying into Saigon (planning to stay there for 3–4 days) but I’m mostly interested in exploring Central to Northern Vietnam.

1jlbct1,reddit,Why do Vietnamese have different chess rules than the rest of the world?,"My kids and I play chess. We follow the international rules. Sometimes they play chess at school with their friends. A few years ago my kids told me that the kids at school play with different rules. I haven't bothered learning the Vietnamese rules but my kids have explained a couple of them to me. For example, you don't trap the king (as you do in international rules), you capture it (ie, removing it from the board). You don't say ""check"" when you put the opponent's king into check. If you don't realize you are in check and you try to move another piece (that doesn't block the check), it is a mistake/error and you can only make a couple of such errors without losing the game. Some really weird rules that I figured the school kids made up, because they are kids and kids do weird/dumb things sometimes.

But.... today I learned that there is a teacher at their school who is teaching them all chess. There's a city-wide tournament coming up and this teacher is the official teacher/coach for the school. And he's teaching them these same Vietnamese rules, not the international rules accepted by FIDE. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIDE)

It seems pretty silly to teach the kids a different set of rules. What if they did this with football? It would make Vietnamese players/teams totally unable to compete internationally. Well, that's what they're doing by teaching the kids the wrong chess rules.

1k4htrr,reddit,"How many days do I need each in Da Nang, Hue and Hoi An (and elsewhere?) with a food focus?","I'm planning a first-ever visit (solo) to Vietnam and looking at central Vietnam for 7-10 days. My main focus is on the food, ""grazing"" as much as I can throughout each day and hopefully filling in the ""in-between"" time with interesting things to do. I like food markets, hanging in coffee shops, observing people, learning about culture/history, etc. Definitely not a beach-dweller. Not big on big crowds and over-tourism, but can tolerate a bit for the sake of good food.

So, given this, how many days/nights would you recommend I spend each in Da Nang (will probably fly in to this airport), Hue and Hoi An? Or maybe you have recommendation of elsewhere to explore in central Vietnam? (I will likely go to Ho Chi Minh City from central VN to spend a couple of days before flying home.)

My sense (maybe wrong) is that Da Nang is the largest with lots of places to eat, but not much else besides the beach? Hoi An looks like an easy day-trip if I don't want to get hotels in all three cities, but despite it's touristic feel, maybe the food warrants additional time? Hue seems the most chill of the three places, so I was considering three nights unless that's too many.

1jw2j39,reddit,Should I Move to Vietnam,"Hello folks,

So I joined Reddit to ask this question. 

I work for a Swiss based consumer goods company in India. I got promoted and now they’re sending me to Vietnam , Ho Chi Minh City in a leadership position. My move date is on 5th of May this year and till now I haven’t been researching much about life as an indian in vietnam.

For a week or so I researched and my research on YouTube, this forum, and forums like trip advisor, travel fish, and VBF left me thinking if I as an indian should move there.

I realized that my country men and women don’t carry a good image in Vietnam, for reasons that I don’t find implausible, but nevertheless I am quite worried about unnecessary intense micro aggressions , starkly askances and most importantly social ostracization. There a ton of videos on YouTube that I saw recently where many Indians reported rude and disrespectful behavior from locals. I am not doing any blame or shame here, I am just sharing what I found.

A good friend of mine, who is an Indian, is a CFO for Unilever Vietnam, he too asked me to think twice before moving to Vietnam. His case is a bit different though, he lives in Singapore for 20 odd days in Vietnam and the rest of the 10 days in Vietnam.

Now the thing is that I wouldn’t have to navigate when I move into the city. My housing, car and household help everything will be ready before I land. So I am sure I would not be facing any landlord denying me housing because I am form india. 

But I am quite worried what would life be if I go out for a coffee or for a dinner in a nice restaurant. There are tons of YouTube videos from indian travelers stating that they’re not allowed to enter and even chased away.

I know many of you will say do not come and will unleash a string of vilification because of where I am from. But if you give it a thought, and if you were at my place, what would you have done? Also what do the locals in this forum recommend. 

Thanks in advance for any constructive criticism and practical feedback.",2025-04-10 16:46:05,VietNam,VietNam,news,News,[],0,4,52,,0.55,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1jw2j39/should_i_move_to_vietnam/,pitsnvulva69

In 1940, the Nam Kỳ Khởi Nghĩa (Southern Uprising) marked a pivotal moment in Vietnam’s struggle against French colonial rule, foreshadowing the nationwide resistance of 1945. The people of southern Vietnam revolted, and for the first time, the red flag with a yellow star flew defiantly at Đình Long Hưng in Châu Thành district, Tiền Giang province.

This flag, designed to symbolize the unity and revolutionary spirit of the Vietnamese people, became an emblem of resistance against colonial oppression. Although the uprising was ultimately suppressed, the image of the red flag with a yellow star flying high left an indelible mark, galvanizing the movement for independence.

Lãnh Bình Cẩn, born Nguyễn Văn Cẩn in Mỹ Lợi village, Kiến Đăng district, was a key figure in southern Vietnam’s resistance against the French from 1861 to 1866. As a skilled military leader, he achieved numerous victories, often alongside other historical figures such as Nguyễn Hữu Huân.

Renowned for his organizational abilities and dedication to the cause, Lãnh Bình Cẩn played a crucial role in keeping the resistance alive, inspiring the local population with his unyielding spirit. After his passing in 1902, his legacy remains a testament to the resilience and patriotism of those who fought to defend their homeland.

1k48jmw,reddit,15kg luggage limit on bus ( 12go dot asia ),"EDIT FOR FUTURE REFERENCE: they did not check or seem to care.

TL;DR do they actually check this?   
  
Hi all! Right now im looking at booking a bus to travel from Hanoi to different city. While booking i read the following on the site: 

""Your luggage should not exceed 15 kg weight for bus trips and 10 kg for van trips. If you carry a large bag or suitcase we recommend to buy an additional seat in the van.""

I have a large travel backpack as well as a normal one, with a combined weight thats over 15kg (probably not by a lot but still). I guess this won't matter a lot but just wanted to double check here since its the first time ill be using this way of transportation. The backpack i want to keep with me at any time but obviously the big bag can go in the storage area.

""Phan Hiển Đạo (1829 - 1883), người làng Vĩnh Kim Đông, tỉnh Định Tường, nay là thành phố Mỹ Tho. Ông đỗ tiến sĩ năm 1858 đời vua Tự Đức, là người tài hoa, giỏi âm nhạc.""

**Direct English Translation:**  
""Phan Hien Dao (1829–1883), from Vinh Kim Dong village, Dinh Tuong province (now My Tho city), passed his doctorate examination in 1858 under the reign of Emperor Tu Duc. He was a talented person, especially skilled in music.""

Phan Hien Dao (1829–1883) was an important historical figure in the Nguyen dynasty, known for his talents and extensive knowledge. He was born in Vinh Kim Dong village, Dinh Tuong province (now My Tho city). In 1858, during the reign of Emperor Tu Duc, he earned the title of Doctor, affirming his position in the country's academic and intellectual circles.

Phan Hien Dao was not only skilled in literature but also a talented musician. His works contributed to Vietnam’s cultural heritage during a time of great social and political change. Although the country faced challenges under French colonial pressure, his artistic and academic achievements reflect the resilience and creativity of Vietnamese intellectuals of that era.

Phan Hien Dao’s life and career left a lasting legacy in Vietnamese history. His cultural contributions continue to be remembered as a testament to the vibrant intellectual and artistic traditions of the Nguyen dynasty.

1k2v7r3,reddit,Lost Passport in International Mail – Any Advice or Similar Experiences?,"Hi everyone,

I'm hoping someone here might have experienced something similar or can offer some guidance.

About a month ago, I had a newly issued European passport shipped to me while I was traveling in Vietnam. The passport was sent from Portugal with a tracking number. On the last tracking update, the letter passed through the UK on its way to Vietnam—but since then, there have been no further updates. Vietnam Post doesn't have the tracking number in their system.



So far, I've taken the following steps:

Contacted UK Border Force, in case the letter was intercepted at a postal import hub there.

Contacted Vietnam Customs, asking whether the item may be held or delayed on their end.

Contacted Portuguese Customs, in case the passport was never properly dispatched or got held up before leaving the country.


Filed an official complaint with CTT (Portugal's postal service) using the Livro Vermelho (their official complaint system).


The passport contains no visa or sensitive insert—just a standard new document—but I’m now in limbo with no clear idea where it is or who might have it. I’ve provided all relevant details, including the passport number, to the authorities mentioned above, and I'm currently waiting to hear back.

Has anyone else experienced a similar situation with an international passport shipment getting lost or stuck in transit between countries? Any tips or ideas on what to do next would be hugely appreciated.

1k2syc2,reddit,Digital Nomad Couple  - coming to VT for 40 days - Last week of May / All June. Where should we base ourselves?,"**Looking for Advice: Nha Trang vs. Da Nang (or maybe near Hoi An?) for Remote Working Couple in Our 40s**

Hey everyone,

I've gone down the Reddit rabbit hole and read pretty much everything I can find about Nha Trang and Da Nang, but I still have a few final questions I'd love some input on from the hive mind! 😊

We’re an Australian couple in our 40s, currently slow-traveling and working remotely (posting this from Sri Lanka!). We’re not on holiday in the traditional sense—we’re still working full-time while trying to build a healthy, sustainable lifestyle as we move around.

We’ll be leaving Sri Lanka soon (visa limits), and I’m looking at Vietnam as our next base—ideally for at least a month or two.

# What we’re looking for:

* A **quiet**, comfortable place to live and work
* A **solid daily routine** with a good gym, healthy food, and a bit of exploring
* Definitely **not into the party scene**—we’re 90% sober, so nightlife isn’t a priority
* Walkable area preferred, with access to cafes, gyms, and decent groceries

# Weather:

According to ChatGPT (and other sources), it sounds like **Nha Trang has better weather** this time of year, while **Da Nang can be hit or miss with rain**. That’s nudging me toward Nha Trang, but I’m open to being convinced otherwise.

# About Nha Trang / Da Nang:

* I keep reading about the ""Russian invasion"" in Nha Trang—kind of like the Dubai Marina or Bali vibes? If it’s just a lot of tourists and a few tired buildings, we can manage that.
* We’re *not* looking for beachfront luxury—just a **quality apartment in a quiet area**, near food and gyms.
* Any thoughts on avoiding buildings like Gold Coast or Panorama in Nha Trang? I’ve seen complaints about overcrowding, elevators, and disrepair—reminds me of some high-rise issues in Dubai.

# Also considering: somewhere just outside Hoi An?

Is this a viable option for remote work and daily gym access, or would it be too quiet / inconvenient?

**So my main question: Based on all this, where would you base yourself—Nha Trang, Da Nang, or near Hoi An? And which specific neighborhoods or buildings would you recommend for a quiet, health-focused lifestyle?**

\*\*Thanks to chatGPT for helping me clean up this post \*\*

1k2c4qd,reddit,"Capella Hanoi vs. Sofitel Metropole Hanoi June 28-July 1, 2025","Hi Everyone,

I am trying decide what to do for stay June 28-July 1st. Deciding between booking two basic rooms at either Capella or Sofitel Opera Wing with FHR benefits. The Sofitel is cheaper, however, I am betting on hopefully getting upgraded to a basic Heritage room which on the website appears to be one category higher than the basic opera wing room. Has anyone heard of this happening?

The Capella is approximately 60 USD more per night. Worth it? Or Sofitel? Not sure what to do. Any advice would help.

Other stays prior to arriving in Hanoi are:

\- Park Hyatt Saigon

\- Six Senses Ninh Van bay

\- Amanoi

\- Intercontinental Danang Sun Peninsula

\- Anantara Hoi An vs Four Seasons Nam Hai

\- Azerai La Residences Hue

\- Deciding on staying overnight in the middle of our stay in Hanoi to stay at Tam Coc Garden (June 29-30 whilst Hanoi stay is 6/28-7/1) to visit Ninh Binh rather than an exhausting day trip \*this is why Stay 3 Pay 2 at Capella is a bit more enticing, yet still cheaper than paying the nightly rate at Sofitel.

1k22ma9,reddit,"I Regretted Signing Up, but the Gym Is Keeping My Deposit for 90 Days","
I recently went to California Fitness for what they advertised as a free 30-day trial.

But when I arrived, I didn’t get to try anything. Instead, I was sat down and sold to for the entire session by a staff member. They told me to come back the next day for a “free personal training” session to try things out properly.

On the second day, I went for what I thought was just a trial PT session. The trainer reassured me there would be no sales. But after the session, a staff member sat me down and tried to sell me a 24-month membership installment plan. I refused, clearly said I wasn’t ready — then they brought out another staff member to pressure me again.

After intense pressure, I caved and gave a 6 million VND deposit, thinking I’d just go home and cancel if I felt unsure.

But when I tried to cancel (the same evening), they said I needed to do it in person. When I returned, they told me no refunds, and offered to convert the deposit into 8 PT sessions instead. They also claimed they had already opened a loan for me with Sacombank before 7PM — even though I hadn’t signed anything for that.

Eventually, after more pushing, they said they’d refund my money — but it would take 90 days.

I’ve received zero services, signed nothing with the bank, and now my money is being held hostage for 3 months. I feel tricked.

1k1jwfq,reddit,Poland vs Russia on Facebook: Who’s rewriting WWII history?,"

I came across a Facebook post where the Polish Embassy and Russian Embassy are going at it over WWII history. 

Link here if you’re curious:https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1Chzgz4obU/?mibextid=wwXIfr


(*) Poland claims the USSR helped Nazi Germany secretly rebuild its military after WWI—citing joint training centers for tanks and aircraft in Soviet cities like Kazan and Lipetsk, all starting with the 1922 Treaty of Rapallo. They say Russia now uses ""fighting Nazism"" to justify the war in Ukraine.


(*) Russia fired back, saying those programs ended in 1933, and that Poland actually signed a pact with Hitler in 1934—implying Poland was no less cooperative with Nazi Germany.


I’m no history expert, but a few things stood out:

- Poland’s post feels like they could do better in listing the facts and examples. From the museums and research I've read, there are more solid facts for them to prove their points. The one from this post seems a little bit weak.


- Most Vietnamese commenters sided with Russia and called Poland the traitor.


- A lot of arguments of Vietnamese people in comment section came from school textbooks, which feels a bit one-sided. History, especially war history, needs more than just one narrative.
-> That's is the reason for this question.


- I’ve talked to some European friends into history, and they said Russia’s been playing the aggressor card in the region for a long time—even pre-WWII.

-> It suggests that Russia has never been a reliable ally, and that’s why neighboring countries have always felt the need to band together—like joining NATO today—to protect themselves from its influence

=> So here’s my question to people who study history or just know their stuff:
- What’s your take on Russia and Poland’s roles before WWII?
- How were you taught this part of history—especially if you grew up in Vietnam or outside the West?

Genuinely curious how the narrative shifts depending on where you’re from.

My question about the costs of notarisation is to see if I should pre notarise the original documents in the UK, send the originals back from Vietnam myself via DHL courier or something similar, or keep the originals at home and have a parent sort the notarisation for me and send them to me in Vietnam.

  
I would hesitate to do it before I leave, as I may end up not getting a job before the 6 months validity is expired. This could be my own doing as I want to continue the travelling, or maybe I just flunk some interviews. And then the other two is a matter of cost I imagine.

I'm not intent on doing the process the cheapest way possible, just the easiest (if budget options are also available that's great).

I like cities, and the food, and generally, just walking around and seeing amazing Vietnam doing its thing.

I was told that 10 packs was the most I was allowed to bring home so I did and now I’ve almost run out.

I’m trying to figure out if this trip will be doable weather-wise or if it’ll just be exhausting due to heat and humidity. I’m okay with warm weather, but I don’t want it to ruin the experience.

Anyone who’s been there during this time of year can you please share your experience? Is it still worth going, or should I consider shifting my dates?

1jsijzr,reddit,HCMC Apartment Hunt: District 9 vs. Thu Duc for Our Young Family - Need Your Wisdom!,"Hi everyone,

My wife (Vietnamese), our 7-month-old son, and I (English) are looking to buy an apartment in Ho Chi Minh City with a budget of around 4 Billion VND. We've narrowed down our search to a few areas and would really appreciate some advice from those familiar with them.

We've looked at apartments in The Origami and Beverley Solari in District 9 (Grand Park), as well as Opal Garden and Opal Riverside in Thu Duc.

One of the main attractions of District 9 for us is the potential for more space and slightly cleaner air, which we think would be great for our young son as he grows up. However, the distance from the city center is a definite consideration.

In Thu Duc, we liked some of the Opal developments. A significant point is that the apartments in Opal Garden come with a ""pink book"" (sổ hồng), which as a foreigner, gives me a greater sense of security alongside the sales contract. However, we found that Opal Riverside does not currently have pink books.

We're trying to weigh the benefits of more space and potentially better air quality in District 9 against the closer proximity to the city center and the peace of mind of having a pink book in Thu Duc (Opal Garden).
Our main questions are:

 * For families with young children, which district (District 9 or Thu Duc) do you think would be more suitable and why?

 * Does anyone have experience with the Vinhomes Grand Park (The Origami/Beverley Solari) or the Opal developments (Garden/Riverside)? What are your thoughts on these projects and the surrounding areas?

 * Specifically regarding the ""pink book"" situation with Opal Riverside, does anyone have insights into why some new developments might not have them immediately and what the potential risks or timelines could be? Is it something we should be significantly concerned about?

 * Considering our budget of 4 Billion VND, are there any other areas or specific apartment complexes we should be considering that might offer a good balance of space, convenience, and legal security (like having a pink book)?

Any advice or personal experiences you can share would be hugely appreciated as we make this important decision for our family.

##**Tips to quickly find answers for your questions:**

Many of your questions may have been answered since people keep asking the same ones again and again. Here is a quick tip to find the answers for yours.

First, [have a look at our old sticky threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ASticky). A lot of useful information there. A lot of questions have been answered.

You can also use the search feature of Reddit, just like you do with Google.

Another option is to use Google, as Google understands your queries better than Reddit and can return better results.

Go to Google. Add 'site:https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/' next to your queries (without quotes). For example, if I want to find info on eVisa in this subreddit, my query to put in Google is 'eVisa site:https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/'.

1jog3uc,reddit,"Northern Vietnam - Sapa vs Ha Giang, Mai Chau vs Cat Ba","Hi all,

I'm travelling around Vietnam for 1 month in April/May and could really use advice. I'll be flying to Hanoi with my boyfriend and travelling Northern Vietnam with him for 2 weeks, before he flies home from Hanoi Airport. Then I'll be joined by a friend in Hanoi. My friend and I plan to do the 3 day Lan Ha Bay cruise together, before heading to central Vietnam for a week, then flying out of Ho Chi Minh Airport. I'm struggling to decide how to fill the 2 weeks with my boyfriend.

The provisional plan I've drafted is:

* Day 1-3: Hanoi
* Day 3-8: Ha Giang Loop (and travel to Ha Giang)
* Day 8-11: Ninh Binh
* Day 11-14: Mai Chau/Pu Luong OR Cat Ba Island

I'm hesitant to spend more time on Cat Ba Island because I'll be doing the 3 day Lan Ha Bay cruise later that week. However I haven't seen much on Mai Chau/Pu Luong online so I'm not 100% committed to it.  
  
I'm also interested in Sapa and the Phong Nha caves but both seem like they'd involve a lot of additional travel. I think we'd like to keep to 1 major bus journey (6 hour+) as our flight over will be very long.

Lastly - does anyone have any recommendations for decent Vietnam travel guides? Generally everything I've seen so far has been from people who did the classic '2 weeks North to South Vietnam' trip, which doesn't really suit my slightly slower, more Northern focused trip.",2025-03-31 22:27:35,VietNam,VietNam,news,News,[],0,2,2,,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1jog3uc/northern_vietnam_sapa_vs_ha_giang_mai_chau_vs_cat/,arthur-russell
1joc2o9,reddit,Migrants From Pondicherry (French India) to  L'Indochine and Saigon,"Hello, I am tracing my ancestry of my relatives in history. I believe I may have one relative from the early 1900s that made their way from Pondicherry (French India) to L'Indochine (French Indochina) by ship. They were brought by the French government to work in an administrative role. Logic would probably put the person in what is modern day District 3 of Ho Chi Minh City, as this is where Saigon's India Town was located. 

Is their any archive that I could research to better understand the genealogy of something like this?  I have a person's name, when the left Pondicherry, and perhaps when they landed in a coastal are near Saigon... guessing they landed at Cap St Jacques in L'Indochine...modern day Vung Tau, Vietnam. 

If there is anyone that maybe has an idea what archive I could look at, please advise... Either Vietnam or France.

But, to the point: is it pleasant to drive from Da Lat to Nha Trang for a short holiday?  And from there on, upwards to Hoi An?

1jmfofp,reddit,Question about where to find burial of French soldier in Can Tho?,"Hello, I am not sure if this is the right subreddit to ask this but it seems there isn't really any other major Vietnam  related subreddit that I could find with someone that might help. Let alone one having to do with the Indochina War. 

So one of my relatives (Raymond Traumann) was a French soldier in the French Army in the 6e RIC of the 9e DIC. Him and his unit landed in Cochinchine in December 1945 to fight against the rebels (as they called) them and take back Indochina. In January 1946 he was killed in an ambush (it seems in the general Can Tho area) along with an adjutant next to him Luttenhaner, and they were brought back to Can Tho where he was buried in a cemetery next to his comrades where they had a funeral service. This information comes from a [letter typed up](https://wwii-archives.org/index.php/File:144_-_Lettre_du_Commandant_du_Crest_en_Indochine_de_l%27arm%C3%A9e_fran%C3%A7aise_concernant_la_morte_de_Raymond_Traumann_le_23_Janvier_1946.pdf) by his commanding officer commandant du Crest. 

As far as I am aware Raymond's body was never sent back to France and stayed buried in Vietnam. Unfortunately doing while some research I can't find any info about French military personnel buried in Can Tho (maybe the Military Cemetery in Can Tho but it seems that is mainly VC). 

So I was curious if anyone had any information about whether he could still be buried there, moved to somewhere else, or be pointed to somewhere/someone who would know.

I've seen that most people associate Vietnam with coffee, saying there's a coffee shop every block, that Vietnamese drink coffee morning to night everyday. 

But from my experience, we usually only drink coffee in the morning, after that we drink tea. There are also free cold tea stations for drivers on the roads in HCMC. So why is tea not as equally associated to Vietnam as coffee? 

Vietnamese drink tea for centuries, possibly even longer than China. They still do, and also have many tea brands like Phúc Long and Katinat.

4. Estimated pharmacy rider cost and coverage limits—what annual drug-coverage caps are typical?

5. Recommended brokers or agencies in Vietnam who can help compare quotes for these riders.

1k5c8am,reddit,[Travel Advice] Vietnam Trip Late April–May – Where to Be for the Holidays (April 30 & May 1)?,"Hi everyone!

I’m traveling to Vietnam from the end of April until May 13th, and I’m looking for some itinerary advice.

So far, I’ve booked a hotel in Ho Chi Minh City for the first 3 nights, then I’ll be flying to Da Nang on April 28th. From there, I haven’t planned anything yet—open to suggestions!

I’m especially curious about where to be for the April 30th (Reunification Day) and May 1st (Labour Day) holidays. I know these are big national holidays, and I’d love to be somewhere with either unique local celebrations or just a good vibe—whether that’s fireworks, festivals, or even somewhere more chill to avoid the big crowds.

Would it make sense to stay around Da Nang/Hoi An for the holidays, or should I try to be somewhere else (Hue? Hanoi? Somewhere more off-the-beaten-path)? After that, I’ll have around 2 weeks to explore more of the country—north or south, I’m open!

For context, I’m into nature, culture, food, a bit of history, and scenic spots. Not really into clubbing or party scenes, but open to cool local events or experiences.

Any recommendations or travel tips would be really appreciated!

1k4wup8,reddit,Buying lenses with a complicated prescription,"I have albinism so am very blind. I had a recent eye test and have a prescription. Back home my lenses are $350 (incl. blue light filter). 

I walked into a random shop in Hoi An with my prescription and they quoted me $77 and a couple days to make because my prescription is so strong and I need multi focal. 

Posts on here seem to recommend places like Owndays, American Eye Care etc only because they do a better eye test. But I don’t need one of those as I have a prescription - it’s about having lenses made. 

Hoi An is a bit of a tourist trap and I do have the option of heading to Hanoi or HCMC if necessary for this. 

1. Do you think I can still get good quality lenses from any shop? Or do I still need to go somewhere more specialised - and if so, any recs. 

2. What do you think of this price point for a complicated strong prescription?

Just wanting to sense check this as ironically I’m going in blind here haha.

This group aside from 1-2 people are all foreigners, and love Vietnamese cuisine. I’ve been trying to find recommendations online for restaurants suitable for group dining (bonus points if it has a view) but can only find mostly fine dining or international cuisines. Given that it’s all visiting travelers I think the group would best appreciate a restaurant focusing on local foods, but maybe we should stick to that while we explore the city and this dinner could focus on something else that comes highly recommended. This group is also fairly casual, so we’d be fine with a wide variety of environments from casual vibes up to high end and dressy.

Maybe I’m being too picky, so if you have any suggestions that you would take a group of foreign friends for dinner please drop them in this post regardless of any of the requirements I’ve set! I trust local opinions more than anything from a bunch of travel blogs. Especially interested in any quirks, like specialties in their menu, a view, etc. If there’s something unique maybe we’ll try to go there anyways even if it doesn’t fit this dinner!

Has anyone done it this way? Is it worth the extra travel to stay on Cat Ba and take a cruise from there? Or would it be better to just keep it simple and do everything from Hanoi?

Appreciate any tips or personal experiences, thanks in advance!",2025-04-15 12:40:45,VietNam,VietNam,news,News,[],0,1,4,,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1jzqvsg/lan_ha_bay_ha_long_bay_from_cat_ba_vs_hanoi/,h331z

1jzmf4c,reddit,2 weeks in Vietnam,"Me and my partner are heading to Vietnam this May for a 2-week trip. We're flying into Ho Chi Minh City and looking to keep the trip relaxing, with some light cultural bits, great food, and ideally being able to scooter around somewhere chill, not super urban.

We’re not backpacking — looking for mid-range Airbnbs or villas, somewhere peaceful where we can explore beaches, small towns, and eat well without the intensity of moving constantly.

I've already done Sapa, Hanoi, Lào Cai, and Ha Long Bay on a previous trip, so we’re trying to stick to the middle and south of the country this time.

Here's the catch: I’ve searched around this sub and everywhere people seem to be saying things like this.

* Hoi An – “too touristy” ""beaches are gross""
* Phú Quốc – “feels fake/commercial”
* Con Dao – “not the real Vietnam”
* Da Nang – “just a big city with a beach” ...so I’m a bit stuck.

What I *am* looking for is something with the same vibe as Ko Lanta in Thailand — laid-back, scenic, scooterable, not too built up but still with some options. Could be coast or countryside, or even a combo.

Where would you actually recommend, based on what we’re after?

It starts with a really catch whistle that kinda sounds like the chorus, and then the chorus is something along they lines of (from my non viet memory): tiet ai tiet ah something something

Initially I planned to spend 2 days exploring the area and 1 day trip to Ha Long Bay and back for my solo trip. 

But seeing the recent posts about HLB is making me rethink my plans. 

It's one of the more iconic landmarks in Hanoi so it feels like a wasted trip if I don't go. But then again I'm afraid I might not enjoy myself there

Should I still go ahead and at least experience it once? If so what would the best way to go about doing it. I was thinking booking online (any recommendations?) or going there to book by asking my hotel if there are any recommendations. 

I read that the roads are really dangerous? I feel like I will be fine jaywalking and crossing so long I keep a steady pace and wave my hand or something but I'm still afraid that if anything does happen I'll be at a loss on what to do. 

Grab is the way to go right? From the airport to my accommodation? Or should I check with my hotel if there is a pick up service? 

And how much cash should I prepare? I have Youtrip & Revolut which I can both use but I'm guessing some places will not accept cash.

1jx5y9m,reddit,What would you like to see represented in fictional Vietnamese characters/stories?,"Hello! I am an artist from Canada, and I really like having a large, diverse cast of characters.

I have Hoàng Bảo (left) and Võ Xuân (right). While Vo is a decently common last name, I named him after Võ Quý since Xuân has a bird sanctuary and studies zoology and ornithology!

He has a pet crow called Tien (meaning immortal), would this be an odd name to give to a bird?

Bao is very basic lol. He's a classic salaryman.

Firstly, do these characters ""look"" Vietnamese? Would you be happy seeing them in a series or comic? If not, what should I change?

Secondly, (this brings me back to the title of the post) what would you want to see represented through Viet characters? They're still in the very early stages of development so I'm open to everything! Favourite foods, passtimes, family life, etc etc etc

I’ll have 3 full days free in Hanoi this April, and I’d like to explore somewhere outside the city. I was thinking of visiting Mai Chau, Pu Luong, and Ninh Binh. Do you think this itinerary is doable?

Plan:

Day 1: Travel from Hanoi to Mai Chau, do a bit of trekking, and stay overnight in Mai Chau.

Day 2: Head to Pu Luong in the morning, spend the day there, then travel to Ninh Binh in the evening and stay there overnight.

Day 3: Explore Ninh Binh and Tam Coc, then return to Hanoi in the evening. I need to spend the night in Hanoi on this day.

Do you think I can optimize this plan in any way? Should I skip something? I’ve heard Mai Chau and Pu Luong might be quite similar—should I visit just one of them to have a more relaxed trip and combine it with Ninh Binh? What's the best way to move from Hanoi to these locations and to move between these locations?

We have some experience on scooters but not experts.  We have an international drivers permit but not with motorcycle licence.  Is it worth the risk to ride on our own and possibly get fined or would it be smarter to get an easy rider to go with us? What’s the most likely scenario? What’s the worst case scenario? Anyone done it recently?  We are thinking we might get two bikes and a guide as a compromise. They will know the best route and be able to negotiate with police if needed.
