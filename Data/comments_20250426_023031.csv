mn1appx,1jyul4n,reddit,"The man's reaction isn't necessarily endemic to the citizenry here, but the driving habits certainly are.

I've been here since 2014. In 2017 the roads were flooded with cars seemingly overnight, the result of the end of a 100% tax on all vehicles.

There is no way this place properly prepared for any aspect of private car ownership.

There was ample time to:

\- improve the infrastructure to accommodate the increase in private cars

\- develop driver education programs

\- improve traffic ordinances

\- increase public awareness about the dangers of mixing motorbikes and automobiles

BEFORE they lifted this tax.

If I, a puny expat could see all of this coming because I heard the announcements about it years before they actually lifted this tax, why couldn't they?

Instead of doing any of the things mentioned above, they simply opened the floodgates and blamed motorbikes on all of the woes in the big cities.

The majority of automobile drivers simply push their way through anything that gets in their way, and the number of near misses I've had in the past several years are too numerous to count.

I applauded the recent hike in traffic fines, but it hasn't taken long for drivers to figure out that they don't have to become more considerate and respectful drivers. The kinds of behaviors that get people here killed or seriously injured will never be adequately dealt with now that the wave of automobiles has taken over the streets.

The time to do all of that was, again, BEFORE they lifted this tax.",2025-04-14 09:44:33,139,Consistent-Beat-8883,VietNam

First couple of weeks I was here I hadn't got my permanent accommodation I was just in a hotel so I didn't even consider renting or buying a bike until I found permanent accommodation. 
In a week on the back of grabs probably had about four or five near misses. Was when I decided I will just leave the riding up to the locals and just get grabs everywhere.
 In my country we drive on the opposite side of the road, that combined with the crowded skate park like chaos of the roads made me decide to just pull the pin on getting my own transport and use grabs.
 It can be scary especially with the little plastic coated styrofoam lids that passes helmets here.

First OP-Yes shocking and terrible to see what you saw and its hard and will stay with you.

Some notes even though it's a tragedy, you judged the driver by his reaction. You also judged everyone around as indifferent.

As someone who lives here I have found that the people are far from indifferent and care deeply about life and death. During tragedies and around death in particular different cuktures will react in different ways.

You have no idea what happened, you have no idea what people are thinking and are assuming a whole lot. Again terrible situation but the assumptions made are, tbh kinda insulting - you judged an entire country instead of seeking understanding.

mn1ip9m,1jyul4n,reddit,"What you witnessed sounds absolutely heartbreaking — no one should have to see something like that. Your pain and shock are completely valid. But the way the story is framed carries some serious problems that need to be called out. Here’s why:


- One tragedy doesn’t define a whole country.

What happened was awful, but using it to paint all of Vietnam as “dangerous” or “indifferent” is unfair. Accidents like this happen in every country — even the most developed ones - talking from experiences living in 5 different countries from Asia to Europe (Poland, Ireland, etc.). One incident isn’t proof of a national mindset.


- You’ve driven recklessly yourself.

You mention riding motorbikes in Thailand without a license, getting hit, and just “getting up and going.” That’s not exactly a careful or legal approach, so it’s strange to criticize others now for chaotic driving. It comes across as hypocritical.

Also, you mentioned about chaotic traffic in other countries — but you didn’t say those places were lawless or broken. It feels like you’ve already made up your mind about Vietnam being worse, and now you’re just looking for proof


- You assume the worst about people you don’t know.

Saying the man who caused the accident “smiled” and felt nothing is a heavy accusation based on a quick observation. People react to trauma in weird ways — shock, confusion, fear. Smiling doesn’t always mean what you think it does.

The recent movies ""Joker"" with Joaquin Phoenix somehow shows one type of strange trauma reaction


- You're generalizing millions of people.

You say this isn’t about race or people, but then describe Vietnamese drivers as careless, indifferent, and lawless. That is about people — and it’s a sweeping judgment that ignores the complexity of life here.


- You frame normal things as backward.

Pointing out that someone was amazed by your metal bank card and acting like that reflects the whole country feels condescending. Not everyone has access to the same tech or lifestyle — that doesn’t make them lesser.
You're using emotion to make a big, unfair conclusion.

Many foreigners from US and European countries (which are considered as developed) post things about cool tech things developed in Asian countries which are tailor-made for such countries. What do you think about it? Cmon, it's 2025, right?


- Last point, we talk based on evidence. What is the piece of evidence saying that the car driver walk away after killing the woman? Many people asked you, but you just focus on the ""smile"" detail. 


The post is full of emotional weight — which is understandable — but it leads you to a harsh final judgment: that human life here feels disposable. That’s not a fair or accurate takeaway from one awful event.


You’re allowed to feel shaken, and road safety is a real concern in many places. But blaming an entire country and culture for one tragic moment doesn’t help. It just spreads fear, stereotypes, and division.",2025-04-14 11:00:40,14,Significant-Pick4526,VietNam

Yes it looks chaotic but given you are taking a grab my guess is you don’t understand it here nor have done it. It actually has a lot of flow to it and makes sense once you do it long enough. I live in Da Nang and seeing something like that is rare, it will be all over Facebook and any video or picture is shared with tragic responses from others. Not laughing or making light of it. Death isn’t some shut down 10 streets with tape so no one sees. They handle it as a warning and nothing good about it. 

Also, you don’t understand the accountability part.  You cause an accident here you get really screwed. You will pay for everything for that family, you have no insurance worth a damn if you have it at all. You can be jailed if a drop of alcohol is on you or anything reckless.

But my take away is, Hanoians drive super recklessly and stupidly but the accidents they can cause are less fatal, because the roads are more crowded and you have to move slowly. Da Nang has less traffic and reckless driving will cause more serious accidents due to high speed. While in Vietnam, millions of people pass before me daily but I only see very few accident, mostly minor ones, once a month or so, but I saw 2 serious ones in Da Nang in just 3 days, the kind that I only see once a year in Hanoi or HCM city. Reckless drivers are everywhere, but if they are forced to move slowly, they cause less harm. That’s my 2 cents",2025-04-15 22:08:11,2,holymonkay,VietNam

She was just standing near her house watching fireworks and a white guy was wilding in his truck then hit her. The police blamed it on his toxicology and didn’t pursue it as much. 

I myself was hit by a car in the US while crossing the road. While many people stopped to help me. The driver took a long time to get out of their car. 

I’m not defending vietnam’s bad traffic mentality. You’re absolutely right in the sense that lives don’t matter here. People move on even after a bad traffic accidents. I’ve also been hit by the bikes here and the driver stopped to blame it on me who didn’t see him honk. 

I think it is couple with drivers who drive their car like a bike. Bike drivers going opposite ways and not being fined. The infrastructure is set up poorly. Weird intersection for sure fire way to get into accidents. Bad management from the police. 

Rest assured thou if it was indeed the guy’s fault he will be charged. There are many articles and posts of driver being charged and license get taken away.

2. I dont know if the car driver was wrong or the woman was wrong. But alot of people forget to turn on their brain when riding or driving. Mostly motorcycles rider does not even know traffic laws, reckless, etc. In my perspective, its nature selection. You ride stupid and you died because of your fault is completely understandable.

3. Roads are unsafe. Pot holes, no or weak road lights, pedestrian, dogs, people from small alleys can come out anytime. The way they designed the city is fucked

4. Shit will get worse. In Vietnam there is no proper training (since most people either paid for their license or forget right after they got their license), people does not know the basic of traffic laws, there is no lane, people not scare of new law call “nghi dinh 168” which increases the fines.

Vietnamese spend those US dollars on products from neighbouring countries, whether manufacturers like China,services and raw material exporters like Australia etc. Those countries are closer to Vietnam and logical trade partners.


Those countries now have spare US dolalrs they need to do something with. They either hold it as reserve currency, which increases the value of the US dollar, or they spend it on US goods and services, which flows back into the US. Either way the trade with Vietnam is returned.

Vietnam’s Trade & Investment Barriers
Non-Tariff Barriers

•	Import Bans: Restrictions on secondhand goods, vehicle parts, IT products, and cultural items.

•	Customs Delays: WTO-compliant tax separation adopted, but disputes still cause slow processing.

•	Pharmaceuticals & Medical Devices: Licensing hurdles; drug approvals extended to Dec 31, 2024, and medical device licenses to June 30, 2025.

•	Ethanol Policy: U.S. pushing for E10 expansion; Vietnam limits ethanol to 5% in one fuel grade.

Trade Barriers

•	Labeling Rules: Decree 111/2021 creates compliance issues.

•	ICT Testing: Local testing requirements reject international reports, increasing costs.

•	GMO Approvals: Resumed in 2024 with three new corn hybrids.

•	Food Safety: Conflicting interpretations of Decree 15; under review until 2025.

•	Meat & Poultry: Slow facility approvals, offal ban lifted but no new U.S. export sites since 2013.

•	Government Procurement: Vietnam favors domestic suppliers, is not a WTO procurement member.

Intellectual Property (IP) & Service Barriers

•	Weak IP Protection: Vietnam remains on U.S. Special 301 Watch List (2024); piracy and counterfeiting persist.

•	Audiovisual Services: Decree 71/2022 requires local presence for OTT streaming; strict film content rules.

•	Financial Services: Foreign ownership in banks capped at 30%; 2024 law tightens restrictions further.

•	Electronic Payments: NAPAS monopoly limits competition for international providers.

Digital Trade & E-Commerce Barriers

•	Cybersecurity & Data Localization:

o	2018 Cybersecurity Law mandates local data storage.

o	Decree 53 (2022) & pending regulations create uncertainty.

•	Internet Restrictions: State-controlled ISPs regulate content; Decree 147 (2024) expands control over cloud services.

•	Personal Data Protection:

o	Decree 13 (2023) restricts cross-border data flows.

o	2024 National Data Law adds security-related reporting for data transfers.

•	Electronic Transactions: 2023 law lacks clarity on compliance; Decree 48 (2024) excludes foreign digital signature providers.

Investment Restrictions

•	Decree 31 (2021):

o	Bans foreign investment in 25 sectors.

o	Restricts 58 sectors (e.g., banking, aviation, logistics) via ownership caps & joint ventures.

o	Prime Minister approval required for key projects (e.g., oil & gas, casinos).

•	Telecommunications Law (2023):

o	Limits foreign ownership in network-based services.

o	Expands regulations to data centers & cloud computing.

o	Decree 163 (2024): Adds compliance rules for foreign firms (data localization, security).

Environmental & Transparency Barriers

•	Illegal Timber Trade:

o	2021 Timber Agreement: Vietnam committed to eliminating illegal wood sourcing.

o	U.S. continues enforcement monitoring.

•	Regulatory Transparency Issues: 

Overlapping agency mandates create policy uncertainty.

Export Taxes (Decree 26, 2023)

•	1% - 40% tax on resource-based products (e.g., wood, coal, crude oil, metals).

•	Applied when resource costs exceed 51% of product value.",2025-04-03 12:21:17,4,dausone,VietNam

Outrage-driven ad revenue and the death of true journalism it has caused. Got it. I hate unregulated capitalism, dammit.

Can we also just talk about how dumb the Trump Administration is for pulling this stunt? Not only is their math blatantly wrong. It’s wrong in a predictable, no, calculable, way. One that allows us to point at them and show them for the fools they are. I bet they asked an AI model to draw this whole tariff plan up with the numbers and just assumed it got things right. For all we know it did and it was just that the prompt they gave was flawed because, ya know, they’re all dumbasses over there in that Whit House cabinet.

The math that they either chose to use or went with per an AI model’s suggestion also makes it so that the countries that produce disproportionately more for us than we them will tend to be punished more greatly. Just dandy. 

Watch as Trump walks this back over the coming days and makes a big fucking show of it. He’s already started to with Vietnam who called him up to negotiate with the great stupid US president.

Honestly, the biggest mindfuck is trying to discern whether they are actually this stupid or if they’re stupid actions are just feigned stupidity that is meant to act as one massive constant fucking red herring for who is controlling / paying them, or if they are just that fucking stupid themselves and that is why whoever is controlling them—be they the billionaire oligarchs of the world or Putin more specifically—use them because it still works as a massive distraction from the class war that rages on in Cold War fashion with zero bullets and bombs.",2025-04-05 06:11:02,1,mgwair11,VietNam

Growing up I remember being ashamed to be Asian, wanting to fit in with the other Americans. I remember my first online girlfriend on RuneScape I told her I was white and looked like Eminem lol.

In high school I got bullied and some girl asked me if I ate dogs. Shit was rough for an Asian kid. I started to get more pride in 2010 when Big Bang got big and kpop started to get more popular. Then going to the Asian area hanging out there helped a lot too.

Things didn't really fall into place into my early to mid 20s. I had lost my job and my cousin told me if I wanted to go back to Vietnam for a month. Why not I had nothing to lose. As a kid I thought Vietnam was ghetto and smelly especially that bridge near the pogoda on the way to D3/D1.

Now returning to Vietnam as an adult who hasn't been back since he was 10 was mind blowing. Vietnam was developing fast in 2016. I was shocked how much has changed. I had fallen in love with the place and in a sense found myself. I loved it so much after 30 days, I called my mom and told her I wanted to stay in Vietnam as an English teacher. Of course she was worried and had every right to be. Long story short I stayed in Vietnam until covid got me stuck in the States in 2020.

It's healing to come back home as a Viet Kieu. Feels like a home from home. Made me proud of our heritage, culture, food etc. I would say if you're living in a Western country and feel like something is missing in your life maybe you need to return to Vietnam. Now I'm the majority and blend right in if I don't say a word. It's rough be ostracized living in the West as an Asian man TBH.

moqzuxf,1k6kfm8,reddit,"Being faced with racism, people either get defensive about their ethnicity or they start hating it. Sometimes something inbetween.

Then there was a time, where I was so proud of being Vietnamese, I made it all about myself. You know, making self-deprecating Asian jokes about yourself or how Vietnamese are.

Anyway, I grew out of all these phases and I'm glad you were also able to reconnect with being Vietnamese. It's regrettable that countries like Germany are still quite racist. Then again, I feel like that most countries in Europe are. Some more than others. Vietnamese are interesting people and when I listen to my parents or relatives story, all I can feel is deep admiration and respect for indomitable human spirit and resilience.

mosptn0,1k6kfm8,reddit,"Was geht! Born and raised in Germany Vietnamese here too. But lived in VN in my elementary school period and then came back.

Had the same experiences as you too but I was proud of my country all the way from small until now despite all these racist remarks those whites made. My pride got me into alot of trouble and fights. I was always seen as the evil guy even though they were the ones that teased me or were the racists ones. Teachers and parents were always siding them and said I should apologize but I never did, so I faced alot of consequences. Friends turned on me, had to switch schools, had little to none friends because I was living more outside in the country where all the rednecks and farmers are so I think racism was bit extremer and tolerated by others in my case. My father told me since I was small that we’re all ants and nothings in this world but I always refused.

Until now I still face racism against asians on the regular in public. I often hear racist small talks when they see me, assuming that I don‘t know German. Guess what? I came to them and spoke fluently German into their face and told them to fuck off. This is getting me into alot of trouble or fights but I think someone has to stand up and do something against it. Otherwise it gets tolerated and normalized which it is already.

My pride is maybe because of the reason that asians in foreign (western) countries are seen as very subordinate and harmless because we’re compared to others as very respectful and as no troublemakers. So people don’t even take us serious in so many ways. 

If you made racist remarks against black people or muslims everyone is suddenly shocked and offended but if it’s racist remarks against asians it’s all fun, just jokes and everyone laughing. 

My anger was caused due to so many incidents that happened to my family. My grandma back in the days when she went shopping alone, she was teased by teenagers that made racist remarks about her, kicked her, stole her stuff. She came home and was so angry and told that she doesn’t want to live in Germany anymore. My father got scammed by a GROWN married couple and nobody took him serious even the police. I could tell so many more and it wouldn’t stop. 

It’s not the kids, it’s the mentality how asians are seen in the public. They see us as a group that obeys everything so they do everything they want because they know we won’t do anything about it!

Someone’s gotta stand up first and say stop so they can’t play with us!

I hope every vietnamese in foreign countries start to do something against it and not just silently obey and then complain afterwards with vietnamese fellows. We have to show that it’s not okay! 


As someone who has lived in Vietnam in elementary school and travel regularly back to VN. I can say that VN has its bad sides, but does every other country has that too? In the end it comes to your preference and standards. For example me: I love the smell of gasoline/pollution, I can live with lower standards, I love swimming through traffic, I love vietnamese entrepreneurship. This sounds very odd but some people can’t even imagine living in such surroundings and be happy, prefer clean western standards, climate, etc.

Just to be funny of coarse but since you are reinforced by laughter amongst your friends you think it’s cool. So the jokes get more and more mean!  Not only Asian kids all kids faces the same thing. If you are shy or quiet you thin to be the ones the others focus on. 
I am Vietnamese and came over when I was 7yrs old. Didn’t speak the language and even my gym teacher used to call me “Charlie”! I guess nickname for Asian kid. But I never let all that bother me. I became one of those that made fun of others. Even while not knowing the language I didn’t let people bully me. So it’s all about the individual if you let people bully you that’s what will happen. Vietnamese people are resilient and adaptable we can survive anywhere and do well. I have always been proud of my culture. I was lucky enough to be able to see my parents 37 years after I left Vietnam. My aunts and uncle raised me. I owe everything to them. I was a refugee boat kid. I lived on an island in Indonesia for 8 months. Should have been dead from all the malaria. But god or Buddha I’m pretty sure both had to be there to save me. So for being alive I knew there is a purpose for me getting to live while many other kids around my aged died. Which got me to think I’m living on borrowed time. I must have been saved for a reason. So I have been living the best way I know how. To make my aunts and uncle proud. Now days I get to visit my parents along with my sister often in Vietnam. Which got me to truly love and respect Vietnam culture. Therefore I created a coffee brand called Heritage1857. Which celebrates the heritage of Vietnamese coffee drinking culture and the coffee trees were planted in 1857. So heritage 1857 embodies the love of my aunts and uncles that raised me. Kept me from harm. The love from my parents and sister now in Vietnam. I want American market to truly understand how rich and delicious the coffee from Vietnam truly is. I want to show American market we may come from a small country but we are here to do extraordinary things!! I’m very proud to me born Vietnamese now being American citizen.

My family didn’t allow me to follow my passion (computer science) in fear that I would become gay (lol I’m straight as can be). They made me go learn how to make paper flowers as a trade lmao. 

They also abused me physically and emotionally for 17 years. I was not provided with adequate medical care. Public beatings were just another regular day. They berated me for everything under the Sun. I was the punching bag of everyone - my parents, aunts, uncles, grandparents - because I was a girl, darker skinned, and not as pretty. In short, I would not become a desirable wife. 

Only when I moved to the West that I started learning self worth. Took roughly another 15 years to undo the damages Vietnam has done to me. 

So I guess good for you. But you can’t pay me to live in vietnam ever again. I couldn’t even come back there for a visit let alone to live there.",2025-04-25 03:35:55,2,MiaMiaPP,VietNam

moqugfs,1k6kfm8,reddit,"I used to be proud of being Vietnamese. You know, the history books of the education system here really do a good job. Then I started travelling abroad and hated being Vietnamese. When I'm in other countries, I often said I'm Korean or Chinese when I'm abroad. Then I grew up more and more, and I don't hate or don't like being Vietnamese at all. I just don't care, it's not important, and it's not my choice. It's one of the card I was dealt, and how to play it is my only choice now. Although I had a chance to live in another country, I choose to stay in Vietnam, just rational thinking based on my profession, and try to play my cards to my best ability.  
By the way, I often find it strange when people are proud of being something, like being gay, or being black, or in this case, being Vietnamese. I thought the word ""proud"" is for something that you achieve, for your accomplishment, for something you pour sweat and blood in to get... not for something you're just... born with. It's like when someone say they're proud of being rich, but they just end up having rich parents...",2025-04-24 06:13:32,5,CMDR_Lina_Inv,VietNam

Germany is not like America a melting pot of cultures. So it took longer.

If a flight is delayed for 5 hours or longer, Vietjet offers a refund. Additionally, Vietjet may provide non-refundable compensation as per regulations.

Of the last 6 times I flew with them, VietJet somehow managed to be late 5 times. I have ZERO idea how they even did this. Meanwhile I've flown with Vietnam Airlines, Vietravel Airlines and also Thai AirAsia and they've been pretty good, with flights running mostly on time and delays being minor (usually 5-20min, not VJ's hours). 

  I'm also boycotting them for the odd personal reason of them screwing me around by letting me take my long freedive fins as carry-on in a soft case during a trip to Phuket (and yes, I queried it with the main customer service people, check-in desk and the gate staff) only to then argue on the return journey that they should be checked into the hold and I'd have to pay some stupid amount for the pleasure, something like 2M Dong. I argued that I'd already got them there as carry-on, I'd already queried all of this with the Vietjet CS and check-in when I'd flown out and that if they wanted me to check them in, they could give me $350 equivalent in Dong for it, because that would be the cost of the replacements if they got damaged.

mkboek9,1jmfzdt,reddit,"I'm Canadian. When I was a kid I went to a New Years dinner in the US at a Chinese restaurant with my fathers friend, a lawyer, and his family. 

The lawyer got a little drunk, started reciting lines from Apocalypse Now at full volume because the waitress was from Vietnam. He had a good 20 second ballad going. It ended with him yelling ""I was in NAM!"" and then slammed his face down into a plate of Chow Mein. (he had never been to asia at this point) 

Everybody knew who he was (small town) , and they knew you cant stop him once he gets into character. 

30 years later he and his wife travelled to ""Nam"" and he said it was quite a nice place, great people. I've been there a dozen times myself... 

But yea, I travel quite a bit for work and the amount of people that play youtube vids at full volume with no headphones on the plane, in the lounge, is astonishing. No regard for other people.

I heard one of those dipshits explaining to our guide that americans did not bomb their temples, and the bomb craters were stemming from the Japanese…

What a buffoon.

One of the guys in a group tour demanded to be dropped off first in the evening, because „he waited long in the morning“. We all waited 15min longer because someone showed up late.
It ended by our tour guide organizing a taxi on the fly, paying for the taxi by himself, just to end this horrible scene and drop that american sausage off early. I was so sorry for our guide, i also tipped him later enough to cover the taxi.

Other examples of the people of „gods greatest nation“ are just loud, taking photos in the temple or wearing unappropriate clothing.

Americans especially should be forced to pay for a thorough application process before being even considered setting a foot on to your wonderful country.

mlw0c2x,1jtpr3l,reddit,"PETER NAVARRO: The reality here is that institutionally, the international trade system is designed to cheat us—they have systematically higher tariffs on us, but far more importantly, it’s the nontariff cheating. It’s the VAT taxes, it’s the currency manipulation, the dumping, the export subsidies, the fake standards that keep our agricultural products out and keep our cars out of Japan—it’s all these things that these foreign countries do that are designed explicitly to cheat us and are sanctioned by the World Trade Organization too. President Trump says, “No more—no mas—ain’t happening on his watch.” And that’s where we’re heading—towards a strong America that makes things again.

FOX NEWS: What you’re talking about here at home is a deindustrialization. You’re talking about reprivatization, which is crucial and essential not only to our future but also to national security. When you bring up the nontariff barrier, there was a lot of conversation about how the reciprocal tariff formula was calculated, and you mentioned those nontariff barriers were taken into account. You’ve got a country like China that’s coming back and saying, “We’re going to impose a reciprocal tariff,” but other countries—for example, Vietnam—saying, “We’re going to take our tariff down too.” Everybody wants to know what the president is going to do—is he going to take Vietnam’s tariff down to zero, or because of those nontariff barriers, does something stay on?

PETER NAVARRO: Jackie, I’m so glad you asked that question because Vietnam is the poster child for the nontariff cheating—let me walk you through that. We were on about a $123 billion trade deficit with Vietnam—if you simply lowered our tariffs and they lowered our tariffs to zero, we’d still run about a $120 billion trade deficit with Vietnam. The problem is all of the nontariff cheating that they do—let me walk you through some of the things they do.

The first biggest problem is that Vietnam is essentially a colony of communist China—China uses Vietnam to transship to evade the tariffs. How does that work? Vietnam sells us $15 for every $1 we sell them—and about $5 of that is just Chinese product that comes into Vietnam—they slap a “Made in Vietnam” label on it and send it here to evade the tariffs. But Vietnam is also the biggest dumper and biggest user of export subsidies—I don’t know if you saw the clip of that beautiful Louisiana shrimp guy saying, “Hey, God bless Donald Trump for protecting us”—do you know who he’s protecting them from? Vietnam.

We know they do export subsidies because at the Department of Commerce—that’s the one that slaps on the anti-dumping countervailing duties—so they do that. And then they have the VAT tax—they have a 10% VAT tax—they use some of those phoney standards. The sum and substance of all this, Jackie—it’s like every country around the world cheats us—but it’s like fingerprints—they all do it in different ways—it all comes down to the nontariff cheating.

It was interesting to hear Elon Musk at the beginning talk about a zero-tariff zone with Europe—he doesn’t understand that. And the thing that’s, I think, important about Elon to understand—he sells cars—that’s what he does. If you look, for example, at the Tesla factories in Texas, they’re assembly plants, and they get a lot of their content from China, Mexico, Japan, and Taiwan, and elsewhere—what President Trump wants to do is turn Detroit back into Detroit instead of having Detroit in Mexico now like they have it.

The guy who—Brian, that Liberation Day ceremony almost stole the show from the boss, the UAW worker. He pointed to all those factories in Detroit that can be rapidly filled up—we can’t just be an assembly nation—BMW with German engines—

FOX NEWS: We need to manufacture, and we need to assemble—if I can just circle back to Vietnam, does that mean the tariff stays?

PETER NAVARRO: Sure—yes, I mean, look, here’s the thing—this is not a negotiation—this is a national emergency based on a trade deficit that’s gotten out of control because of cheating. We’re always willing to listen—that’s what Donald Trump does best.

But I want to just say to the world here—if you want to come and talk to us, don’t say you want to lower the tariffs and be done with it—it’s the nontariff cheating. Stop manipulating your currency, stop dumping stuff in—Europe, take your 19% VAT tax down to zero—don’t put these fake agricultural standards that keep out our pork and our dairy and our chickens—and Vietnam, don’t dump shrimp into our markets and put the good people of Louisiana on our coast out of work. This is what people have to understand—it’s the nontariff cheating that matters the most.",2025-04-07 16:45:52,42,Resident-Pen5451,VietNam

mlduups,1jr4jp4,reddit,That’s kind of the point. VN tariffs are so outrageously high on US goods that it costs double the price to VN consumers to buy those US goods. VN businesses don’t import US goods because their people can’t afford them. The US could sell more to VN if they eliminated/reduced their tariffs.

VN always use the pretext ""a low-level developing country and is affected by effects of Vietnam war and embargo"" to buy time and avoid making changes until now. Other countries (Korea, Japan) were affected by war in much larger scale but they did not whine but develop their enonomy with small US aid and their domestic resources. Within 25-30 years, Japan and Korea became the Asian super power with their head high while many generation of VN leaders keep begging for non-refundable ODA, loans from financial institutions, Japan, EU with no esteem.

Saying you only want knowledge workers or skilled workers says you don't value manual labor or service industry jobs. Sorry but until robots build your houses or harvest your food or provide retail or cleaning services , people need to do those jobs so everyone can enjoy life. AND there is nothing wrong with those jobs. They provide value, they provide tax revenue, they are staffed by people that raise families, take care of their own homes, raise kids that go to school and learn, attend church and sports along side your children and are a net positive to society.  A society has labor for all types and their is value in all honest labor.

Those hiring illegal labor are the problem and are worse than those doing the honest labor illegally 

You can say the problem is illegal immigration, but the data does not show it. The truth does not match your story, illegal workers are NOT a drain on resources. They provide services for less benefit, the people hiring them are the ones benefiting more and draining resources.

I want a society where we educate our people to do all jobs we need; service, tech, trades, knowledge, health, science. There is a place for everyone. And if we have a truly superior education system we should not have to import jobs that are the most valuable; if we can have immigrants fill the roles that are necessary but less productive that is great for everyone; then their children can benefit from the education we provide. 

 Why do you want to export education and training to other nations and leave the necessary lower skill jobs for citizens?

It's no different than trade the past 50 years we import low cost raws or finished items (flat steel and socks) and we export Software, designs, airplanes and industrial equipment.  We import low value low margin goods and export high value high margin goods

From your other comment, I read that you are from the States. I also live in the States right now and book Uber regularly every night. I don’t even dare to jump into a random car at the airport in the States that claims to be from Uber or any taxi car.

It's a good lesson for you so when you go back to the US you won’t get tricked by simple scams like these. Thailand used to be scam center of southeast Asia so I think the reason why you are so mad about this type of scam is because Vietnam does not grant visa-free for those from the US.

mokdfcx,1k5kiz4,reddit,"Masan is the worst company when it comes to malicious campaigns to kill its competition

- Search 3MCPD for the scandal it created to kill other soy sauce brands.

- ""Fish sauce with Arsen"" or ""Nước mắm có chứa thạch tín"" is also the rumor they made to kill traditional fish sause so they can sell their chemically-produced fish sauce

- ""Chiến dịch hạt nêm 2010"" for seasoning.

- ""Chiến dịch mì gói 2011"" for instant noodles.

- ""Chiến dịch cà phê 2012"" with Vinacafe.

Basically this company is using the same dirty trick every time they wanna sell something of their own: by creating shocking rumors that the product on the market has chemical/health risk and then they will introduce the product that is clean of those problems. The rumors tend to kill their competitions during spreading process. This has been repeatedly used for a long time. Masan is not a company with good moral.

Oh, and in 2019, Japan recalled 18,000 bottles of Chinsu chili sauce imported from Vietnam due to the presence of sodium benzoate, a preservative banned in Japan but still legal under Vietnamese food safety regulations. The incident raised concerns about differing international food standards and the responsibilities of exporters. Masan, the producer, stated that the sauce was made for the domestic market and was not intended for export.

But I was stubborn. I only got in cram schools to learn subjects I like. I recall not attending my 12 grade homeroom teacher's night class (in Chemistry). She did my grade badly, even though I was a part of the national physics team (meaning all my grades were above 8/10). I was disqualified because my grade in chemistry was no longer above the requirement at that time. I still hate that woman my entire life. Then I realized some of my classmates bought grades from that woman. That woman never taught anything in class. She spent 30 minutes talking about bs things like her kids, stories about things that wasn't related to the subject. Then spent 15 mins left to SPEED RUN THE WHOLE CHAPTER!!! I reported to the Principal, guess what? I was treated like a crazy kid. Get isolated and bullied by those classmates

They DON'T teach anything in classes. EVERYTHING IS IN THEIR F NIGHT CLASSES!

They will (possibly) tell you what's on the tests if you attend their little night classes. That's why the parents force their kids to study like fucking bull on the field.

My understanding is that teachers in public schools were holding classes in the evening. This isn't about private study sessions, or language centers, or any of that stuff.

They are basically telling public teachers that you should be sticking to reasonable school hours.

But, now the teacher can just tell parents ""we are having a private study session tomorrow evening"" and they will probably still send their kids. 

Truth is, nothing about this situation is really going to change without a culture change from parents. I work with 7 year olds who legitimately explain that they have no free time during the week.

mnqqzcn,1k15u5p,reddit,"As a university student who's a future teacher and is teaching part-time in VN, I want to share my view. When I was still in school, I studied from early morning (around 7:00) to around 17:00 in the afternoon. That's only school. Afterwards, like other kids, I took ""extra classes"" because it was almost required in order to catch up. Classes in school were (& are) pretty crowded, so teachers typically couldn't resolve every problem or question of the students, given the amount of time and knowledge. Imo, the amount of knowledge I had to learn was a lot for the amount of time I spent in school even though I had to study from morning to afternoon in some grades. Therefore, I felt like I couldn't absorb everything in class -> take extra classes for more practice. This is not counting the instances where bad teachers make students attend their tutoring lessons by deliberately giving us a hard time getting good marks vs practically revealing the questions before a test for those who did attend (yeah that actually happens). Some things to note: a lot of teachers don't get really good salary from public schools, at least according to my knowledge, and these extra classes are a big part of their total income (main source of income for some, even).

Anyways, that's the context. Now, with the existence of stricter laws regarding extra classes, what happens? For students, seemingly, they have more free time without extra classes. At first glance, I love this change as it allows them to spend more time with their family or on extra-curricular activities or more, which is something I wish I could do more during my school years. However, they are still required to study roughly the same amount of knowledge in school despite some changes to the curriculum recently. I know that because I've tutored a few students who have shared quite a bit of their student life with me. Teachers, on the other hand, lose a lot of their income from this. After some previous changes to the law, a lot of teachers that I know lost whole classes of students, which is equal to losing lots of income. Personally, I want the education system to change more in terms of curriculum, perhaps a more complete overhaul. This should ensure that the difficulty of knowledge is appropriate for students to not HAVE to take extra classes, but only optional. In the current state, schoolwork may still be too hard to manage without tutoring for a large number of students. Second, for teachers, something needs to be done about their salaries to compensate for the absence of extra classes. Otherwise, people will be discouraged from teaching as a whole. Maybe I got more to say, but those are my OPINIONS for now.",2025-04-18 11:36:53,1,Technicqlly,VietNam

My cousin's used to go through my things when i was visiting and steal from me even when they could have just asked me like a normal person. We are a low income household and depend on food banks and government assistance. He never poured into me and my sibling except for times we traveled to vietnam because he was sending everything back to them just for them to burn him on his deathbed and just kinda taught me that i had to work for what i own with no assistance from family. 
My cousins in Vietnam are set and live comfortably and able to pursue education or work knowing they have a permanent home. And me and my sibling have had to face setbacks in education and stability throughout our lives. Every time i did visit them they were nationalistic and i felt really insecure that i wasn't as fluent in vietnamese because it limited harder concepts i could express, but there was a very clear sensation i felt being an ""other"" with them as a viet kieu, even in the country.

mkzt5s6,1jow25n,reddit,"I really dislike some of the discourse here. The American War / Vietnam War ended only 50 years ago.  
  
There are people living in both overseas and in Vietnam that remember the war well and teach their children about it. The war hasn’t stopped in some places in Vietnam since they are still digging out land mines and there are still so many people born with birth defects from the left over napalm and agent orange in the water and environment. Some of the south Vietnamese that stayed in Vietnam suffered greatly after the war. The entire country was devastated.  Rebuilding took a very long time and a heavy toll.   The last 20 years has been amazing as Vietnam modernized very quickly after opening up and getting more aid from countries around the world. 
  
Life was not easy for overseas Vietnamese having lost their homes and needed to rebuild among a lot of racism, being put in the worst ghettos and not getting enough aid in France, US, and elsewhere. Some were able to contact their family back in Vietnam, but many could not.  Yes, some of them had money and were able to lead successful businesses rebuilding in another country or had relatives that left earlier who could provide support.  
   
Then the children of the current generation barely know the horrors of war are spouting grievances they did not witness first hand and barely learned from their parents or grandparents.

mmz95pn,1jy51y8,reddit,"Yes, and it's like that almost all the time. To summarise the reasons

- theyve upped the number of flights to make $$$$ for the few
- they've shadow banned anybody who doesn't have a ""VIP"" pass from using the express check in. You can figure out the meaning of VIP. So disabled, small children, elderly all have to do the big queue without these passes.
- they don't have an up to date IT system, instead they use something from the days of windows XP. Immigration is slow. They are too ""proud"" to use a good non Vietnamese system
- they don't have enough staff. Only connected people can do this job and as it's a uniformed floor job it's mostly moronic nepo nieces and nephews. 
- they don't have enough space to expand for more equipment for security checks etc.
-They won't use segregated queues for immigration. I've never seen any other country not have this or snaking lines. Idiotic!!!


For some reason the two main airports here are terribly run hell holes that could be fixed in 12 months with a bit of brain power but they choose not to.

mouujqj,1k42flc,reddit,"If there's competition for recklessness I think Vietnamese would be a strong candidate

Not that they'll do well in a proper sporting competition with some degree of risks, no. You would not find a motor-racing champion from Vietnam in your life time. But a competition for risky behavior in the mold of Jackass movies, yes, we'd produce some noteworthy competitors :)

Don't get me wrong, this is not all bad. In wars, it can be advantageous to have soldiers who don't mind risking their life. But in peace time, yeah sometimes it can be just a tad bit nerve-wracking, especially if you're sitting at a keyboard looking at a clip.

(While you're actually on the bike zipping through the streets though, it can feel safer than expected. I know this can be hard to believe, but how you feel on the bike is different from how you feel at home lying in bed watching the same bike ride from the rider's point of view. This happens at every speed, not just the speed in the clip. Do it and you'll know what I mean.

There is something magical about the place that makes you miss it. The people, the culture, the chaotic fun, and the food all made it a wonderful trip. The thought of leaving the country as the trip was coming to an end was so heartbreaking. While my other friends who came with me are busy planning to visit some other country for the next (like a checklist kinda thing), I, on the other hand, am planning to come back to VN. We just explored the tip of the iceberg, and VN has so much to offer.

People ask me why do you wanna go back to the same country. All I could up with as a response is, ""It just wasn't enough.""

ml5f3ru,1jq7sb9,reddit,"I have a masters degree in economics and business administration, for what its worth. There is a lot of misinformation or ignorance about tariffs, that's why my lengthy reply:

Short version:
Dont worry this isnt good but it's not as huge as it sounds, tariffs are on CUSTOMS VALUE, not retail value meaning that the cost of these tariffs aren't going to cut into the revenue THAT much, especially since some of the tariff cost will get forwarded to American customers. Some products will be hit hard but those generally don't offer that many jobs Anyway. In the end, vietnam has the opportunity to trade with other markets as those also will get tariffs by usa. Being less dependent on the USA is a good thing. 

Long version;

It won't ruin the entire economy. Some % the companies will absorb, some % will be passed on to the consumer. This is temporary. Even if it lasts for years, Trump will be gone in 3.7 years. And probably a Democrat will be elected next to fix the horrid mess trump will leave behind and abandoned these foolish measures.

Also don't forget the usa already has tariffs on these goods. Example on clothing the tariff is already around 19%, so that's still going to be increased but it's not from 0 to 46. (NOTE: doesn't apply if it's an extra blanket tariff)

Anyway heres more info about a tariff;

A t-shirt on sale for 10 dollar in USA doesn't mean the company needs to pay a 46% tariff on 10 dollar, the value of an imported t-shirt (also called the customs value) is more like 1 or 2 dollar. So a tariff of 46% could be 46-92 cents. So a 10 dollar tshirt will cost 10.50 or 11. There will be a smaller demand as that always happens when price goes up, but won't be a lot as clothing is a necessity. Same applies to much of its textiles and lesser extend the shoes. Other products like tech etc will have less big margins so will hurt a bit more but American households will feel that pain more and the companies can look to try to sell to others, worst case they move part of production and vietnam loses some jobs, but many of those companies just came to vietnam after heavy investments. So we will need to wait an see

Of course on a national scale that's big numbers, but on the micro level it's being blown a bit out of proportion. And consumers are on a micro level.

For (European) cars and raw materials the issue is much bigger as a car or raw materials being imported already has close to the sale value and profit margins aren't that big. But most of what vietnam exports isn't high cost. So don't worry. 

Also, the USA is tariffing most of the world, everyone will be looking for new/more markets. So, Vietnam can do the one thing which is the biggest asset you can have in business-> a diversified market/portfolio (as in, less dependency on USA, trade more with EU, China, Africa, ...) 

In the end, this only damages the USA long-term, as they lose standing and trade relations, and their consumers will pay more for EVERYTHING. The US doesn't have enough workers to take back all that production. He must know this due to his team of advisors. So, one must wonder wtf are Republicans trying to do over there. (Putting on my conspiracy hat) Working for Putin or Xi seems doubtful, my guess is just they want to destabilize the USA to get more power. Basically a conservative coup of the nation.

The islands were overcrowded. Hang Luon was nice but we were not given enough time to kayak. Ti Top we were there for way too long, there was nothing to do other than walk up a hill or swim in the polluted waters. Hang Sung Sot took way longer than necessary and felt claustrophobic due to queues. 

The views were pretty but due to the smog there was no sky or sun. Everything was grey. We were at Tràng An the day before and the scenery was way more lush and the air much fresher. I would definitely consider the Ninh Binh area again.

There’s a saying: “prosperity brings manners” only when people have money can they afford to care about appearances. It’s the same with the environment. If I want to do something meaningful for the planet, I need money and technology. But to get that, I have to work and make money first, and that just feeds into the cycle.

There is an acoustical as well as a neurological explanation. 

Nh doesnt have a natural spelling in English or most western languages. Its more often happening in words like ""inhale"", ""inhabitable"", ""unholy"", ""unhinged""... Where as the connection between the letters is in different syllables. 

Hn in words however do sound in a similar way banh is pronounced... Like German ""Bahn"", ""Wahn"", ""erwähnen"", ""ahnen""... 

I have a similar letter combo in my first name, where I can literally stand there spelling my name and watch German natives switch up two letters right away. Almost never fails to happen. 

Now add, how our brain works when reading, and you'll understand, why our brain picks up hn instead of nh. Its called typoglycemia

One of the reasons countries like Vietnam were hit hard by the tariffs is due to geopolitics. Vietnam is still flirting with both China and the US. United States is jealous of people who court China so heavily, and the tariffs are also there to show Vietnam they will not tolerate it.

I was rammed at a pedestrian crossing by a motorbike in Da Nang. I had a bicycle and I was not riding it. There was a lot of traffic, cars were really slow. A stupid driver thought it is ok to overtake all the cars on the right side in proximity of the pedestrian crossing, without looking if someone is crossing the street. She rammed me.

morrmq6,1k6fnj0,reddit,"For me, comparing Japan and Vietnam because they “have the same shape” is a bit like comparing a sword and a machete because they are both sharp.

Japan is an island, folded, ultra homogeneous, which has developed impressive resilience after natural and human disasters (including two atomic bombs and a nuclear incident).
Japan cuts into silence: insular, homogeneous, disciplined, resilient.

Vietnam is a continental people, despite its significant maritime dimension, forged by the fight against French colonization, and the war against the United States.
Vietnam splits in the tumult: continental, rebellious, forged in resistance.
Two weapons, two rhythms, two stories.
No comparison holds if we forget the substance

And as I speak from the point of view of a French woman, I omit all the internal stories and those with neighbors like China, well because we don't talk about it here and therefore I don't know it well and I would be afraid of saying stupid things.

As an American citizen, what would you think? In Vietnam, if people saw their national flag being disrespected like that, they would be outraged — let alone how Americans would feel.

This is how the Vietnamese express pride in the war. They constantly boast about having defeated the U.S. and the French, rather than showing any intention of reconciliation. Not to mention, they’re actively lobbying to get lower tariffs on goods exported to the U.S.

I read of setting up real manufacturing by aligning with countries like India which actually manufacture goods, Vietnam has been doing low value assembling or value addition on almost all the raw material and components coming from China.

For example - when cars are manufactured you find an entire ecosystem of Tier 1-7 manufacturers setting up factories all around the OEM. There is a popular saying that when Hyundai sets up a factory, it brings the whole village with it. However in Vietnam you see that the factories being setup import almost all of the components/material from China that is already finished and then assemble and send it off.

Hence I guess somewhere the government needs to rethink whether it wants to be the China+1 or be an independent manufacturing country.",2025-04-07 15:34:34,3,Fine_Carpenter9774,VietNam

In Vietnam, you can see a dentist, which does not happen often in Louisiana. Living standards in Da Nang are orders of magnitude better than Louisiana.

No one wants to live in Louisiana (or almost). Out of 50 states, here's how it ranks. Corporations use it as a manufacturing center, which they call  ""Cancer Alley."" Vietnam may want to take a look at what happens when you let companies pollute with no regard for their citizens' health.  This is what happens, just a heads up:

\_\_\_\_\_\_ GPT-4o

\> Health Outcomes • Louisiana ranks 50th (last) or 49th for overall health outcomes, including high rates of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.

Sure — here are 12 statistics where Louisiana ranks at or near the bottom compared to other U.S. states (as of the latest data from 2023–2024):

1. Poverty Rate •	Louisiana often ranks #1 or #2 highest poverty rate (\~19–20%), well above the national average.
2. Median Household Income •	Louisiana ranks among the bottom five states for lowest median household income (around $55,000 compared to U.S. average of \~$74,000).
3. Education (K-12 performance) •	Regularly ranks in the bottom five for overall public school performance and reading/math proficiency.
4. Health Outcomes •	Louisiana ranks 50th (last) or 49th for overall health outcomes, including high rates of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.
5. Life Expectancy •	It’s in the bottom 3 for shortest life expectancy (\~73 years compared to national average of 77–78).
6. Crime Rate (Violent Crime) •	Consistently #1 or #2 for highest violent crime rate, particularly in cities like New Orleans and Baton Rouge.
7. Infant Mortality Rate •	Among the worst five states for highest infant mortality rates.
8. Maternal Mortality Rate •	Louisiana has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the U.S.
9. Environmental Quality •	Regularly ranks at the bottom for air and water quality, with high levels of industrial pollution (especially along the “Cancer Alley” stretch of the Mississippi River).
10. Economic Opportunity •	Consistently ranked bottom 5 for economic opportunity (jobs, wages, career mobility).
11. Infrastructure Quality •	Louisiana ranks near last for poor infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and public transportation.
12. COVID-19 Outcomes •	During the pandemic, Louisiana had some of the highest COVID-19 death rates per capita.",2025-04-07 14:48:15,-1,ejpusa,VietNam

mnweq79,1k2rftd,reddit,"As I was commenting on another board some months ago when discussing Ukraine, for at least 40-50 years now, American intervention in Cold War context has always been from bad to disastrous for the side that they support. The last time it came out alright was with Germany, Japan, South Korea in the immediate aftermath of World War 2. After that, we got an uninterrupted series of either disadvantageous or terrible outcome for America's favorite local side: Cuba, Vietnam, Nicaragua, Afghanistan, Syria, now Ukraine, the list goes on.

It's not necessarily because America's intention is bad, or that their cause was not ""righteous"" (sometimes the cause was arguably less bad than the other side). The biggest problem is that: 1/ America is never interested in what the common people think and care about, and 2/ America ALWAYS think money solves all problems. The first thing the US do is throw money and weapons into the conflict, and when problem arrives, instead of trying to understand and resolve and/or negotiate, American would always double down and throw even MORE money and weapons in. What does money do? It corrupts, and A LOT of money (compared to the standard of living in these countries) just corrupts spectacularly. Mean while, more weapons may prolong the conflict and increase its deadliness, but it never changes the outcome. The side that got US money and weapons are always the losing side, eventually.

Inevitably, after each failure, there would be reams and reams of ""reports"" and ""lessons learnt"" and commentary from all the decision makers about why it was wrong, what was wrong and what should be changed. But the next conflict arrives and like clockwork, the same sh\*t happens again. Granted, it may serve America's national interest to have an outlet to spend all that money (in the name of foreign assistance) and weapons (raison d'être for the huge American military industrial complex). Maybe that's why America keeps following that same failing MO for so long. But it's generally bad for the local population on both side of each of the conflicts.",2025-04-19 09:04:33,39,labzone,VietNam

I’m not American. Worth saying that. And I think trump is a moron. But none of that matters. 

He’s said he 
1. Thinks some things have tariffs that are too high like electronics. It’s a fair point. But I understand why Vietnam wants to discourage people buying from the US. That’s also a fair point. 

2. Thinks that some goods are mislabeled as being Vietnamese products, but originates actually from China or Russia. Re labeled goods is a huge problem, and any country doing that should expect the same rate as the countries they relabel for. 

3. Wants US businesses to sell more in Vietnam (reduce trade deficit). I think Vietnam should protect themselves from this as much as they can, but that has its risks (including higher tariffs). 

The numbers we see are not the numbers. This is all negotiation, rates aren’t decided and so they will change. Trump says that in the current situation, the US is offering xyz rate. So Vietnam then makes a counter offer. This is just negotiation and perfectly normal. It’s just a bit more public than usual. 

These deals negatively impact my home country too, but we will just have to sell into other markets and accept that the US will look out mostly for themselves (as do all countries).",2025-04-12 10:28:39,-6,Warm_Honeydew7440,VietNam

mlf10hu,1jrfykj,reddit,"Absolutely. We need to wait and see. Too many people would rather fear-monger and spread their own anxiety onto others. Just wait for more developments. The tariffs don’t even take effect until April 9. Which means there’s time given for other countries’ leadership to make a call and discuss. That’s the whole point of this. The tariffs aren’t meant to be long-term or sustainable. That’s why the rates were determined the way they were. 

The goal isn’t to screw the other country. The goal is to make a favorable deal for the US. I know people will try to say that’s one and the same. But not always. And in this case…let’s see what To Lam and Trump can iron out.

Not much consumption of American goods on their side but plenty of consumption of stuff made or ""finished"" in Vietnam. From which they're already reaping the benefits of the previous trade war and want to see if they can remain that bypass gateway. The other countries will generally speaking use them as a proxy to finish the product there, then export it without tariffs. Vietnam collects extra some extra capital, the company avoids the tariff, and the good still gets to the US. Unfortunately for the american consumer however, the median prices of goods will still be up across the board for them despite a 0% tariff place (corporations will corporation) and ultimately remain more expensive regardless.

This whole tariff circus is just Trump bargaining chips Vietnam is quick enough to be one of the first one to enter the talk with the US. Trump would like very much a talk with Vietnam too since Vietnam is far too important for many US companies so Trump is getting lobby from within the US as well.

Think of it like this, you are at a store looking to buy a kitchen item like a ""chop scraper"" on the shelf there are 3 different kinds, one priced at $14.99, one priced at $11.99, and one priced at $5.99, guess what the $5.99 is made in vietnam, but its only priced for $5.99 under a zero tariff deal.

A big neighbhourhood bully asking one of its victims to work with it to stand against someone who is standing up to him. The big irony. 

Vietnam and China are both manufacturing powerhouse of their own kind. This relationship isn’t going to be a good match. No one wants to be the buyer and everyone wants to be the seller. 

China will up its antics in the South China Sea against Vietnam if Vietnam doesn’t do what it wants.

Anyone who’s saying China is winning this trade war cuz Xi is visiting three Southeast Asian trading partners, please wake up, Trump has 59 world leaders waiting to make negotiations with him for the next three months. China isn’t winning, it’s desperate. 

VCP must not side with China and negotiate with Trump for a favourable trade terms that benefits Vietnam and its people only. It’s time Vietnam ban all re-routing of Chinese goods and diversify its import markets from fellow ASEAN. 

Literally, God bless Vietnam. It’s really stuck between a rock and a hard place but if the leaderships can negotiate well with Trump then the country’s economy will do just fine.",2025-04-15 23:27:20,-7,greenie1996,VietNam

Quote: My own view of Vietnam’sreforms has been revised considerably from the rather more optimistic one Iheld at the time of my first few visits in the 1990s. 

Vietnam’s oldergeneration of communist leaders, I now believe, is incapable of breakingout of a fundamentally socialist mindset.

They had initially agreed toembark on the journey of reforms because they could see that the country
was not going anywhere. 

But they have not since come close to exhibitingthe genuine determination to overhaul the system that one finds in China.

These Old Guard leaders are keeping Vietnam stagnant.

Singapore was not always squeaky clean. We are all the same, us SEA countries, our people’s “working DNA” has similarities. But LKY and his team had the gumption (or power play) to stamp out corruption and we got to where we are today. 

To be fair there is still corruption in Singapore (see the most recent incidents) because people are still people. But on a societal and individual level, it’s seen as unacceptable and frowned upon. You are playing with fire if you try to bribe a cop in Singapore.

mmunq0h,1jxyvbp,reddit,"I am Chinese. Originally, I held this view, but now I think the possibility is slim. There are three reasons for this.

First, whether it was Japan, the Four Asian Tigers, or China's rapid development, they all grew with the support of the U.S. market. However, looking at the current tariff war, the U.S. market has effectively closed itself off to the world. The United States is now focusing on bringing manufacturing back home.

Second, setting aside the broader global context, Vietnam has developed for many years but has not demonstrated the same growth potential as East Asian countries. Currently, Vietnam's per capita GDP is comparable to that of China in 2007 and South Korea in 1986. In those years, China and South Korea had R&D expenditures accounting for about 1.4% of their GDP, while Vietnam's R&D expenditure is only 0.3%. R&D investment is a decisive factor in determining whether a country can become a developed nation. Given the existing certain level of capital accumulation, Vietnam's extremely low R & D level indicates that there are not enough enterprises and universities in Vietnam capable of undertaking R & D functions.With such a low R&D investment, Vietnam is likely to experience stagnation in GDP growth once its income reaches the level of seven to eight thousand U.S. dollars, just like other Southeast Asian countries.

Third, there is the issue of social governance. While China has faced serious corruption issues, its institutional framework has enabled the country to crack down on corruption with high pressure. Although Vietnam's system may appear similar to China's on the surface, there are significant differences. Vietnam's governance model, which relies on regional factional checks and balances, makes it difficult for the country to enforce strict anti-corruption measures. For example, regarding the military's involvement in business, China allowed the military to engage in business activities in the past because the country was so poor that it needed funds for development, and the military had to fend for itself. However, once the economy began to grow in the late 1990s, China banned the military from engaging in business. Vietnam, on the other hand, has not been able to achieve this.

Fourth, if corruption is not effectively treated and solved for a long time, and is allowed to devour society, there may be two possible results. One is similar to the color revolution in Ukraine. The whole society collapses, and the achievements of economic development over the years are destroyed. The second is similar to the Philippines, where corrupt elements take away most of the achievements of economic development, which eventually leads to a sharp decline in the country's development level and becomes a failed state.

Due to Vietnam's communist system, the first possibility is higher. The good news is that the United States Agency for International Development, which specializes in color revolutions, has been disbanded.

I hope Vietnam can solve the corruption problem as soon as possible. After all, there are not many socialist countries in the world.",2025-04-13 05:15:40,45,Impressive_Two_2539,VietNam

China is too heavily involved in Vietnams economy. The fact that China is so involved in Vietnam’s domestic and international trade should be a red flag. Vietnam cannot allow this to continue. 

Yes, the US is also heavily involved in Vietnam’s economy, but I’d much rather see Vietnam stick with the US and continued the good path with America than China. After all, it’s the Americans who has helped built up Vietnams economy, not China. 

In 2024, Vietnam exports over $119billion to the USA while it imports over $144billion from China, practically taking money from the Americans to give to the Chinese. I find this little fact to be outrageous considering the relationship the two has with each other. The $144 billion imports from China may be why Vietnam’s offers of zero tariffs was rejected by the Trumps administration. 

Heck, Vietnam imports over $81.8billion from Korea in 2024. How could Vietnam afford Korean goods when Korean goods are more expensive. So the arguments of the “UsA hAs 250 mILliOn MoRe PeOpLE ThAn ViEtNaM” and “UsA iS mOrE ExPeNsIvE to bUy FrOm” is mostly debunked here. 

Rather than importing more goods from China, Vietnam should diversify its import markets to other countries in ASEAN or Africa. Sure, Chinese goods may be cheaper but we all know why it’s cheaper. I rather see Vietnamese money go towards friendly countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, or the Philippines to support them than China. 

If Vietnam wishes to become a modern high income country, it needs to change fast. It can’t continue to copy off of China on how to develop its economy anymore. Nor can it expect to enjoy the free ride that Korea and Japan had in their trade paths with the Americans. Those days are over for Vietnam. It needs to innovate and adapt to the new reality fast.

The Americans have already seen what happens when they help a poor undemocratic/communist China become prosperous. They are not going to risk repeating their mistakes with Vietnam. The Americans have come a long way to the deceptions and dishonesty of the CCP. The Vietnamese communist leadership hasn’t yet done anything to show they are different than their Chinese counterpart, sure social media is allowed but has anything else changed? 

Ban Chinese companies from operating in Vietnam. Put an end to Chinese transporting their goods through Vietnam. Tariffing American products to protect domestic industries while simultaneously allowing competing industries from China to operate just doesn’t make sense. These Chinese companies will decimate local industries. Sure they hire locals, but odds are high the employees aren’t well paid and are probably abused like workers in Africa. 

Vietnam should make it a priority to adopt fair trade practice and developed transparent laws that aligns with international standard. The west and many developed countries already have sophisticated laws created, Vietnam can just copy after them on this front. 

Vietnam needs to invest more into supporting small and medium size private domestic enterprises instead. They are the future of the country. Vietnamese people are not dumb, they just aren’t allowed to be too entrepreneurial and innovative because of the VCP fear of losing power.

Diversify the export markets to more countries in South America, Africa, Europe and the rest of Asia and cater to their needs. 

Postpone projects like the $67-100 billion dollars North-South high speed train. This reckless spending will ruin Vietnams economy more so than Americas tariffs. Vietnam does not need a vanity project like a HST, it should use the money and invest it into its own people’s education and let them solve the country’s problems. 

****this is my prediction: People who actually believes Trumps tariff is a sign that America is in a decline are dead wrong. Should this tariff  continue for the next 5 years and Trumps successor keeps it up, then it will mean the end of the CCP. China’s domestic economy is in a shamble from high debts and massive corruptions, and they need American money to keep them afloat. Trump is cutting off their only source of life line. Once the CCP collapses to internal revolution, it will spread to Vietnam. 

I don’t know about anyone, but I do hope that day comes soon when Vietnam will become a democratic society. Yes, the communist in Vietnam is not the same as the Chinese but they need to understand that communism is outdated and no longer suitable for the 21th century. Vietnam cannot prosper under communism. The VCP needs to hand over power to other suitable style of governance and let competent leaders take over. They should not worry about being persecuted like the CCP, the past is in the past and history has already shown that the VCP did what was best for Vietnams independence and that they really did meant to do well for the people but their intentions got corrupted along the way. 

 Why do I keep supporting trump despite his tariffs on Vietnam? Because Trump is standing up for poor Americans, he’s taking money from the rich and giving it to the poor. And in doing so, he’s forcing Vietnam to re-examine and evaluate its priorities of how it will achieve its path to high income/developed status. It’s forcing Vietnam to confront the growing Chinese influence at home and many more tough questions and tougher scenarios that require uncomfortable answers to solve. Modernity comes with many strings attached and if the VCP is uncomfortable confronting them then they’re not ready for modernity",2025-04-09 17:22:33,0,greenie1996,VietNam
mm4eq1z,1junu0b,reddit,"While reddit crowd thinks all this means the country is cooked, I'm hopeful the government is a bit smarter than the crowd here. This is an opportunistic time as China will not back down. If Vietnam can work out deals then exports and manufacturing will shift from China to other parts of Asia, and Vietnam is a great spot. 

One, it's lopsided and this isn't about shoes and shirts. There are whole cities in the US Vietnamese basically own both in business and homes, US allows full green cards to residents with the right qualifications. US even allowed VinFast to enter US market and the stock exchange.   
  
In comparison, Vietnam basically closes access to US citizens both in big business, real estate and still makes US residents one of the only western countries to do e-visa instead of visa on arrival entry. Is that fair? 

Tariffs placed on US good coming in range between 8% to 17%, and historically it was quite equal on Vietnam good to US but with a trade imbalance of $123 billion. If you don't want to trade with a country, then it's just outflowing cash without any reciprocal partnership. Vietnam can close this gap with purchasing  LNG, defense products and agricultural products they buy elsewhere. Furthermore, stop being so tight on foreigners who come her to spend money and want to open up business to boost the economy and gain tax dollars. Koreans have it made here and China even more so, so fine, if you want to just work with them, then the US can purchase elsewhere and Vietnam can lose $136 billion.   
  
There is also the issue the government doesn't address. And that is Vietnam allowing China goods to come in to Vietnam for shipping to avoid tariffs. And I'm sure there's some kickback to do that, but it's not fooling the US and it's a big reason for these tariffs. It needs to be proactively fixed if Vietnam wants to become a good trade partner, otherwise it's just a front for China goods.",2025-04-08 23:23:12,-13,didyouticklemynuts,VietNam

That's the problem: Most Vietnamese aren't aware that they're being racist; to them racism only comes into play when the Vietnamese themselves are at disadvantage. 

It's just colorism at work again: Vietnamese culture conflates pale skinned Vietnamese as rich, intelligent and polite, while dark skinned Vietnamese are poor, uneducated and rude. Unfortunately this spills over to how they perceive other races as well, with the same implications.

North is also where colorism is more prevalent. And why am I not surprised it's the Northerners again, lol.",2025-04-14 11:58:14,2,Thick_Help_1239,VietNam

Maybe not in the same way. More like assuming I was rich because I'm a white foreigner. Grab drivers talking and laughing while stopped at lights probably about my size on the back of their bikes. Like look at this big dumb foreigner why doesn't he just take a car. 


But in relation to being a black (teacher I assume) yeah I can see why to their less educated brains they don't associate that with English. But then for a lot of locals they are more focussed on their day to day lives than understanding about the world and immigration.

I am as an Vietnamese living in Canada sometimes visit a very white demographic town and I can see the glare and stare and whisper. It does not feel good at all but I've tried to understand from their POV and tried not to take it too personal.

That's being said, I am sorry for your experience. I think Vietnamese people are friendly but there is always racism in the background. Just for your knowledge, 15, 20 years ago, we used to be racist to our own race within the country because of the war.

**EMBASSY OF POLAND**  
Soviet Russia played a part in the rise of Nazi Germany's military [power.How](http://power.How) was this possible?   
After World War I, heavy arms restrictions were imposed on Germany. Berlin cleverly circumvented them through illegal collaboration with the Soviet Union.  This allowed them to quickly rebuild their military potential, which led to the start of the World War II in Europe.    
Forbidden German tank and military aircraft constructions were tested in research centres in the USSR:  in Kazan (KAMA Tank School),  Lipetsk (Lipetsk fighter-pilot school), and Volsk (TOMKA gas test site).    
Thanks to this secret German-Soviet cooperation, Germany developed new weapons and military strategies in a very short time.   
Modern armed forces, especially tanks and military aircraft, were the key component to the Nazi Third Reich's military success. And it all started with the signing of the Treaty of Rapallo on 16 April 1922.   
Ironically, today the Russian authorities justify their aggression against Ukraine precisely by fighting neo-Nazism and fascism

* drivers are verified and trained to provide great hostipility manners
* many coupon and have daily/weekly/monthly riding packs so it is much more cheaper
* beside booking for ride, you can also order food to your place
* check for the traffic jam in the region (I think not may people get to know this one)

TLDR: not offensive to wear in Vietnam but will offend older generation South Vietnamese people (think age 50 and above) abroad that were affected by Vietnam's civil war (AKA the Vietnam War).

Edit to add: As you are American, it would be good to note that this would also offend anyone that served in the Vietnam War, especially American Vietnam veterans as USA was the primary backer for the South Vietnamese and participated in the war.. and lost. So, American Vietnam veterans also carry the trauma load of that war and what this symbol represents. They'd be at least 72 by now if they served in that war; it's safe to assume it's sensitive to Americans that age and above. That hat has the ability to trigger PTSD for those in this population that have not yet made peace with their experiences of that war.

Longer Explanation: So, this military hat represents the Communist view of Vietnam because it adorns the North Vietnamese flag (red with a yellow star in the middle). The South Vietnamese had their own flag (yellow with three red horizontal stripes) which has dissolved since the North won the civil war and ""unified"" Vietnam under one flag. I don't know the South Africa story, but I imagine the South African got in trouble because he bought this hat while touring Vietnam and then wore it back in his home country and beefed with an older generation South Vietnamese that was affected by the war (think refugee camps, displacement, war crimes, close ones dying in front of their face from disease, famine, war shit). The older generation Southern Vietnamese get triggered when they see this symbol. The newer generation have no idea and did not experience the war, so they're not in the know to care.",2025-03-29 10:00:37,13,odinhsraven,VietNam

Those communities have a lot of RVN veterans and loyalists who fled the country after the war, and they would see any loyalty to the current government coming out of their own community as an offense directed specifically at them.

On the other hand, if you're not Vietnamese then you could wear that hat walking down the street in Little Saigon in San Jose or Garden Grove and very few would be offended by it. They'd understand you were just wearing a souvenir and not making a political statement. If anything, they'd be impressed that you'd actually visited Vietnam.

I'm not Vietnamese, but my wife is - born and lived most of her life in Central Vietnam. She has bought me souvenir clothing with the modern VN flag on it.

The cinematographer is pretty good, war scenes, CGI looks realistic, actings are high quality. Characters feel real, with solid background stories and even flawed too.

But the editing is shit tier. Some parts are confusing. The director is good, but he shouldn’t do the writing. With better writing and editing, this movie can even compete in Oscar. Right now, it’s just a mediocre movie",2025-04-19 15:57:24,63,Subject-Creme,VietNam

> * Xi begins three-nation Southeast Asia trip in Hanoi
> * Vietnam tightens controls on some China trade under US pressure
> * China, Vietnam sign agreements on rail links, supply chains
> * Vietnam greenlights jets approved by China, government says
> * China's COMAC signs deal with Vietjet, document shows

> HANOI, April 14 (Reuters) - China's President Xi Jinping on Monday called for stronger ties with Vietnam on trade and supply chains amid disruptions caused by U.S. tariffs, as he attended in Hanoi the signing of dozens of cooperation agreements between the two Communist-run nations.
> The visit, planned for weeks and part of a wider trip in Southeast Asia, comes as Beijing faces 145% U.S. duties, while Vietnam is negotiating a reduction of threatened U.S. tariffs of 46% that would otherwise apply in July after a global moratorium expires.

> ""The two sides should strengthen cooperation in production and supply chains,"" Xi said in an article in Nhandan, the newspaper of Vietnam's Communist Party, posted ahead of his arrival on Monday. He also urged more trade and stronger ties with Hanoi on artificial intelligence and the green economy.
> ""There are no winners in trade wars and tariff wars,"" Xi added, without mentioning the U.S. specifically.
> After he met Vietnam's top leader To Lam, the two countries signed dozens of cooperation agreements, footage of the documents reviewed by Reuters showed, including deals on enhancing supply chains and on cooperation over railways.
> The content of the agreements was not disclosed and it was unclear whether they involved any financial or binding commitments.
> On Saturday Vietnam's Deputy Prime Minister Bui Thanh Son had said around 40 agreements would be signed. A separate aviation business deal was signed on Sunday.
> Under pressure from Washington, Vietnam is tightening controls on some trade with China to make sure goods exported to the United States with a ""Made in Vietnam"" label have sufficient added value in the country to justify that.
> One memorandum of understanding signed on Monday is to boost cooperation between the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which issues certificates on the origins of goods.
> Vietnam is a major industrial and assembly hub in Southeast Asia. Most of its imports are from China while the United States is its main export market. The country is a crucial source of electronics, shoes and apparel for the United States.
> In the first three months of this year Hanoi imported goods worth about $30 billion from Beijing while its exports to Washington amounted to $31.4 billion, Vietnam's customs data show, confirming a long-term trend in which imports from China closely match the value and swings of exports to the U.S.
> 
> ^Vietnam's ^exports ^to ^the ^United ^States ^have ^increased ^in ^parallel ^with ^its ^imports ^from ^China ^in ^recent ^years

> **RAIL LINKS, PLANES**

> After a two-day stop in Hanoi, Xi will continue his Southeast Asian trip on Tuesday by visiting Malaysia and Cambodia from April 15 to 18. He last visited Cambodia and Malaysia nine and 12 years ago, respectively.
> 
> Xi's trip to Hanoi, his second in less than 18 months, aims to consolidate relations with a neighbour that has received billions of dollars of Chinese investments in recent years as China-based manufacturers moved south to avoid tariffs imposed by the first Trump administration.
> Vietnam's Lam in an article published on Monday on state media said Hanoi wanted to boost cooperation in defence, security and infrastructure, especially on rail links.
> Vietnam has agreed to use Chinese loans to build new railways between the two countries, in a major confidence-building step that would boost bilateral trade and connections.
> However, no loan agreement has yet been announced.
> After prolonged pressure, Beijing obtained Vietnam's approval for planes authorised by the Chinese aviation regulator, which paves the way for the use of China-made COMAC passenger jets in the Southeast Asian nation.
> Hanoi recognised China's regulator as equal to those of the United States and the European Union, according to a decree the government approved the day before Xi arrived, and disclosed on the government portal on Monday.
> COMAC planes are operated by several Chinese companies but have so far struggled to find foreign buyers or be approved abroad.
> On Sunday, Vietnam's budget airline VietJet (VJC.HM)
> , opens new tab and COMAC signed a memorandum of understanding in Hanoi, according to an invitation to the event seen by Reuters.
> One COMAC C909 regional plane with Vietjet's livery and the logo of China's Chengdu Airlines was parked on Monday at Hanoi international airport.
> The content of the agreement has not been announced yet, but Reuters reported in past weeks that under a draft deal, Vietjet would lease two COMAC C909 planes, operated by crew from Chengdu Airlines, on two domestic routes.
> Despite strong economic ties, tensions frequently surface between the two countries over contested boundaries in the South China Sea.
> Vietnam's concessions to the U.S. to avoid tariffs may also irritate Beijing, as they include the deployment of Elon Musk's Starlink satellite communication service in the Southeast Asian nation, in addition to the crackdown on some trade with China over possible fraud on rules of origin.
> Vietnam, in recent months, has also imposed anti-dumping duties on several Chinese steel products and ended a tax waiver for low-value parcels in a move that government officials described as aimed at reducing the inflow of cheap Chinese goods.
> The two other countries on Xi's Southeast Asia itinerary, Cambodia and Malaysia, are facing U.S. duties of 49% and 24% respectively, and have already begun reaching out to the U.S. to seek a reprieve.

The VCP might be corrupt AF but they're also damn smart, by requesting tariffs to be completely removed bilaterally show that they're not just trying to avoid the tariff but they're also seeking to exploit the situation to turn it into Vietnam's advantage and kill two birds with one stone,. With 0% tariffs Vietnam will be even more attractive to FDI, and by getting the US into the SCS under guise of economic cooperation, it would also add another counterweight to China and further enhance regional security. Trump loves this sort of thing and he had already suggested this with Ukraine.

That and obviously the VCP will also throw Trump and few more golf resort contracts, with blackjack and hookers, to sweeten the deal.",2025-04-05 04:09:22,8,DaVietDoomer114,VietNam

Figuratively speaking, “xe om” means “*hug the driver*” in Vietnamese, but surely one does not have to actually commit the act (anyway, if that’s what you want, it is probably fine). One simply needs to board behind the back of the driver, put the helmet on and get ready to be a part of the organized chaos that is Vietnamese traffic!

One piece of advice I can give you is her parents (or grandparents) are rich, not her. Once you marry her, you become her ""provider,"" and since she grew up rich, she will have certain expectations. Additionally, wealthy families are very good at protecting their wealth, so just because you marry into her family doesn't mean part of it, or any of it, comes to you/her.

What her family wants is for her to find a husband and create a matrifocal or matriarch family where she gets to decide what's up.

I'm not saying it might all go bad, it could work out but new-rich (basically all the rich in VN are new-rich) seem to think of themselves very highly.

I was born in Hanoi but left when was a baby, came back on a trip, met my now wife who was the daughter of a good friend of my parents who I was just passing through visiting.

They were not poor, but not rich, maybe middle-class to just slightly upper middle class. They DID care who I was before we got married. Her mother (who I get along with well) said if she had a choice she would rather her daughter not have fallen in love with someone who lives in another country (nothing against me but her daughter would move away).

That is a how a normal parent would act, not wanting their child to move to another country but understanding if she did because of falling in love.

Ironically her family then did get wealthy after we got married so when we visit back to VN now we stay in one for their multiple houses  and get treated well. 

BUT my situation was that our parents were friends before she or I were born, both sides of the family are friends/know each other so it generally is good in my situation.  

Maybe go and meet her, if you get along then fine, if her family is good to you great! if they aren't but you and her really hit it off then be your own man and make a life yourselves without letting the parents control it. 

It might be they are nice people and it could also work out. only way to find out is to at least visit and meet her and her family, spend some time and see how you feel.

moboapg,1k18fr5,reddit,"I am pro-nuclear power. I believe we are at the point where were are going to be capable of using it. 

However, reading the article, the plan sounds far-fetched. 

1) 183-236 GWh of power is a huge amount. The world's largest hydroelectric dam generates an average of 95 GWh. This plan is looking at 2 to 3 times the amount. Vietnam has a lot of smart people, but not enough engineers in the energy sector, and EVN could use more training.

2)  The goal of the first nuclear power plants to come online between 2030-2035 means that the power goal is without nuclear power. That's going to be even harder. Also, while there are partial starts of two reactors, having new vendors and build-in-place technology, the partially built site can barely be used, thus the total time to completion is nearly the total length of time. With large reactors, we are looking at 9-12 years, assuming no overbudget problems. This timeline can be done with smaller modular new designs but both Russia and Japan are the vendors of preference, and they have no current small reactor designs. Thus, we are looking at large plants. This is going to have overbudget and geological issues.

3) The current budget of $136 B over 5 years is 6.3% of our GDP, and that is 78.8% of our current government spending. So that is nearly double the government spending. How can this keep up?

4) Lastly, do we have enough capacity to store energy for the larger increase of renewables? Renewables are highly volatile, and without large Lithium-Ion Batteries or, better yet, Gravity batteries, the grid would be highly inefficient and unreliable. In addition, wind power has the problem of large maintenance difficulties in its cycles. Within 5 years, this could prevent us from reaching even the numbers for wind power. 

Unless we have a large increase in engineers, very large foreign investments, and add in spending for gravity batteries, we will rely on coal power to fill in the gap (despite the goal to reduce coal by a third), and end up not having enough funding and human capital to make this work, costing us much more money and much more time to catch up. 

  
This is my 2 cents. I want us to succeed. And I feel that needs better plans, less corruption, and tangible steps instead of promises.",2025-04-21 21:20:31,1,qjpham,VietNam

At this point, it’s only fair game Vietnam demands China to fix its trade deficit with us. Every countries will repeat after trump in demanding trade balance from their partners, especially if China is heavily involved in their economy. If China doesn’t comply and fix their trade deficit with Vietnam then it’s fair game for Vietnam to do what’s best for itself. 

China is probably going to want to flood Vietnam and ASEAN with Chinese goods to make up for the loss of the US market. Vietnam can either allow it and risk protests from Vietnamese people. Or Vietnam can counter this by exporting Chinese goods to none American markets, but it risk getting tariffed. 

China wants Vietnam to get tariffed cuz they believe they have contributed more than the Vietnamese people to Vietnams current economic successes. They see this as fair game that Vietnam should suffer with them. Vietnam can embrace economic hardship but it will face social unrest, protests and eventual political instability like Thailand. 

China is going to up their wolf warrior diplomacy against third world countries they have a lot of economic control over. 

Best pill for Vietnam to take is to negotiate and be transparent with both sides. 

“Hey USA, you don’t want China to export their goods through us? sure, no problem. What do you want to see instead? Let us know so we can try and work something out with China, too” 

“Hey China, USA isn’t happy with you because of xyz and they want to see xyz from you, and as for us, we cannot do xyz but we can do xyz, so what do you think needs to change? We are open to suggestions but if you don’t have one, then we will have to come up with something that works best for us, it’s nothing personal”",2025-04-21 12:40:40,-5,greenie1996,VietNam

I see many comments talking about specifically about Vietnam, but not about China. If you look at the trade charts between the US and Vietnam, you'd see it tick up *a lot*, after those first Chinese tariffs in 2016-2020.

However the WSJ article spoke about how it's like whackamole. So those Chinese companies that diverted to Vietnam what happens to them? They go somewhere else? Laos?

And it came to pass in the latter days, that the leader of the land, called Trump, did raise his hand against the nations, proclaiming tariffs and tributes upon the merchants of China, the isles of Japan, the kingdoms of Canada and Mexico, and the confederation of Europe, saying: “Let there be a levy of tenfold upon their goods, and upon China an hundred and twenty-fivefold, that our barns may be filled and our presses burst forth with new wine.”

Thus did the markets tremble, and the traders were dismayed, for the burdens were heavy upon their shoulders, and the price of wares did soar as the eagle soareth in the sky.

And in those days, the leader set his face against his adversaries, revoking the seals of secrecy from many, among them the former rulers Biden and Clinton, and their counselors, saying: “They shall no longer walk in the counsel of the privy, nor shall the hidden things be revealed unto them.”

And he spake, saying: “Lo, I shall stretch forth my hand against mine enemies, and bring them to judgment, that the land may be purged of iniquity.”

Then the scribes and the wise men murmured among themselves, saying: “Behold, these things stir up strife among the people, and set brother against brother; for the path is made dark, and the way is hedged up with thorns.”

Yet the leader hardened his heart, and heeded not the counsel of the elders, but walked in the imagination of his own heart, saying: “I shall be a wall unto this people, and a fortress in the day of battle.”

Thus were the days filled with tumult, and the people looked one to another, wondering what the end of these things should be.",2025-04-10 12:18:10,2,Tiberiux,VietNam

**- The Final Memos at the White House: The Collapse of the Republic of Vietnam.**

**- When the Allies Fled.**

  
My conclusion:

By 1974, South Vietnam was already on the brink of collapse. After the 1973 Paris Peace Accords, the United States had withdrawn its combat troops and significantly reduced military and economic aid. The 1973 Arab-Israeli War triggered a global oil crisis that severely impacted South Vietnam’s import-dependent economy, leading to inflation, fuel shortages, and declining public morale. Meanwhile, the South Vietnamese military was overstretched, facing growing desertions and weakening defenses as North Vietnam escalated attacks. With President Nixon’s resignation in 1974 and growing opposition in the U.S. Congress, South Vietnam was left without the support it had once relied on. In practical terms, the United States had effectively abandoned its ally, leaving the Republic of Vietnam to face mounting internal and external pressures alone.",2025-04-21 04:53:39,52,Sad_Year5694,VietNam

mo91kms,1k44s4a,reddit,"South Vietnam was going to fall before the war even started. I'm friends with many American advisors and soldiers who saw the signs as early as 1964. 

MAJ W was an advisor in III Corps. (Saigon area) in 1964 - 65. He reported encountering some locals and troops who were already planning on how the area would look after the North took over. 

In 1972, LT. M was an Aero Scout Platoon Leader fighting during the Easter Offensive and was attempting to coordinate a rescue of high-level American advisors and South Vietnamese who were surrounded. What he saw with the ARVN were armorer hamlets. They had no coordination and no care about trying to synchinize with local commanders. They only cared about defending their specific area. He knew the war was lost and stopped caring about the war. Just that him and his men survived. 

Command structure was stupid in South Vietnam. It was based on social hierarchy, with  those of noble backgrounds being allowed to have higher commands. Promotions were also held up. I haven't ever been impressed with most Vietnamese leadership, the same for Americans who worked alongside them. 

I've also heard many American counterparts despise how South Vietnamese would take helicopters that could've been used to help troops and would load their families inside so they could flee to the nearest carrier. Imagine being a soldier who is surrounded, and your buddies need MEDEVAC, but you can't get any help because someone stole all the helicopters and flew them away.

“Today’s IEEPA Order also contains modification authority, allowing President Trump to increase the tariff if trading partners retaliate **or** decrease the tariffs if trading partners take significant steps to remedy non-reciprocal trade arrangements and align with the United States on economic and national security matters.”

What “…if trading partners take significant steps to remedy…” looks like, I have no idea. All it takes from countries’ leaders is a phone call and meeting to find out. And if they choose, to share that info with the people. 

So let’s just hope some phone calls can be made and terms discussed. This is obviously not meant to be a long term, sustainable solution. That much is obvious. This is a move to alarm and bring countries’ leaders to the table/phone. It’s a very aggressive move. Not friendly.

Likewise, I was in Hoi An one weekend and saw a street vendor peel the husk off a corn cob he'd sold... then stick the cob in a plastic bag. Again, I was horrified.

In the bao cấp period, the enameled iron cup is eveywhere because they are cheap and durable. Glassware at the time is a luxury. 

During the 90s, glass becomes cheaper (and bao cấp is no more), therefore people got access to glassware easily. I guess this is one of the first cheap and popular design at the time so everyone got that, and it kinda becomes extremely popular during the 90s and 2000s. That's mean different manufacturers were also copying that design as well.

With the 2010s coming, people got more money and higher requirement for nicer design. These cups are only kept for the nostalgia. That's why it's hard to find nowadays except sitting in a backcorner of a cupboard in an old home. Oh and I guess it's also a Northern thing as well.",2025-04-20 10:59:39,34,ghostsilver,VietNam

You might also be familiar with the pressure cooker that weight like 3-5kg and probably gonna outlive me in age (it literally over 67 years old now and still working fine, that thing is gonna be a family hairloom fr).

So the short and simple reason is, due to less competitive market, a product don't have too many different pattern and any new factory that make them try to copy the old design because it recognizable. 

It the same for those plastic chair and table, they got popular and people start to recognize it, new factory copy the same pattern (maybe change it abit) but keep the same visual because it boost sell",2025-04-21 07:05:13,2,SpookyEngie,VietNam

Functional waste management structure needs an efficient system of waste collection and disposal. That's really the secret. 

Vietnam would first need to start with getting rid of landfilling. Mostly that means building waste-to-energy capacity. That is how for example Western Europe does it. After that you can think about what you want to start recycling. Fundamentally if you don't have capacity to treat waste, you don't have a system of waste management.

Second is the system of waste collection. Make waste disposal easy for households and businesses and ta da, they become clean and won't litter. I'm convinced this has little to do with culture.

I have a son who was born here and a step-daughter who is Vietnamese. I got her when she was 7. From birth I taught my son, alongside my daughter to pick things up and put them away. Put trash in trash cans, hold doors open for people, on stairs walk on the right side, in aisles walk on the right side etc. he does it instinctively now and he is 6. She is 14 and has not changed one bit, nor has her mom. This is a characteristic of civilized people. It takes time and closer to civilized people for any people to become civilized . Many here have not seen the other side of the city they live in, let alone a civilized society. But we do have those that live abroad and come back and they are much different. They eat with their mouth closed, do not pick their nose at the dinner table and just seem to have caught on to civilized behaviors. So I think in the next 100-200 years they may become more exposed.

mnd95kk,1k0ds0e,reddit,"From Bloomberg reporters Andy Lin and Spe Chen: 

When President Donald Trump launched his first trade war with Beijing in 2018, driving up the cost of goods from China, companies raced to relocate factories making everything from computer chips to crop tops south of the border in Vietnam. The Southeast Asian country’s economy has boomed as a result, with growth in gross domestic product accelerating to 7% in 2024, the fastest in the region. But the surging volume of incoming parts and outbound finished products has also left Vietnam’s transport system under strain.

To alleviate the logistics bottleneck, the Vietnamese government is embarking on one of the largest infrastructure drives in its history, spending billions of dollars to expand national highways and add congestion-reducing alternative routes across the southernmost part of the country. These ambitious projects hinge on one key commodity: Cambodian sand.

Vietnam aims to complete more than 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) of highways in 2025 — assuming Trump’s latest trade war doesn’t derail things. But it’s running low on its own supply of sand, dredged from rivers then used to flatten and stabilize the ground before pavement is poured. Sand mining in Vietnam has been under stricter public scrutiny after multiple riverbank collapses destroyed homes and angered residents.

​Over the past 39 years, from 1985 to 2024, Vietnam's GDP increased approximately 30.9 times, growing from $14.09 billion in 1985 to an estimated $435.6 billion in 2024.

Over the past 64 years, from 1960 to 2024, Vietnam's GDP increased approximately 87.1 times, growing from an estimated $5 billion in 1960 to $435.6 billion in 2024.​

These figures illustrate Vietnam's significant economic growth over the decades.
(Data from Macrotrends.)

According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Vietnam is projected to be among the top 20 fastest-growing economies in 2025, with an estimated GDP growth rate of 6.1%. This positions Vietnam ahead of several regional counterparts, including China, Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia.​

But here's the thing: **a lot of Southeast Asia has those same strengths**. What makes the whole region exciting is that it's caught in the middle of big powers - China, India, and the U.S.. And countries there tend to work together and don’t fight much (ASEAN), which helps business.

Also, Southeast Asia is more open to free-market growth, just when the West is adding more rules and China is getting stricter. So, with all the cool new stuff coming - like AI and biotech - this region might be the perfect playground to try it all out.",2025-04-11 06:11:16,7,_Koch_,VietNam

1. Corruption - steps are being made which are positive, but it's not yet enough. It is deeply embedded culturally, creates enormous wastage / inefficiency, and puts a handbrake on progress, and also turns off a lot of FDI that could potentially come in. VN needs a massive mindset change top to bottom, and need to do it quickly.
2. Demographics - under the age of 20, there is a large surplus of boys and a large deficit of girls. It is a HUGE gap, and will result in a demographic crisis within 10-20 years.
3. Nepotism - I've lived in a number of countries, and the amount of times I've seen people succeed because of who they know, not what they know, is a bit astounding and incomparable to many other places.

mmjv0rn,1jw18ca,reddit,"As an Indian, I get why so many foreigners see Vietnam as a future economic powerhouse — and honestly, it makes a lot of sense.

Vietnam’s been growing fast, has a young and energetic population, and it’s clearly becoming a top choice for companies leaving China. Out of 72 companies that moved out of China, 70 chose Vietnam — that alone says a lot. It’s not just cheap labor — it’s also about political stability, decent infrastructure, and a government that seems willing to make real reforms.

One thing I really respect is how Vietnam’s handling agriculture. From what I’ve seen, there’s a clear push to boost productivity and reduce the number of people working in farming. That’s huge. When fewer people are stuck in agriculture and can move into manufacturing or services, it opens the door for faster, more sustainable growth.

In India, we tried to do something similar with farm reforms, but the government backed off. A lot of farmers are still trapped in a system controlled by middlemen. It’s inefficient and honestly pretty feudal.

So yeah, when people abroad say Vietnam has serious potential, I think they’re seeing the big picture. If Vietnam keeps going in this direction — raising productivity and shifting labor into more dynamic sectors — it’s on a solid path toward becoming a developed country. I wish we had more of that kind of political courage where I’m from.",2025-04-11 12:23:05,2,17045onliacco,VietNam

mmgg3oq,1jw18ca,reddit,"foreigner here from US who has come to learn a lot about vietnam over the past 4 years with quite a few visits.

The impressions I got from vietnam was that there were many people, fast construction, and people with incentive to both incentive to make money and improve their landscape.  I visitied HCM district 3. It was eye opening.  Relatively to my other experiences, the vibe I got from watching the city streets, markets, construction, landmarks, was rough but pure productivity.

Now in my speculation, I see vietnam as high potential because I think it's still relatively low and has much more to improve.  It has a much heigher ceiling to hit before growth stops.

As a tourist attraction, vietnam is also significantly unrecognized over here. It has both a lot of natural wonders, and large amounts of areas tourists could feel satisfied staying at (beachside hotels, areas around da lat, da nang).  Most simply won't consider it at the moment due to lack of direct flights, lack of english speaking signage/self navigation (if you leave the fancy district 1 bubble you're kinda out of luck), and lack of ""comfortable transportation"" (average karen might not want to ride on the back of a Grab to get around, they're dying for the metro).  And these definitely could change over time, realizing its potential on that.

In terms of politics, it's in a unique position playing ""two christmases"" (aka child of divorced parents trying to get free stuff from both sides) with US and china.  From my perspective, I have a yearning for people to go with mommy US and shut off daddy china, and it feels like once that happens, its economy will be ""liberated.""  What does that mean?  Honestly I can't see exactly how that plays out and not 100% that's entirely what's good.  China is an enormous part of the economy there.  But I don't think I'm the only foreigner with that view, thinking that ""potential will be unlocked"" overnight with some kind of exclusive deal with the US.  Just can't explain that whole position, but I can tell you it's an incentive for me to say ""vietnam is gonna be rich""

  
Economically, if I had to choose a SE asia region though who I think is going to become rich, it's definitely vietnam by far.  Their GDP was one of the top growing, if not the top, in recent years.  We all know all the companies from China are going there.  It seems to be the #1 second option.  So much of my clothes and other things have a made in vietnam tag (more than cambodia, more than india).  We also know that US has a vested interest because of political interests with them, so it's possible that they become easier to trade with.  

Likewise, comparing other nearby countries

\- Cambodia, Laos closer to china, so as an american, I usually won't bet on their success

\- phillipines seems doesn't seem like it has the sheer quanitity of manufacturing, so not sure

\- malaysia has a ton of manufacturing, but culturally as an american, is much more unknown of a country (even if they are more english speaking)

\- thailand looks already rich to me though idk actually

\- indonesia, I have no idea what goes on there at all

Lastly, simply from name's sake, everyone over here knows what a Vietnam is because of the war, so it'll be on analysts mind.  Trust me, analysts sometimes do pull things from a hat.

Again this is more to show my perspective, this is not supposed to be taken objective as an argument or fact.

More often, I'll get back some money b/c I gave them two bills stuck together. It is always best to clarify the cost before transactions, when possible, otherwise, pay attention b/c there are always a rotten apple in the bunch. Learn some basic phrases, such as "" hello"",  ""how much?"", ""thank you"". It goes a long way, as well as some of the other suggested phrases. 

Even if I'm not interested in buying anything, I am always asking for the cost of things, this way, I can get a good idea of what is a reasonable price for future purchases e.g. I purchased a SIM card at a Viettel shop for 10k and a month of data for 170k; long story short, I accidentally tossed my SIM at one point so I went to another shop. There, they wanted 500k just for the SIM, so I just walked out. You would think that a Viettel shop would be standardized...

Knowing the price of e.g. fruit can really help you haggle. The other day, I purchased 2 prepped pineapples for 25k. At another shop, the guy wanted 20k for one. 

When I approach a proprietor, I'll say, Xin chao, with a big smile. If they don't greet you with a warm response, they are the least likely to budge on their inflated prices in my experience.",2025-04-18 16:20:43,2,DonTing2000,VietNam

I am now just about to leave after a quick 10 day trip, the place has changed for the bad. Lots of nice people but WAY more scammers. Way more pushy people. I will not ever come back after this trip. I travel every year and was bummed I hadn’t been back to Vietnam for so long so made the effort to fit a quick trip in between other locations. What a waste of my time it was. It’s dirty. Like really dirty. Hair in just about everything I’ve eaten. Same as my wife. Pollution is really bad too. It is the smokier time of year but it’s bad. If you’re wanting to go to south east Asia skip Vietnam in my opinion. You won’t miss much other than coughing people, scams and pollution. 

Went to Cham Island on my trip this time and it’s advertised as plastic free. They even said to me you won’t even get a plastic straw there in a drink. (Which is pretty standard anywhere these days) 
Got there plastic everywhere. Everyone was selling stuff in plastic. Plastic in the water and in their crops. Yet big signs saying “say no to plastic”. The place is a joke. Also lots and lots of Indian tourists arguing about a matter of cents everywhere. That wasn’t the case last time either.

\- Business relationship is more integrated \~20% of vn's total exports is purely SAMSUNG.

\- Lots of Low cost (\~$150 RT) flights to VN from Low Cost Carriers: T'way, Jeju Air, Jin Air, Air Busan, Fly Gangwon, Air Seoul and we can't forget VietJet + Bamboo routes. Not to mention the full service legacy carriers too!

\- Value--Seafood is also a luxury in KR, but in Da Nang it's a fraction of the price.

\- KR is a younger country than JP, more equipped to cross the  crazy streets of VN.

\- Media: explosion in travel programs, K Dramas, youtubers, tiktoks in KR language coming to VN.

Exports rose an annual 10.6% in the March quarter, accelerating from 7.9% in the final quarter of 2024.
In a note published on Thursday, research firm BMI said the U.S. tariff rate on Vietnam was harsher than expected, and could see GDP growth miss its forecast for this year of 7.4% by up to 3 percentage points.""

So exports grew in March, industrial production grew but missed its projection, and they are thinking they may miss their growth goal of 7.4%.

This was at the request of some US solar manufactures during the **BIDEN** years. Literally says that in the fucking article. I didn’t even vote for Trump, but Jesus Christ, no one reads the articles.

“The duties announced Monday are the culmination of a yearlong trade probe that found solar manufacturers in Cambodia, Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand were unfairly benefiting from government subsidies and selling exports to the US at rates lower than the cost of production. The investigation was sought by domestic solar manufacturers and initiated under former President Joe Biden.”

Yeah sucks for some US solar companies who depend on cheap shit from abroad. But if you’re a US business who makes solar stuff, imagine competing with companies across the ocean whose governments subsidize them to the point they can sell shit *below* cost.

That’s like trying to sell pho when the kid across the street is selling pho, but his parents are covering the costs, so he can charge twice as less as you. You’d fucking complain too.",2025-04-22 10:31:32,3,Odd-Increase2897,VietNam

Ben Thanh Market is a horrible place to shop or eat, it's mafia run and it's all about quick turn around and making money.  I'm not surprised she asked you to move when she had the opportunity to make more money.  I'm not saying it was right or ok, I'm just saying I understand it.
Even after living here for 8 years I still occasionally get overcharged the foreigner tax and it I feel like it's a crazy amount then I walk away.

mkm8myc,1jng5mt,reddit,"I’m a Filipina solo traveler in Vietnam, and I’ve had my fair share of scam experiences. I completely empathize with you—it’s really disappointing to encounter such awful attitudes.

Even in Da Lat, I faced discrimination while trying to buy gold jewelry. The store staff shooed me away like a stray dog and refused to let me buy anything. But when I visited other jewelry stores, they welcomed me with warm smiles, let me try on their pieces, and even opened the door for me when I left—whether I bought anything or not.

Although that kindness didn’t erase the hurt I felt, it reminded me that good people still exist. Afterward, I treated myself to a spa massage and a hair wash. I shared my experience with the spa owner, and she sincerely apologized, saying that, unfortunately, some people just aren’t kind.

At the end of the day, we have to let go of the bad experiences and find comfort in the kindness of others. Some people will mistreat us, but others will help us heal.❤️‍🩹

mkuo904,1jng5mt,reddit,"I’m really sorry to hear about your experience, and I completely agree it’s a terrible thing to encounter while traveling. I’m glad it didn’t ruin your view of Vietnam.

In traditional Vietnamese society, market people are often seen as rough and rude. We use the term “dân chợ búa” to describe someone uncouth or vulgar, so you’re not alone in feeling this way. However, it’s important not to generalise, as some market people are very nice.

To understand why this happens, it’s helpful to know that markets are tough environments, and many vendors are stuck in old business practices. In the past, commerce was more transactional. You’d go to the market, buy what you needed, and the vendor would sell it to you. Vendors competed for your attention, but you also competed with other customers for theirs. The relationship was balanced, slightly favoring the vendors since they had what you needed and you weren’t their only customer. 

Traditionally, vendors had a monopoly on supply and specialized in their trade, like a silk vendor from a silk-specializing village. They didn’t need to treat you like a king unless you were a wealthy repeat customer.

Today, things have changed significantly. We have more variety in goods, and industrialization and automation have reduced monopolies, giving consumers more choices. This is why younger generations are moving away from traditional markets, which are slowly dying out and struggling to adapt.

Regarding whether they were rude to you, the good news is it wasn’t personal or racist. It was purely transactional. They likely behaved that way because you were alone, and the white couple was two people, so they thought the couple would spend more. If the situation were reversed, they probably wouldn’t have moved you for another white person. 

You might also see this with street vendors, where solo diners are sometimes asked to move to accommodate a group. This is very common in Vietnam. 

As for why they were laughing at you, Vietnamese people often laugh in various situations. Older women, in particular, might laugh if they find something amusing, if they find you attractive, or if you’re doing something nice or cute. I don’t think there was any malice intended. Market people are cutthroat and accustomed to a different environment.",2025-04-01 13:21:38,0,Traditional_Tip_8857,VietNam

mmj83u3,1jwl38g,reddit,"In 1010, when king Ly Thai To moved the capital from Hoa Lu to the new capital Thang Long (Hà Nội nowaday), he planned to build a citadel but the citadel collapsed many times. The king sent someone to pray at the Long Do temple and saw a white horse coming out of the temple. The king followed the horse's hoofprints and drew a plan to build the citadel, and the citadel stood firm. The white hourse god was appointed by King Ly Thai To as one of Thánh Hoàng (local god or citadel god) of the capital citadel.

A new capital that will stand firm? Absolutely fit Singapore.

(there are only four citadel god of the capital with their own temple, each on east west south north) the white horse is the temple of the east.

mo47mng,1k3okhq,reddit,"The very first novel I’ve read was “De Men Phieu Luu Ky” - just adventure stories of a cricket. It was easy to read in Vietnamese as I finished it when I was 10 or 12 years old. 

I grew up with “Kinh Van Hoa” - a series of adventures of 3 kids - meeting people, learning new things, solving mystery - they have Scooby Doo vibe, if you know what I mean. Then, a lot of romance novels kinda deep from Nhat Linh and Khai Hung like “Doan tuyet” - still quite true when I was teenager, seeing the conflict between conservative, traditional family lifestyle vs modern life style. 

I also enjoy “Vang bong mot thoi” - not a novel though but like a collection of all hobbies or lifestyles that were once famous. Helped me understand a lot of old traditions. 

Then to war topic there are Sorrow of war and Sympanthizer. For modern novels, I like style of Thuan and Nguyen Ngoc Tu - you can find their most well know novels. My childhood was also filled with books from Nguyen Nhat Anh.",2025-04-20 16:57:52,17,Different_Page8318,VietNam

It's about a fallen noble man's souls got swapped into a radom butcher's body for a second chance of life .

In the end , the soul chose to stay dead because the more he remain in this body , the more corrupted he would be .

  
It's more like a folklore , not a novel , but it show us how much dilemma human have to face in life : the soul want to do noble deed but our body demand earthly desire that should not be ignored . The most profound part of this story is that when the soul confont the body why it is so damn vulgar , the body replied : I have needs too , why are you keep blaming me for my nature when your soul could not exist without a body ? You're speaking of noble deed but when thing not going your way , you shift the blame to the body ? How is it fair ?

mo3x25r,1k3okhq,reddit,"Nguyễn Minh Châu's short story ""Chiếc Thuyền Ngoài Xa"".

If you study it in your school, 90% of you will prob not really understand the metaphor and imagery behind it. The way they teach it doesnt exactly help either when what they mostly say the story is depicting a post-war society still filled with hardships and poverty and that the artists/creators' responsibility is to create works for society and that they should have a multi-positional view.

However, upon diving deeper into it, you start to realize the hidden metaphors Châu is trying to depict at the time. Here are some good examples.

Phùng's boss making unreasonable request forcing him to take photos that should is impossible considering the weather --> Criticising leaders making unreasonable demands and standards workers have to reach

The fisherwoman begging the jury Đẩu to do nothing and the woman not having trust in Đẩu --> Criticising the slow response and the bystanding nature of the juridiction which is just there to be there.

The woman's husband being a former soldier who fought in the war turning to be brutal --> Behind the heroic facade that the Party keeps trying to paint soldiers, they are in the end still humans that can act like douchbags.


The last scene where Phùng keeps being reminded of the fisherwoman whenever he looks at the picture he took, the one that got highly praised by critics and enjoyed by the mass alike --> A reminder for every authors/artists/journalists out there that behind the glamarous society that media depicts, there still always exists a darker side of reality that is hidden away from the normal view and mass.

And this still largely holds true today in Vietnam. Heck not just in Vietnam but also applies to many countries with a broken/authoritarian system. This is why I love this story a lot.

mmvohm1,1jy4pcp,reddit,"Locals are not very keyed into the cultural component of Trumpism. But this is why I can hang out with, and even count among my good friends, a lot of VN people living in VN who are major Trump supporters. I could never see myself having anywhere near as many American friends that are--most of those people wouldn't want to have anything to do with me either, being a black, bisexual, pro-abortion, pro- morphological freedom, anti-religion, vegan, francophone, former American academic living in the EU.

When a non-US based Vietnamese person tells you they like Trump-- especially a person who's not from the west, not an advanced-level speaker of English, and who's seeing him outside the cultural context surrounding him and his worldview-- they're often interpreting/evaluating him through a totally different lens, i.e. 'tough on China', or bling millionaire/""American dream"" type. All the cultural, identity, racial, ""great replacement theory"", ""christian"" when profit dictates, class stuff-- none of that is part of the Trump brand for most of them.

I've found-- and I can admit maybe this is just a foreign perspective-- but I've found Vietnamese people, especially in the south, to be extremely reasonable, educated, open to discourse, and open to having their minds changed by a sensible argument. This is the opposite of Trumpism.

It's why when a lot of these people tell you they are ""for Trump"", it means something different than when an a native born American says the same thing. A Vietnamese person who was not raised in the west who is ""for Trump"" is not buying into the whole MAGA thing, they've mostly just latched onto one or two aspects of the guy that appeal to them.

And it's fair not to expect them to have the same understanding of what Trump means-- the US is another country. Even in incomplete knowledge, they still know a hell of a lot more about US politics than most Americans know about theirs.

And I've found that whenever I've sat down with friends from there and really had 'the Trump talk', mostly they've been like 'shit, well I don't agree with a lot of *that*!'

mlzdosn,1ju1os2,reddit,"Navarro on the Financial Times today telegraphed what they expect Vietnam to do in negotiations:

He wrote:  
""President Trump is always willing to listen.  But to those world leaders who, after decades of cheating, are suddenly offering to lower tariffs––know this: that's just the beginning.

We will want to hear from countries including Cambodia, Mexico, and Vietnam that you will stop allowing China to evade US tariffs by trans-shipping exports through your countries. The far bigger threat lies in the web of non-tariff barriers that continue to choke American industries. And that, too, must end.""

\*\*\*

It worries me that this requested concession isn't more prominent in Vietnam's action plan.  The US is still being unreasonable, but at least they are for perhaps the first time, giving clear directions on what they are seeking in negotiations.

1) cook outside, especially for the stronger smelling dishes. We have a patio stove that we use to cook fish and other dishes with strong smells 
2) install a strong vent hood that goes to the outside of the house instead of recirculating 
3) if the two above isn't possible use really good air filters. What's likely happening is your return air intake is sucking up some of the cooking smells and blowing it all over the house. This is especially true if it's near the kitchen.",2025-04-14 14:07:07,1,Appropriate-Run748,VietNam

Personally I’m Japanese Mexican American, but growing up in California I was extremely fortunate since there were so many other Asian Americans like Korean, Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese etc. I never had to worry about my experiences growing up because they would always be validated by community, but I know Asian Americans in the middle states have a much tougher time and don’t have that luxury. But I know how you feel as well because since moving to Japan, it feels like they will never accept you no matter how perfect you are. Personally I don’t think you’re being over sensitive, at the end of the day you just have to remember you are YOU and that’s all that really matters. Additionally this is also an issue many diaspora face, so you’re not alone. People are generally not the smartest when it comes to identities. They will make up their mind of who you are before they get to know you, and apparently the concept that someone can be more than two things at the same time is somehow difficult for people to understand (not sure why tho). In the end I would guess they’re treating you differently because of discrimination against diaspora/multicultural people (although I’m not sure enough of the cultural landscape of Vietnam to say this is accurate).

mojajk3,1k50xme,reddit,"If you're curious, I recently asked Deep Research to do a breakdown of whether or not Vietnam is in a housing bubble. It's a bit of a read, but super informative:  
[https://chatgpt.com/share/6808421a-a988-800d-abec-5c2aabf4e698](https://chatgpt.com/share/6808421a-a988-800d-abec-5c2aabf4e698)

In short, a house in Vietnam currently costs more than 60x the annual salary of the average city resident (so, excluding farming communities, etc). If you buy a house, it takes the average well-paid citizen 60 years of income to pay it off. That's nearly double the 30x generally considered healthy. There's a huge over supply of luxury developments, and a huge undersupply of affordable housing. But because of the way that the luxury condos are financed, owners can't lower their prices without triggering default, so they sit empty - hence the large ghost development projects that have no people buying them, but are still very expensive.

Anyway, I thought the analysis was an interesting read.",2025-04-23 01:31:36,2,BitBurned,VietNam

mmrxfjw,1juxhvu,reddit,"I made a post about Ha Long Bay that popped off so I won’t be surprised if this is a response to me. Nonetheless, here is my response to you:

Overtourism isn’t JUST about litter in the water. There are plenty of other adverse impacts. I outlined those in replies to people under my post but I’ll lay them out here for you.

1. Environmental Degradation:
- Boat traffic stirs up sediment, damages coral and seagrass beds, and causes shoreline erosion. It isn’t as though there are just a few boats. There are only boats as far as the eye can see. 
- Anchoring can destroy fragile underwater ecosystems. Again, this is happening at a large scale.
-  Foot traffic from tourists tramples vegetation, erodes trails, and damages habitats on nearby islands. I remember the island we went hiking on. There were tourists lined up to go to the top of the hill. The line barely moved. If that’s not over-tourism, I don’t know what is.

2. Wildlife Disruption
- Noise from boats and large crowds stresses wildlife, disrupts breeding, and can force species to flee their natural habitats.
- Feeding or approaching animals alters their natural behavior and can lead to long-term ecological imbalances.
- Increased litter and human presence attract invasive species and pests.

3. Water & Air Pollution
- Fuel spills, waste discharge, and sunscreen chemicals pollute the water, harming marine life.
- Diesel engines on boats emit CO₂, NOx, and fine particulates, contributing to air pollution and degrading air quality for locals and wildlife alike.

4. Waste Management Overload
- Local infrastructure often can’t handle the sheer volume of waste, leading to garbage in the water, on trails, and in otherwise pristine areas. This, again, isn’t just about the litter in the water but also the inability of the town to handle waste.

Ha Long Bay is a UNESCO world heritage site. I’ve visited many such sites across the world and this one was of of the most abysmal in terms of how it’s taken care of. I don’t believe there is any *sustainable* limit on the number of tourists. What is the daily limit anyway? Other places enforce a limit. Why don’t you? And no, it’s not about buying a ticket to access it lol. Yes, we know tickets need to be bought. But what’s the limit? 

Even if there was 0 litter in the water, everything he said above applies. You have to realize that the stakes are higher for such a valuable, beautiful piece of nature. A lot of the damage will be irreversible. Tourism eventually will dry up too, and honestly it should. The bay should be given a chance to heal and regenerate.

Lastly, I’m no expert on this but I personally felt bad for the floating fisherman villages. They had a whole lifestyle and culture and it’s been dismantled for the purpose of outsiders (tourists). Everyone can blame them all you want for the trash but why didn’t the government work with them and figure out a solution for the trash? It’s not like that’s the only community that’s littering. This is a problem all over Vietnam.",2025-04-12 18:44:36,1,Empty_Try8500,VietNam

I am beyond sick of the banking stuff every time my TRC expires, and my last two TRCs have only been 18 months because of some stuff with my employer and their own license. When I came here, TRCs were three years and could be extended.


Also completely sick of driving licenses being tied to TRCs. This basically guarantees you won't have a license for a couple of weeks even if you do everything perfectly. Having to provide a medical is sort of understandable, but why does converting a foreign license require proof of where you live from your local police? I am in a police station converting a license, and have to go to another police station to get this document, when it is completely irrelevant and they could just look it up in the database themselves. Mindless pointless bureaucracy.


There are still enormous shortcomings in all of the work stuff. An employer can cancel your WP and TRC without even telling you and just land you in a world of hurt. Why don't we get a letter or an SMS when our status changes, when it is out of our hands completely? We are supposed to have worker rights but are given like 1-2 weeks to leave the country even if we've been here decades.



It is a country that deep down doesn't think we should have any semblance of equal rights. Even Vietnamese people who like foreigners etc. don't actually think we should be able to get the same rights that they would get in our countries.

Fortunately I'm getting married this year, but if I wasn't I'd strongly consider switched nationalities (I'm a UK citizen and I want to live in VN long term) as it's become so hard.

Personally I would say major English centres like ILA or Apollo are worth their weight in gold in terms of visas, work permits, and residence cards. If you work for another company that sponsors you it really is hit and miss, especially with regard to them paying the correct taxes and social security.

The new tax system is also quite harsh, I'm taxed 20% and have to pay social security for a salary that wouldn't even be considered minimum wage back in my home country. Of course cash in hand jobs still exist, but finding reliable long term ones is a huge challenge. You have to jump through a lot of hoops with paperwork with regard to permits and dealing with an incredibly hostile immigration system. In general the hectic nature of life can also wear you down.

  
All that being said, I've chosen this life, and I absolutely love it. Wouldn't trade it for anything. In fact, someone asked me the other day what I would do if I won the lottery and I answered that if I did I'd probably just do exactly what I'm doing now. You have to put a lot in, but overall you get much more out.

  
For me life got a lot easier after 4 or 5 years when I became much more comfortable speaking and listening in Vietnamese. My gf doesn't speak any English so just communicating in Vietnamese all the time really helped me to integrate into society here. I would also like to point out that when I came here I came with the intention of integrating. I grew up in a very multicultural area of Bristol that had lots of Somali immigrants who refused to learn English or follow English customs (So I was determined that when I moved to VN I would behave how I wish foreigners in England would behave). In addition, there were lots of white middle class people in my city who were such full of shit, think Tây Ba Lô types, that I refused to live or hangout in West Lake when I arrived as the vibe there reminded me a lot of Stokes Croft in Bristol.

Is it getting more difficult? Yes. Quite frankly most of the region is putting blocks on illegal immigration. By that I mean visa runners, overstayers who work in the lowest level jobs without paperwork. Why? Well why do the west do it? Stop people becoming a burden, keep population under control, manage quality, crime, taxes etc. 

The banking should and could be loser, it has lost the country some big investors over the years but hey that's not my problem I wouldn't have seen a penny of that. 

As for legal processes, there is a lot of infighting in the powers that be these days. Provinces have basically taken too much control and while some are semi competent others are super corrupt and if they feel a task is too hard won't do it. 

Hanoi to me was never a friendly city. Ho Chi Minh and southern cities now overrun/controlled by northerners also unfriendly. But also times are getting hard for the Vietnamese. They won't admit it but the days where you could open a business and make a mint have gone away. 

Now it's likely due to rent or expenses being higher your business will be devoured. If that doesn't get you someone with deeper pockets and better connections will. 

So the cities represent the unfriendly nature of the developed world. Miserable, expensive for locals and overpopulated. But hey that's what they wanted.

mlswa85,1jrzfch,reddit,"It’s an exaggeration. If they learnt it by heart 3000 lines, there would be a lot of variations for popular sentences, officially and unofficially. Also, Tale of Kieu or “Truyện Kiều” was based on one of Chinese Literature called “Kim Vân Kiều Truyện” or “Kim Vân Truyện” from Chinese Author named “青心才人” or “Thanh Tâm Tài Nhân” had lived in Ming Dynasty. Nguyen Du utilized the base story but changed it whenever he saw fit.
 
I learned it back in high school and mind you, neither of my literature teacher nor our literature textbook says a single word about the reciting of 3000 lines. Unlike the history setting of Western World or Medieval Europe, in East Asian social setting, it doesn’t cost much to go to school and learn how to read and write, the real cost of reading and writing come from paper and ink, and there were printing-press but not so much going on, so you would need to pay for the scribe if you live in some remote area and want to read a literature.

It seems to me there is a trend when people find it’s cool to tell a story about an oral tradition that has been passing through generations, that preserves word by word, dot by dot, sentence by sentence. Like the Oral Traditions that would eventually became Talmud and Quran because there are too many variations, even scholars couldn’t agree with each others so they canonized it. The story about fucking unbroken telephone. It’s fucking lame and corny if you ask me. 

Let’s just treat things like this like how you could tell a tourist attration legit or not. Ask the local, if they know about the location, it’s legitimate or at least has something going on.

So here's some guideline for you to survive with 400USD/months \~ around 10 million VND so you can still have money to do everything else.

10M/months are around 1 freshly graduated - junior office income here and most Vietnamese in big cities from 22-26 are earning this amount and live perfectly alone, so you should too.

Firstly, you should stay in big cities like Saigon, Hanoi, Danang or a tourist attraction place, it's more pricey but you'll manage. You can live in rural provinces for the cheapest options., but your life will be hell and nobody around you will speak English so I won't recommend it.

I live in Vinhomes Grand Park Saigon, there's a pretty good balance of foreigner and locals here, the prices below are what I spend as well.

For rent, if you want some comfort, you can find an affordable studio around 4 million, with electricity, internet and every other household bill it would cost up to total around 5.5 million.

Or, you can live in a sleepbox, renting room(phòng trọ). it can cost as cheap as 2 to 2.5 million.

Let's say you live in a studio in Vinhomes, now you have around 4 to 4.5 million left to spend on food and everything.

You can eat out everyday, here's some average prices per food you can select.

Banh Mi/Banh Cuon and many other light breakfasts - 20k-25k

Pho/Bun Bo/Com Tam 35k-40k-45k

So if you ear reallly fancy it can take upo to 120k/day. mutliply it with 30days is equal to 3.6M. and you still have around 1-1.5 millions left to have fun, buy clothes, go gym things, explore, etc.

But you can still save much more money if you decide to cook. For example 1kg of chicken breast here is 80k VND.",2025-04-08 17:45:49,25,Undersword,VietNam

mm2x75i,1jugrn7,reddit,"That's 666 dollar per month, more than the average salary. So yes you can. Fly to hanoi or ho chi minh city and then go to the edges of the city (or nearby small city). Hotels will be super cheap (I've seen decent places for 12-15 usd per night)  and local food will also be cheap (30-50k for a meal, 1.2 - 2 usd). Then once a while get something more expensive like a buffet at Dookki for 139k. To get a bunch of different tastes ^^

Hotel will have the wifi which you can use for online stuff, just expect some lagging in games in some of the hotels lol.

Take a grab taxi outside of rush hours to go to nearby attractions, or take a cheap bus (use 12go asia) to other cities for trips. 

For laundry, hotels usually charge a lot, and even cleaners who do it for you will charge 1-2 dollar per kg. So you can look for a 24/7 laundromat where you just do it yourself. Thats the cheapest if you really are just pinching dollars (besides doing it in the hotel sink lol).

I would suggest to do 2-4 months vietnam 1-2 months cambodia 1-2 months laos. Those 2 are even cheaper than Vietnam but also more poor so won't be as much to visit. 

You can still be a sightseeing tourist tbh, you dont need to lock urself in a hotel for 6 months. however getting guided tours is expensive in laos especially and a bit more in cambodia. In vietnam guided tours are cheaper (maybe more competition?). 

Transport from city to city in sleeper busses that drive overnight so you dont have to pay hotel for that day. Use a backpack not a suitcase. Get sim cards in each separate country for when u don't have hotel wifi.",2025-04-08 18:49:14,4,BelgianDudeInDenmark,VietNam

mm29el2,1jugrn7,reddit,"As a Canadian who lived in Vietnam for 5months. $4000USD is actually doable as long as you’re not doing anything crazy or living in the most fanciest of places I say go for it! You can always negotiate rates with those who are renting especially since you’re staying long term 6 months supposedly.

Food is cheap Ive gotten by only spending around 6USD on food for both Lunch and Dinner (this can be either cheaper or more expensive, depends what you eat and where you eat). Travelling is not that expensive either. However, as a foreigner its best to stay in district 1  or at least 10-15mins away from D1 since there are more English speaking locals and a lot more foreigners. But avoid going to touristy restaurants as you’ll get ripped off or overcharged. 

You will also probably need to do a Visa run at least once during your trip since Vietnamese visa only allows up to 90 days maximum. All you need to do is fly out and fly back in the country or go to Cambodia which is closer and can take a bus and then come back in the country. (This can be done same day). Me and my gf literally entered for just 30mins and turned back around to Vietnam.

Anyways first step would be to find a place that is cheap. I realized a lot of people renting out their apartments on Booking .com or Agoda. They are willing to cancel the book and deal with you in person once they see you and workout a deal for a longer stay. 

Travel and getting around in Vietnam is very easy. The moment you get out of the airport Just need to use GRAB (Uber for asia), you can book a scooter or car. I realized going from one side of the city to another which was like a 45min scooter ride with GRAB was only $3-4! Grab scooter would always be the most cost efficient and time efficient method. 

Food is relatively cheap you can always find the most freshes food. Also I realized the more run down the place looks the better the food vs those fancy restaurants. I think those are the type of places where I enjoyed food the most. Street food is good just avoid fresh veggies or ice.

First, 4kUSD ~ 100milVND is definitely enough for 6 months (slightly more 16milVND/month) in Vietnam but there's a few factors to consider
- First, you should know Vietnamese. It could be difficult but it'd be best if you can find a trustworthy VNese helping you with the rent. Most landlords advertises their properties on facebook, which will be much cheaper than the agents, but some may be scam.
- If possible, avoid big cities like HCM or Ha Noi. Da Nang or Nha Trang could be a good option. Even better, other city beside those three but again, I dont think many people speaking English there. You can try other popular but not too tourisic: Hai Phong, Quang Ngai, ...
- Cook your food if possible. Even though meals can be bought for cheap, it'll be cheaper if you can cook for yourself. There're plenty of fresh ingridients in markets or supermarkets
- Rent a motobike for moving around if you have a license. Using Grab or taxi too much will burn your wallet faster than you think. Otherwise, use public transport when it's accessible.
Those are what come to my mind. Your experience could be vary but generally, Vietnam is safe, there're no major crimes, just petty theft and scams, nothing new in SEA. You can always use GG translate as an option. Good luck OP!",2025-04-08 19:11:41,2,ChrisDanh,VietNam

I literally sweat the second I step out of the shower. I couldn't care less about what they say, just smile and move on. I only see them 2 weeks every few years. Why would I worried about what they say when I dont really live with them? Why would I dress uncomfortably or wear brand names clothes to please people I barely see or know? 

I saw people spending money on clothes to dress like ""Vietkieu"" when they do back to Vietnam. They don;t want people to look down on them. I personally do what I like because I don't care about them.

Sometimes they really are just teasing. I know, it's a horrible way to make conversation, but if your family is similar to mine, this is just how they learned how to talk to each other. The way to tell to me is 1, whether they are smiling, and 2, whether they say similar stuffs to other people in the family. If it really is this, join in on the joke, start teasing others.

If they really mean those criticisms, I have always done 1 of 2 things (or both): dig deep into what they are saying, keep asking why to make them commit to saying something terrible or redirect the insult/criticism to some other ""respected"" member of the family. Some examples of that with what have been said to me:

1. Digging: Them: ""Don't date foreigners."" Me: ""Oh, why?"" Them: ""They don't understand the culture"". Me: ""Which part of the culture? I can teach them."". Them: ""No, foreigners are proud. They are difficult (khó bảo)."" Me: ""So I should only look for people that are not proud and easy to control? Is auntie easy for you to control?"" .... blah blah
2. Redirection: Them: ""Don't eat so much. You're already overweight."" Me: ""Oh, I'm just learning from uncle B...""

Criticizing everything is a bad habit of many Vietnamese. As soon as they speak a word, it can be a criticism about whatever they see or think about. But as others told you, you really have to ignore them. Believe, sometimes people dont really know about what they are criticizing. Or they dont really think so, they just follow a trend of criticizing you

All you need to do is just listen - or at least just pretend to ""hear"". You just stay here for a while every 5 years, so try a little more. Pretend that you agree with them, pretend that you're doing as they advise, etc.. Nod your head, keep saying that ""yes, im trying/i've already done that..."" - just to satisfy them a bit

1. Read “Let Them” by Mel Robbins. TLDR: basically people can behave however they want, but you choose how you respond.

2. If your acne is bothering you, your GP can get you some prescription medication. This will help you feel less self conscious about it. 

3. With regard to your relatives being unkind, become Teflon. Whenever they say or do something that that bothers you, just let it bounce off. Smile politely, have a non committal answer like ‘mhmm’, or ‘I’m sorry you feel that way, I’m happy with how I am/how my life is right now.’ Don’t engage, and don’t let their comments affect you. They can choose to have an opinion, it doesn’t mean it is correct. You can choose to let it affect you, or ignore it.

Families can be tough to navigate, even more so when they have different cultures. What I’ve learned is that no matter how much you want someone to be a certain way, you can’t change them. Your only choice is to accept them for who they are right now. If you can’t deal with that then distance yourself. They are not going to change. It’s up to you to decide the kind of relationship you can have with them.

What I've come to realise is Vietnamese culture is to be extremely direct, anything they notice they tell you not to embarrass you but to make sure you know. To us western culture these things aren't usually said because they come across as embarrassing and nasty to say, but their perspective on it is behind ""helpful"". 

My advice: change your perspective. When in Vietnam tell yourself that anything they say is just very basic advice. Then when you get back, forget it all. Every time a family member says anything wait 5 seconds to reply so there's a bit of silence, then say thank you.

I often have found I people please too much, I read the book: ""courage to be disliked"". This helped a lot to deal with this, no idea if you have this problem, but if you do then consider the read.

She said when they comment on her body that translates to them wanting to make sure she’s eating well and keeping her health in check. when they berate her about things they usually have underlying meanings that they can’t express well or atleast empathetically. so she learned to not take them to heart and to be able to kinda decipher what they actually mean.",2025-03-30 10:27:11,1,Throwahwee,VietNam

mklilrr,1jn1im1,reddit,"Haha that sounds about right. My relatives are the same way. I'm married with no kids so you can tell how much shit I get whenever I visit. This is a long comment since this is so close to home for me. 

I've tried many methods: 1 talking back, 2 stay silent, 3 cry in front of them, 4 go to someone with the voice in the family and complain to them (get the gossip going) since they care a lot about what other people think, 5 go along with what they say as if you're agreeing with them (older generations don't understand sarcasm), and 6 be sassy with whoever the fuck talk shit to you no matter the hierarchy. Here's what I've learned:

  
1. talking back: This one can get backfired really quickly lmao. Like you said, they will say that you're being disrespectful to elders and need to stay in line even though they were the ones that started. So I get you on that. However, I've seen some of my friends done it, together with 6. being sassy. but you have to choose your battles and what to say. For ex: My friend who gained weight over the years started getting criticisms on it and constantly too. She stayed silent for a while and one day got really irritated and said ""Well I've never eaten your food so you don't have to be so afraid!"". This response was said in front of everyone loud and clear. This sent a message to everyone to stfu about that topic, also signaled that she wouldn't let them bully her so think twice bf talking shit, and make her uncle look bad because it sounds like he's afraid she'll eat his food.  Soooo if you can say something with multiple effects like that, they'll shut up. 

2. Stay silent: Sometimes you just have to let it go to keep the peace, can't go on combat mode all the time. It's exhausting BUT you can display your disagreeing emotions while being silent. 

3. I've exploded and cried in front of them before in front of everyone too. My oldest aunt had to come to me the next day and tried to console me by something like ""oh your uncle said that because he cares"". Now thinking back, I regret exploding in front of them bc bullies don't change, not in my case at least.

4. I've went straight to someone in the family and started to complain. The gossip spread so fast and surprisingly was effective. Like i said, Vnese people care about what other people say about them so hit them where it hurts (=> spread the shit talk).

5. Go along: This is honestly the most effective I've seen. If they tell you to get married you say ""Yes absolutely just prepare your red envelop, you'll eat at my wedding by the year's end"". Though what year's end, you never said. This way they will laugh and the topic will change. 

6. Being sassy: Lol I have a few sassy friends they talk back and shit talk about the relatives they don't like all the time and they don't give a shit! This method certainly works cos older aunties and uncles are humans too and if they're bullies they're also cowards. And if you can step up and talk shit back like you don't give a damn, no one will mess with you. Keep in mind though, they might not respect you but will fear you.",2025-03-30 23:01:22,1,Puzzleheaded_Loan_66,VietNam

Coffee: we're like number 2 or 3 exporter of coffee, so possibly a part of the coffee the world drinks come from Vietnam.

In Vietnam and China, we've also had this historical problem where men steal the households' money to gamble or give money to mistresses. In China, they have slightly different norm where they want the guy to pay a large sum of money and sign over house and car deeds at the outset of the marriage. That way, should anything happens to the marriage, the wife and children have a soft landing. Now, your marriage might not end up like that, but you gotta convince your wife that you're dependable.

While the men would go out murdering other men whose wives would do the same. But we have had lots of time to evolve from that barbarian life style.

mmvkayj,1jy3fee,reddit,"Tried that for 5 years after marrying, it didn't work at all. Once my business picked up and I had full control over the business account, we were fine. You need to be firm.

 For 5 years, we were somehow spending 90tr a month (whilst not even paying rent as we inherited her family's second home), living paycheck to paycheck. Shippers arriving at the house several times a day, expensive life insurance policies for ourselves (my wife had 2 life insurance policies) and family members, any expensive purchases made on the credit card so we could ""save money"".... it was an absolute joke. 

Eventually, I turned around to my wife and said we needed to go through our finances transparently. It was horrendously mismanaged. As she had never lived alone, had zero independence before marrying me, and had no formal education in money management, she completely ruined us for years. One month, she spent 24tr on Shopee and Grab, and we paid around 15tr interest alone on a credit card... 

Skip forward to 10 years married, and I now give her an allowance. 20% of our earnings go on stocks and investments, we don't spoon feed her family insurance policies, we rebuilt our home from the ground up, we drive a nice car, our kids go to a nice international school, and I have full control over our business account and finances. 

If your wife wants to manage the money, trial run it for a year or so. There are loads of expenses after marriage, so don't expect results immediately. If it's working out well, continue. If there are red flags, be firm. Whatever you dl, don't wait so many years if it isn't working to discuss it. The stress and strain on our relationship ate me up for ages.

Once labour cost goes up, Samsung will relocate to a different country again. The Vietnamese people and Vietnam’s future isn’t a priority for Samsung, it’s the cheap labour and profit margins that matters more as per evidence. 

Literally, “Vietnams development is intertwined with Samsung. When Vietnam succeeds, Samsung Succeeds” is so dystopian to read. It’s sad. This is not something to celebrate. It’s not a victory for Vietnam to be in such a predicament. 

We don’t even know how much influence this conglomerate has over the VCP leaderships either. But I’m willing to bet, a lot of favourable concessions were made cuz some VCP member got some nice pocket money. 

Going forward, I really hope the VCP leadership will work on reducing the market share that Samsungs has on Vietnams economy. 

They should really invest and support native tech and other private Vietnamese businesses to help them grow and be more competent so they can help out too. 

I’m not against Samsung investing in Vietnam, I’m against how much power Samsung has in Vietnam. I would love to see Vietnamese enterprises contribution go the economy grow so we can reduce our reliance on Samsung and other foreign businesses.

According to Chinese, everyone else is lazy apart from them. They have similar stories from Pakistan and Africa. An average factory worker in China earns 3000rmb. When the same factory relocates to Vietnam, a worker doing the same job is paid 500rmb or less. In Africa this can go as low as 100rmb or less.

Reason they give: We pay according to local labour market. Which maybe fine but they expect the same output from both workers in China and Vietnam with such abnormal disparities in salary.

Another issue is about culture. An average Chinese is ""Born to work"". Chinese work until death. In China you find grannies and grandpas doing casual work on construction sites.

They work just enough to get by. They will always choose the easy route, and it might involve cheating the system. Look at how they drive.

In all offices, people never stay one minute past the end of the day. They are gone as soon as possible. And they never aim for perfection. Their work is often mediocre. Look at the houses: doors are not straight, painting is sketchy, etc, etc... 

Or look at the quality of service in the average restaurants, shops, etc. They have no standards. They don't smile, they are inattentive, they get the order or bill wrong, they spend their time on the phone, etc. If there isn't a manager to look after them and keep them on their toes, they're doing the very least they need to.

 If you've worked with Japanese or Koreans, you'll see a stark difference in time spent and quality. And Chinese are no different. They are much more serious and professional than Vietnamese.

I've experienced it working in VN whether it be in IT, tech, F&B, or food manufacturing. And it's a big problem for competitivity in Vietnam. 

This problem mainly comes from education and culture. School tech them to be yes men and follow orders, not taking any initiatives. That's why Vietnam is so uncreative and nobody wants to take responsabilities.

Who is driving change in working culture? Foreign companies. Pizza 4P's is a prime example in F&B. They have set the standard in Vietnam.

mowv2sj,1k71392,reddit,"This is bullshit. 💩

I work in the electronics industry for a manufacturer - costs are NOT lower for engineering talent compared with China, they're roughly the same.

The big difference is what you get - Vietnam engineers are superior to what you find in China by a factor of 3-4 times. They are smarter, more autonomous, and more innovative. The bigger problem in China is they struggle to go beyond what you tell them to do and don't think outside of the box.

Vietnam struggles with logistics (and costs), limited resources pool and a disorganised out of touch government.

Vietnam is also way superior for software development than China.

China's engineering talent hasn't ever been superb, they've spent almost 40 years being shown what to do and they still can't do the basics themselves. Just look at electronics components, there's no Chinese manufacturers of decent, reliable  capacitors, resistors, transistors, diodes, transformers, semiconductors etc, let alone class leading. All decent electronics manufacturered (err, assembled) in China by foreign companies utilises 95%+ foreign components - it's the reason it's so easy to move production from China to elsewhere. China only wins in terms of scale and well established supply chain logistics. If you're a boutique or small scale electronics manufacturer, China offer zero advantage to manufacture and in fact, you're more likely to get shafted and your IP ripped off and copied.

Chinese owned subcontract manufacturers are mostly dodgy as fuck - they'll shaft you whenever they think it's more financially advantageous for them - it's why most foreign companies do NOT use China owned companies to do their manufacturing, preferring Taiwanese & Hong Kong owned companies which have been around since the 70's & 80's such as GP, V-Tech, Compal, Pegatron, Hon Hai Precision, Wistron etc.

There are many factors which location in Asia is best as there's pros and cons, but certainly for small to medium manufacturers, China is a BAD place to manufacture due to the likelihood you'll get fucked over.

Taiwan, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines & Indonesia offer much better alternatives with the best places being 1. Taiwan 2. Malaysia 3. Vietnam for smaller scale manufacturers.",2025-04-25 03:42:57,5,AV-Guy_In_Asia,VietNam
moum8x7,1k71392,reddit,"The typical way to solve the local worker low-efficiency issue is to hire several Chinese workers as team leader for each manufacturing process. Let them train and monitor the local workers. Gradually fire the slackers and keep the hard working people (material bonus is important too.) Finally for the Chinese workers, they can either move up (to quality control (relatively less labor intensive) or mid-management) or jump ship / return to China. The efficiency issue is annoying for new factories, but all established factories have resolved it already. 

For the supply chain, unfortunately Vietnam still needs to import lots of components from China, from steel and aluminum profiles to electronics (motor, IC, etc.). Unless VN government charges heavy tariff on all Chinese import, there won't be drastic change in the manufacturing industries.

Imagine having to work for 12 hours 29 to 30 days a month inside a hot, enclosed factory because that's the best way to support your family. 

Then your family if they live with you still has to live in a one room hovel with no ventilation. The school fees are up, the prices are up. In essence that money that you've come to make often to help elderly relatives is eaten up and life is miserable. 

There's little in the way of promotion too if you don't have a degree. It's not like the west where you could go from floor scrubber to CEO. Vietnam and the east have huge caste system style social barriers. In the UK for example I can go in a pub and end up having a drink with a shop clerk to a bank manger. That doesn't exist here. Heck to outsiders a lot of Vietnamese basically deny that those class of people exist instead telling us that everyone has a car and property or they outright CHOOSE to live and dress like that, they think we're idiots on the outside!

So, to expect people to go through this and not put a half arsed job in is ridiculous. I haven't even talked about the abusive managers, lack of training or how because of all this the shelf life of a factory worker is very low, sub 3 years before they head to somewhere else.

It meant that in the future, Starlink can be use by national airlines such as Vietnam Airlines or Vietjet to provide in-flights Wifi for national and internation flights. 

The government may also use it as a way to avoid the tariff.

I worked in one of these ""international"" schools, one of those which has both countries in its name and which boasts of celebrating/respecting both cultures.

I never once saw a list of student names written in Vietnamese. Only the standard western roman alphabet. No đ, no â,ê, ă, ơ, ư and of course, no tones. So, even those staff who are trying to learn Vietnamese have no idea how to pronounce them.

Does it matter? Of course it does. I met a kid in Y10 for a cover class. When reading the register I hesitated then said ""I'm going to guess this is ""Yung"" right?""  I got a big smile in return and he told me how sick he was of his foreign teachers calling hin ""dung"" - well aware of what it means in English.

It's ignorance, pure and simple. How hard would it be to print a list of names in Vietnamese characters and to give new staff rudimentary lesons in how to pronounce them?

Not even enough respect for the kids and their parents to care about getting their names right.

Hi, I'm a Northern Vietnamese, but I have many Viet Kieu friends online! I just want to share my explanation based on my experience.

I guess most of the people you asked must be adults (maybe over 30?). If that’s the case, then I can say that this generation often has friends, family, or even themselves who were involved in the Vietnam War, especially those from the North (If you've read about Vietnamese history, you might understand). Of course, blaming innocent people is negative, but there's often some prejudice and resentment in their attitude, which is somewhat understandable. On the bright side, it shows how much Vietnamese people respect older generations. Empathy should come from both sides.

I know you might feel disappointed about the prejudice against Viet Kieu, but don’t worry, many young people today are more open-minded. They might still be a little conservative when it comes to politics, but they won’t reject cool friends 😋😋😋",2025-04-07 17:38:07,3,meRyrylielafw97,VietNam

I was in dire need of this paperwork to be processed come back all tensed and nervous begging them (as I’m nervous my northern accent came out by accident), I saw their whole demeanor changed as soon as my northern accent came out.

They think it's better for them just to be able to belittle someone even just in the smallest things, this can be due to their lack of education but thinking that they are better cause of certain jobs, like an ego thing.

This is NOT a representative of all Northerners, it is sadly that job hierarchy is still part of Vietnamese Culture and sometimes people say things to you thinking you wouldn't understand. Actually it was one of the first benefits my friend mentioned when we studied in the UK - that we can talk about others in a language they cannot understand. It's backward of course but there are good and bad people everywhere.

I have actually met Southerners in the UK who was rude to me because I am a Notherner. But as Northerners we are not really educated on the division and the fallout of the War. Only after I started working in research reading papers by scholars like Phi Hong Su, it open my eyes to certain perceptions of Southerners vs. Northerners.

Good:

Motorbikes & transport are fun, cheap, and easy

Affordable, delicious food everywhere

Relaxed rules, minimal tipping culture

Clean streets (no homelessness/drugs)

Friendly locals, eager to speak English

Great customer service


Neutral:

Hanoi = fun chaos

Traffic is wild

“Luxury” often just means average

No table bussing


Bad:

Major litter/trash issues, even in nature spots

Over-tourism + overdevelopment ruining authenticity

No posted prices = frequent haggling

Dirty bathrooms, pushy vendors

Btw be careful when riding a motorbike in Vietnam.  A few months ago the Vietnamese government increased traffic penalties very significantly.  Penalties are now hundreds to thousands of dollars or even confiscation of your motorbike.  Having 500k in your wallet to get around traffic laws doesn't cut it anymore.


Traffic police is more noticeable at least in HCMC.  And people are responding because I see much much less driving on the sidewalks.  The government is trying to make HCMC more walkable, they're actually digging up old sidewalks, widening and retiling them.  Stricter penalties for riding a motorbike on the sidewalk is part of that strategy of making HCMC more walkable.",2025-04-24 11:44:40,3,xmod3563,VietNam

mmpufxn,1jxdkzg,reddit,"Yesterday some dude on here suggested that ""Trump is a manchild"" and ""he gonna fold once inflation hit US"" so Vietnam just need to wait for the orange man to pushback. I wrote a comment but busy and didn't send it, so i repost this here again:





The tariffs in effect in 8/4, while he announced it in 5/4, after just three days.                  







So let's say, an US importer import from a Vietnamese manufacturer a particular product and sell it in the US market through retail chain. With the FOB price of the product, meaning that includes manufacturing cost and transportation costs, export taxes, when the products sitting at the Vietnamese port, Vietnamese manufacturers have 20% profits margin at that price. Meanwhile, US importer, after the shipping cost of the product to US, duty fee, tax( if have), VAT,  to retail chain to the hand of end customers, their profits margin is also 20%.           






Now, if the tariffs is 46%, literally, every product that importer bring to US and sell at the same price, they would sell at a loss because the tariffs is higher than their profits margin. If they rise price, people would buy it less or find alternative, it's called market elasticity. In reality they would be very hesitant to raise the price of the products, because it shoo away loyal customers base, especially if there's an alternative brand( just imagine what happens if Cocacola raise price compared to pepsi).       







So what the US importer should do? Find an alternative supplier from country with less tariffs? Unfortunately finding alternative manufacturers is not easy like upvote and downvote on Reddit. You have to look for their FOB price compared to the old one, see their quality, reputation, secure payment, local taxes and paperwork. Then find shipping companies for that route. It take times, and a lot of money. Or they can withhold the product in the Vietnamese ports, wait to see how things fold out to change accordingly. 





Oh, so they're keeping the containers in the port. But that cost money, to rent land plots and maintain the product itself. This is very nasty, especially for goods that can't keep long like agriculture products, especially fruits and vegetables. It's because they need to keep cool to maintain the fresh (which cost money to run refrigeration), and even then, they will gradually losing their freshness. On the news you hear ""Dưa hấu giải cứu"" ""Mít giải cứu"", it is just basically Vietnamese fruits and vegetables, get turned back by importers so they selling it to domestic consumers at discounted price. The clearest example you can see is during Covid, when China temporarily halt Vietnam goods cross border because they find virus on Vietnamese fishes. Around 5000 containers stuck daily on Laocai border, truckers have to run AC to keep the fruits fresh which cost 2-5m vnd per day.




With profits margin of 20%. Let's say, a container worth of good is 500m vnd. If they need 2m vnd per day to maintain the container, if it's not shipped for 50  plus days, the manufacturer would be at profit loss for that container. And if it's goods such as vegetables, fruits, meat, the cost to maintain even higher and the time they can hold even shorter before the whole thing go bad. For the small-middle size businesses, with limited capital. Each month, they have to pay land rent, workers wage, bank interests, electric bills...If the products are not shipped to get money back for circulation, they will bankrupt soon. 





And it's just short-middle term. In long term, what scary is the uncertainty. US market related companies, maybe back in the past they find Vietnam is a good place to replace China to avoid trade war, now see that Vietnam can also in the list of Trump, they would want to divert the supply chain partly away from Vietnam to avoid a situation like this happen. [This article about how much fashion companies hit by this and they're thinking about reduce supply chain in Vietnam](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2025/04/02/trump-tariffs-on-vietnam-could-raise-prices-for-shoes-furniture-toys.html)





Vietnam has hundreds of thousands export oriented firms. 40% in there related to US market. Many of them specifically established to serve US market. If companies reduce operations in Vietnam, many of them would go out of business. Mass layoffs, high unemployment> people don't have money to spend> consumption drop> businesses stop expand or reduce operations> even more layoffs. A vicious cycle that could push Vietnam into recession. 





That's why you see, General secretary, PM, vice PM, all have to immediately go to US to negotiate. People on this sub who keep chanting ""Vietnam bend the knee and kiss the rings"" are people who are not directly affected by this, and the economic downturn wave have not hit them yet, so they can talk like that.

No one was ever kind to their grandparents. Their parents may have received a bit and now the young generation is modernizing with courtesy.

Chinese (or Vietnamese) tourists aren't the best when they travelled oversea. But American tourists don't have the best reputation in the world either. And some of Western expats were having the worst rep amongst Western tourists in Vietnam. South Korean tourists too.

Do European and US and Korea all have the lack of emphasis on courtesy and empathy in the education system?

The simple answer is: most of Vietnamese (and Chinese) adults right now born and grew up in a poor village and it's difficult to change their behaviour even after they moved.

The reason for this oppression to behave politely is due to values imposed on us by our slave society. Anyone who has read Nietzsche will know what I am referring to. As a slave, it is important to be polite so as not to be outcast by their fellow slaves

This is why only emperors or kings can be impolite yet no one accuses them of being impolite. An emperor can choose not to line up and no one accuses him of being uncivilized. He could have 10 wives and no one accuses him of being a playboy and even if they do, it is not seen as immorality but ability. 

The older generation were brought up in communist regimes which focuses on the individual resurrection of the slave class. That is why they were not taught the basic traditional slave values and behave like emperors. They are free from the usual oppression of slave values and their behavior should be admired and learned and emulated by the newer generations.",2025-04-17 17:49:11,1,GlitteringWeight8671,VietNam

I don’t have family in the US and retiring here alone just seems very daunting and lonely.  I find that most countries, except for the US, have a sense of community. 

For example, even living in a metro area, you often need a car and things are very impersonal.  In other countries, you walk out of your place and walk to get bread, meat, etc, often running into other people and start making friends rapidly….  There is a big social disconnect in the US - and I refuse to pay $9 for a beer or $5 for a coffee just to socialize….  Hence - Vietnam!  Instead of Mexico where I’m from.

* Crowded cafes and restaurants attract even more customers. An empty cafe or restaurant is generally avoided because ""the food / drink must be terrible if they have no customers"".
* Vietnamese cafes don't invest much on foods, I guess their profit mainly comes from the drinks so they don't mind people bringing food from outside, as long as they buy drinks.
* In Vietnam, there are fewer religious restrictions related to food. In Malaysia and Indonesia for example, you are generally not allowed to bring food from outside because it may contaminate the space and utensils with non-halal foods.
* Increasing revenue from take-away and delivery means business owners don't have to be so stingy with space.
* Vietnamese cafe-goers are relatively mindful of other customers. Most of them only bring foods that do not have strong smells. Thus, business owners have fewer reasons to prohibit it",2025-04-10 07:56:01,3,Capable-Package6835,VietNam

1.  There is always a delay.  Always.  Therefore plan accordingly.  If traveling for business, I would skip Vietjet altogether.  If you need to connect to take another flight somewhere else, DO NOT use Vietjet.  We mainly use Vietjet for direct flight holidays so its not usually a problem.

2.  Make sure to check your email the night before your flight.  Check your email during the day of your flight... you are likely to get a new itinerary that will have updated (delayed) flight times.

3.  Get to the airport earlier than normal as the check-in lines for Vietjet are always very long.

The next few days my dad had to go to the vinaphone office that I registered my phone number to ask them to do a check up and reactivate the simcard to prevent anyone taking over.

What you should do is go to the company provider office where you registered your phone number and request them to do a check up or investigate that ASAP.

mliknwr,1jryvod,reddit,"I'm from Finland and it's more common here and in the rest of Nordic countries than in other places in Europe. By law the parents' ""maintenance liability"" for children end when the children turn 18. But the moving out is mainly because the government provides you with assistance when you move out. On top of getting free higher education the government will also pay the students a monthly allowance and about 50% of their rent. And if you're unemployed you get other social benefits like housing benefit and unemployment benefit.  Of course if you already have a job at 18 then good for you. And then there's free universal health care on top of all that. 

So, even if you're a full time student you're not financially dependent on your parents anymore. This makes a huge difference to countries where you need a ton of money to get through the higher education. And that's why people move out very early. Personally I moved out and to another city as fast as I could get my benefits in order after the mandatory military service when I was 19, like almost all of my friends did.

However, his immediate family who moved to the states, *demanded* he pay for rent and for his international tuition as a transfer student....

In Romania, when you finish high school, you either go to work or university. Parents usually give you just enough to survive so you’re forced to “grow” without being in an existential danger.

In richer countries with more socialist safety nets, the state gives you that bare minimum, so parents are usually off the hook completely. This is probably where that statement holds some truth, since some parents might get a taste of not giving a frik about you and just ignore you if times get tough. But those parents would probably kick you out in any culture.

Some parents also downsize when kids move out, so they’ll repurpose their rooms or move into smaller houses. My parents did the opposite, so me and my sister have our own rooms in a new house we only live in for one or 2 months a year. But they like having us around.

mlioz0q,1jryvod,reddit,"German here, it's exaggerated to say Germans kick their children out with 18 but it happens quite often in low income families. As you said finishing education is a factor and in Germany you can finish your education at age 16 with a common diploma, 18 with a high school diploma, 21+ with university and anywhere in-between with an apprenticeship. 

What really happens is the moment you are done with education you have to find a job. There is no grace period for you and even if you are going to university you still need a job. And it's not a bit of work on the side, it usually is a 20h+ job.

Back in uni, out of the people who started with me 200, 10 were freeloading at home with no job. So no, you don't get kicked out but you sure as hell need to get your ass off and get a job. It's also pretty common to move out with a job or university. 

Moving out because of education is very normal too, smaller cities do not have universities, sometimes not even apprenticeship. 

One more thing is space. A lot of Germans live in apartments and not houses. There is more pressure for a young adult to leave because of space concerns too. It doesn't help that Germans generally don't like being as chummy as asians.

Besides that, I grew up with an old school mindset that you couldn't wait to turn 18, leave the house, and be free from your parents. The only exceptions  to staying  home after 18 years old were if you were in university, fell on extremely hard times, or were saving for a place of your own. Usually for a down payment for an apartment.

If you didn't meet those exceptions, you were different. People would start to ask questions, maybe think you a communist,  homosexual, loser, the next 40-year virgin, socially awkward, etc. 

Obviously, times have changed, especially economic opportunities in the American Midwest (i.e. the rustbelt).

Getting a decent/ good paying factory job at 19, married with kids at 22 really isn't a thing anymore. How apartments were seen as only for young couples just starting out in life, saving for a house;   never meet to be lived in long term with a family, and so on.

Not literally but if they want to slack around, they need to live like and act like adults. So if they are not going to college, they need to find a job and I'll charge them rent. Maybe $200 which is cheap compared to $2000 rent. 

The whole reason is to teach them responsibility. That $200 rent, I won't spend it. I'll keep it in a savings and when they are ready to buy a house, all that money is given back to them.

The problem is you let them live at home; you are ""enabling"" them. You read stories about 50 year old men living in their parent's basement because the mothers cuddle and ""enabled"" them to be lazy. So they have no motivation whatsoever. I have two neighbors -- One from a South East Asian country and another from the middle east. Both families have 30 year old boys living off their parents -- doing NOTHING. Lazy.

Now, if my kid gets accepted to a good college, I will pay and support him until he is 35. He plans to go to medical school so I will fund and finance his future. He will probably move out and I'll be paying his rent which can be $3500 a month. But if he wants to do nothing and be a dishwasher at the local diner, well, he can pay rent and act like a real adult. If he gets a  good job and say he graduates from college. He can live at home rent free while he saves up. I am OK with that too. But if all he wants to do is wake up at 11AM and play video games, he is either getting kicked out or pay rent.

mliv0sz,1jryvod,reddit,"""Kicking out their kids at 18” is only a *metaphor* to say European kids leave the household very early. Because, in Europe, we expect kids to leave and become independent as soon as possible. 
It's not like in conservative countries - like Vietnam - where kids usually stay with their parents unless there is a good reason to leave (like getting married, study/work in another city/country, etc), potentially staying home forever.

It's kinda weird in Vietnam if kids decide to go live alone without reasons. They feel guilty in doing so. It's generally frown upon. It's like abandoning the parents. If they live alone, parents also often call them back home.

Absolutely none of that would ever happen in Europe. In Europe, it is a shame to be an adult and still be living with our parents. And parents are happy kids leave so they can get their couple's life back and not worry about the kids anymore. They also treat their children like adults after that. In Vietnam, parents will always their children like clueless kids. 

That said, with the economic situation over the last decades, things are changing. Younger generations do not have the economic power to leave their parents early anymore.

mljv8m0,1jryvod,reddit,"Some of it comes from the difference between individualistic vs collectivist cultures. European countries are rooted in a philosophy of individualism where personal autonomy is more important, therefore when a person 'becomes an adult' at 18 they should prioritise their independence and autonomy by by moving out and getting their own place to live, start a career and seek to look after themselves. Other cultures which prioritise collectivism and community, like many Asian countries, prioritise the role of community and family responsibility over individual needs.

mlk5fpm,1jryvod,reddit,"Coming from a Viet who grew up in Europe, It is the same kind of stereotype as asians can't drive, and so on. But stereotypes are partially made based on some degree of truth. european upbringing places significant emphasis on individual freedom, and that comes along with independence and self-accountability. In Germany for instance, young adults are not kicked out by their parents most of the time, but it is a common practice for them to voluntarily move out, a lot of them do it even at the age of 15, when they become legally responsible for all of their actions, for German teens their 15th birthday is actually more significant than their 18th. The difference I can see between European and Asian parents is the amount and duration of their willingness to support their offspring. Asian parents are willing to work till death to support their children's financial needs, even pay for their education, support them financially, and pay their bills in the beginning of their careers, support their ventures etc. European parents do none of this, but to be fair, their society is built in a way to promote this kind of lifestyle. Most European countries have education subsidized by the state, and some even provide state subsidies for living costs and tax cuts whilst the young adult is in higher education. So most euro parents not only don't support their adult children financially, the truth is most are not even financially able to do so as unlike their Asian counterparts, they don't even save up for their children as they are not expected to do so by anyone in their society, so they spend the money on themselves and their own wellbeing. Most of my European friends started part-time jobs legally as soon as they could at the age of 15 to save up for when they leave for uni, some of them started working even before that, for instance earning money by walking their neighbour's dogs or mowing their lawns. Some european parents do require their children to pay rent and their share of bills but on the other hand, a lot of European children are paid by their parents for doing house chores, even the smallest ones like dishwashing. On the other hand, Asian kids are usually expected to help with running the family business since childhood, basically working as free labor, so it works out anyway. In fact, most of my Asian friends never had a paid part-time job like working in McDonald's and such, in my case, I was even prohibited by my parents to do a part-time job whilst in high school to 'focus on studies'. Even while at university, while most european students spend their free time working in cafes and bars to pay off their bills, asian students are still supported by their parents and usually work at jobs only if it's a degree related internship or something that would boost their cv.",2025-04-05 16:16:07,1,hvl982,VietNam

mlljelu,1jryvod,reddit,"Everything will have exceptions and varies based on family. Family culture can easily turn abusive, and there's plenty of stories of Asian parents expecting their (often female) child to bend over backwards to take care of them in retirement.

The core of this value without that kind of perversed selfish line of thinking is selflessness and self sacrifice, which goes both ways. There are Westerners marrying into the culture who happily obliged, because the sheer amount of help they received from their spouses family. It's emotional, not transactional. Parents will sacrifice a LOT to raise their kids, establishing their careers, helping with children, helping their kids build their own life, helping funding their first house, etc. Any decent kid would look to repay that sacrifice. Cultural obligations exists and is imposing, but for many it's out of appreciation and love rather than obligations.

As for what you mentioned, it's more or less stereotypes and cultural misunderstanding in my opinion. Western culture leans heavily on independence, which have different pros and cons. It promotes initiative, planning ahead, and well, capitalism. Children are raised to be self sufficient, and parents plans their own independent retirement strategies.

mm6aeli,1jug4ej,reddit,"Nah, nope. Too long, did not read: The depiction of Vietnamese soldiers and combat is horribly wrong.

>!Few details in the movie depicts the Vietnamese soldiers wrongly. For instance, there is a playboy who at every night f\*cked a woman soldier, later she got pregnant and no one knows who is the cause? This kind of scene repeated at the final 5 minutes of the movie. You know, if such irresponsibility and immorality existed among Cu Chi warfighters, they wouldn't last very long against sweeping operations of the U.S. and ARVN forces. PAVN and NLF soldiers back then were known for their vigour, resilience, endurance and toughness. It doesn't take a bookworm to learn about many love stories among them, but they picked the worst one. Goddamn, this made me speechless.!<

>!Other details to be named:!<

>!1. There is a cooking scene and these fighters chose to emerge from the underground. They do not use the specialized kitchen (I do not remember the name of the engineer who designed it), but they use a normal kitchen. If anyone knows about how American air reconnaissance worked, then congratulations, that cooking team just have their entire unit commit mass suicide.!<

>!2. At the opening scene there is a guerrilla woman dumping one of her teammates to the river. Like, really? PAVN does have a code for handling deceased soldiers. Whoever died will be properly buried, I know that many dead soldiers has not been recollected yet, but no. This is just mishandling your teammates and no real Vietnamese soldiers did that. !<

>!3. Entering and exiting the cave freely without saying a correct password. That is a kinda bold move, what if someone hostile can infiltrate the unit and leak intelligence? Watch The Pacific, there are many friendly fires for those who exit their foxholes at night to do personal hygiene, only to return and get shot dead by your teammates.!<

Irrelevant retort is just a way to soften the embarrassment. If the retort is off-the-mark but factual then just be the bigger person 
and let it go. If it is not factual then let the person know. The whole point of posting and discussing on Reddit is to share information.

Vietnamese posts on open forum such as Reddit or TikTok are not and should not be limited only to Vietnamese to comment. 
Anyone, including Chinese, is free to comment and reply.

Chinese tourists poor manner and bad behavior is fact just as Vietnamese tourists poor manner and bad behavior is fact. This has 
nothing to do with national culture but a reflection on individual’s family upbringing. Chineses complain a lot about Chinese domestic 
tourists bad mannerisms too. Both China and Vietnam governments should issue to-do and not-to-do list along with providing tourism 
visa. China and Vietnam govt should require all tour group guides to hold mandatory 1 hour briefings with their group on visiting country 
sensitivities, how to conducts and manners before boarding. Tourists are their country ambassadors to visiting country after all. China
and Vietnamese officials are aware of complaints about their citizens poor manners and bad behaviors while touring abroad but I am 
not aware of any plan to remedy this image-impacting issue from countries that value saving-face.

It is fact that China is superior to Vietnam on a wide range of metrics. 

It is fact that Vietnam owes China a lot for its direct and indirect helps to achieve liberation from French colonialism in the North and 
US colonialism in the South. Without China assistances, Vietnam would still be divided, and South Vietnam would still be a colony of 
US or a US vassal state at best.

For the ignorant, uneducated, anti-commie, Trump MAGA Vietnamese Americans - China and Vietnam are not communist countries 
so stop aping MAGA Fox (fake) news’ trashy anti-commie propaganda. Communism is not some evil concept that is being demonized
and exploited by US & the West to serve their own political & economic interests. Communism is just an ideal that can be appropriate 
for liked-minds with similar values living in small setting such as communes or villages working together toward common causes. 
Communism is impractical for town/city-size and above because people diversities grow with larger population. China and Vietnam 
govt recognized this impracticality so they changed. China and Vietnam govt political parties retain the Communist name to honor
the ideal that helped both nations win their liberations from foreign occupations. Today both China and Vietnam are single-party 
socialist republic countries and not communist countries. Economically they are capitalism. Trump MAGA and aping MAGA Vietnamese 
Americans also love to attack socialism as something bad without realizing the irony that socialism is big part of the Americans way of
life. From progressive income tax to home/car insurances, from Medicare health plan to national highways, they are all socialism at work. European Union is a socialist entity. Norway and France are big on socialism.

It is fact that Vietnam economy today is not possible without Chinese companies investing and operating in Vietnam.

It is fact that China has options but still buys a lot of Vietnamese farmers products to foster good-neighbor relations. Vietnam gains
a lot more economic values from trading with China than US because of China-VN closer purchasing power parity than US-VN 
huge purchasing power parity gap. That is, Vietnamese can buy more Chinese products and services with what they sell to China
than what they can buy from US from what they sell to US. China is very important market to VN farmers whereas US is pressuring 
VN to buy US farmers products that can potentially crush VN small family farmers just like US did to Mexico small family farmers.

It is fact that Vietnamese and Cantonese Chinese share similar physical and cultural traits due to geographical proximity just like US 
and Canada, Sweden and Norway, Malaysia and Indonesia…",2025-04-24 06:29:56,3,Informal-Sun-6579,VietNam

mny767a,1k2v3bz,reddit,"I’m moving from US to VN to be with my wife there soon. 

Odd Immigration story. I was traveling multiple flights in the U.S. to make it to Vietnam Airlines departure in San Francisco. My second trip to VN, last being a year before. 

My two U.S. domestic flights were late to San Fran, causing me to miss the 9pm VN Airlines flight. I was a bit put off, as I had to buy another ticket to VN next night 9pm. 

So I went to the U.S. airline counter to complain, ask for a credit, etc. Got a big “No”. Was told had my US flight itinerary been “linked” to my VN flight - maybe could have been compensated. 

There really is no way to link domestic US flights ti VN airlines flight, as you have to buy the tickets separate. 

I got to VN, stayed for a month. Then when leaving, VN immigration pulls me aside for “random bag check” they went thru my things, but not very carefully or tearing it all apart. I was calm and complied. 

I was with my wife. A VN woman from the airlines and asked her if I knew why I was being searched. I casually replied the truth, had no idea. VN Airlines woman said the U.S. had flagged me for a search on my return to the U.S. 

The U.S. airlines had no idea I was getting in a flight to VN, until I complained about them being late. Maybe I was flagged out of spite by the U.S. 

The bag search was simple. I had sealed packages, they just asked what they were. Upon return, the U.S. customs officer asked me how much cash I was carrying. I pulled out my wallet and said “$20 U.S., I use my debit card” and had no issue with me.

mnrk90n,1k2612l,reddit,"Alright let's get this fact straight right away so you wont ask further questions.

Yes, you are not wrong, Vietnam in the modern times has been countlessly listed as lacking freedom of religion to a good extent. As in they dont allow independant religions or worships to form, and the state constantly intervene or disrupt with followers of independant religions or independant worshippers. So Vietnam is not exactly free when it comes to freedom religion.

Now as for your other questions. Mosque as in Islam dont really exist because Muslim never really took roots in Vietnam. You can still find churches for Catholicism / Chritianity and temples for Buddhism though as those are more prevailent here since Vietnam has had quite a history with those religions.

As for the Cham well... I see that you know about Dai Viet's conquest of Champa but I think a lot dont exactly understand how much of an astrocity Dai Viet caused.

I will just say this.

You see, the Ming dynasty's consulate came to check up on the Champa empire as Champan diplomats requested the help of the Ming dynasty to intervene with the war and restore the kingdom. However, when they arrived at the kingdom to verify the diplomats' words they saw no trace of Champa culture left or any Champa people as Dai Viet has thoroughly done an ethnic cleansing of the region. So the Ming dynasty just told the Champa diplomats to give up as there isnt really anything left to restore. What's most shocking however is this cleansing all happened I kid you not in just merely 5 years. 

So yea, that's why you dont really see Champa culture nowadays and that's why it needs preservations.",2025-04-18 14:35:25,39,OrangeIllustrious499,VietNam

Probably because there are like 8 mosques in Vietnam 

There are 5,400 Churches and 20,000 Buddhist temple in Vietnam as Vietnam is a Buddhist country with some Confucius influence and Western influence from the Christian missionaries which dated back before the French colonial era

As for the Cham, they were largely ethnically cleansed centuries ago (late 15th-early 16th) when the Dai Viet finally conquered the South and destroyed the Champa empire. 

More recently, they were between a rock and hard place. During the Republic of Vietnam (and the French Occupation before it) they were not viewed kindly. Not really persecuted, but definitely had to suffer prejudice. That, the war in general, and fears of persecution under the secular communist regime caused many to flee into Cambodia. Then the Khmer Rouge started their genocide and the Cham were on their checklist. In 1979, the Khmer Rouge invaded Vietnam through areas with large Cham populations.

Some of their descendants are alive today, namely in Chau Doc, An Giang province.There's several mosques there and many people are noticably Muslim.

Islam is not prohibited outright in Vietnam, it's just really unpopular. There are mosques in Saigon, I've definitely seen one (though very small and modest, I know it's a mosque since the sign reads as such. But it's not a grand temple like in an Islamic country). But only in Saigon since it's an international melting pot of foreign cultures. Otherwise you won't find a mosque in rural areas.

mok3y0f,1k5qtp4,reddit,"From Bloomberg reporter Katharine Gemmell: 

The Southeast Asian nation’s economic awakening and fast expansion has been a boon for the likes of Pomina and state-controlled heavyweight VNSteel. But like steelmakers worldwide, they are now feeling the impact of seismic changes in global trade — and find themselves sitting on an uncomfortable fault line, caught between a global pushback against cheap steel and other exports, and punitive US tariffs that target manufacturing economies like Vietnam’s.

Vietnam’s metal industry has grown to meet the needs of a country that is rapidly building out manufacturing capacity, metro networks, highways and new airports, along with most of Southeast Asia.

But it stands out from its neighbors as the single largest importer of Chinese steel — an easy, cost-sensitive destination for producers from just over the border, as they struggle with slow growth at home and a dwindling number of available overseas markets. The imports into Vietnam hit a record last year, thanks to a particularly strong first half and Chinese supplies have risen by nearly 500% since 2020.

As more countries introduce or plan tariffs, Bloomberg Intelligence estimated earlier this month that about 50% of China’s steel exports are now exposed — a hit that could drag Chinese exports down by as much as 14% this year.

We import from China to use in the domestic market so our Steel can be exported.

Some days there is almost no garbage to be seen, most days there is some, and some days there are slicks of it hundreds of meters long and hundreds of meters wide.  

Each person’s experience with it will vary enormously depending on the specifics of the day, and what they choose to overlook.

And if you knew the amount of non-visible pollution in the water you’d reconsider swimming in the water in this part of Vietnam.

I’ve been doing biodiversity conservation work here for over a decade now, and have seen this area in all different pollution situations.

There are several factors, but in terms of pure economic growth, I can point out three points if you think of GDP as a function of capital (K) and TFP (A). Let's not discuss labor quantity now.

1. **Investment Quality (K):** One dollar invested should yield the highest possible GDP growth. The simplest measure of this is the ICOR (Incremental Capital-Output Ratio). Intuitively, the lower, the better—because achieving the same level of GDP growth would require less capital. Historically, Taiwan’s ICOR was 2.7 (1981–1990), South Korea’s was 3.2 (1981–1990), Japan’s was 3.2 (1961–1970), China’s was 4.1 (1991–2003), and Thailand’s was 4.1 (1981–1995). Vietnam’s was high at 5.92 (2010–2016) [source](https://mof.gov.vn/webcenter/portal/ttncdtbh/pages_r/l/chi-tiet-tin?dDocName=MOFUCM236509). This is clearly due to bulky and inefficient governance, lack of long-term planning (e.g., the Cat Linh–Ha Dong rail project), and widespread corruption (many have recently been exposed and tried). If Vietnam wants to sustain high growth, it must bring this number down to between 3 and 4, or even better, like Taiwan's.

2. **TFP (A):** We cannot rely on low-cost labor forever—we must raise labor productivity. A country grows much like a worker does. First, you learn to make existing things. During this phase, you're mostly copying and learning from others, so low pay is acceptable. Once you're efficient and have some capital, you can start innovating—doing R&D and creating new technology to capture more value. Vietnam’s R&D spending is currently 0.43% of GDP (2021), roughly the same as China's in 1996 (0.56%). [source](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/GB.XPD.RSDV.GD.ZS?locations=CN-VN-JP-1W-TH-US) I believe we are still in that phase, learning from technology transfers from Japanese and Korean firms. With more experience and exposure, we can begin meaningful innovation.

In 2021, China’s R&D spending reached 2.43% of GDP—almost matching the global average of 2.62%. Judging by Vietnam’s R&D ratio, we’re not ready to fully innovate yet, though we can copy and innovate in parallel. The government is trying to increase R&D spending by restructuring the budget and administration. But that alone isn’t enough. To incentivize innovation, we must improve the rule of law, patent protection, and the ability to monetize innovations. Higher education must also be reformed to allow talented people trained overseas to come back for research. These changes will disrupt the status quo and affect a lot of groups of interests—but they are necessary.

3. **Governance:** The current government seems ambitious. They aim for double-digit growth, major infrastructure projects (like high-speed rail and metro systems), and systemic restructuring. We don’t face the same barriers as other countries—no caste system like India, no political instability, no wars, and relatively few natural disasters. What we need is a responsible, corruption-free government-- from top to bottom. Petty bribes allow unqualified people into a system that needs competence. Corruption drains public funds for private gain, often laundered overseas. Hiding statistics blinds us to reality. Without addressing these issues, neither ICOR nor R&D spending will reach their potential.

Regarding new tariffs, if Vietnam can attract investment, some capital inflow from China may come our way. Even though global demand might fall due to higher prices, Vietnam can leverage its domestic market of 100 million people. As you mentioned the case of Japan, Vietnam can learn from that example. The real question is: can we use this opportunity and capital to improve investment efficiency and human capital (through education and R&D)? Or will we waste it on inefficient projects and corruption? Laos, Cambodia, and other countries are also in the game. Once the cake is gone, it may not come back.",2025-04-10 12:03:57,26,brevity142,VietNam

You're also forgeting that Vietnam is a not a free market country, but a state-dictated capitalist country. There are no private corporations in Vietnam, all that exist are state-funded and state-controlled. 

The reason is simple, Vietnamese business landscape is extremely corrupted and as soon as an individual sets up a mega business, government will jump in to either hi-jack control, or annex the business into one of their state-controlled businesses. This limits market competition, and in turn limits innovation and growth.

Like for example, my family were patrons of a local family owned restaurant(we're viet and they were also viet). We'd go in to get a meal, and they and us would share stories of what is going on with our lives. 

I kinda drifted away and eventually drifted back. They were very excited about catching up and so was I. When they closed their restaurant doors, the last few days, we came in to wish them will and that we hope the best for them, they wished us the best in life also. 

Its just what we do. At least the more outgoing folks do this more.

mlo1czu,1jrt8vu,reddit,"I don’t think he’s flirting. It’s normal for nail techs and other beauty professionals to be close to their customers. Not in a romantic way but in a “I want to develop a bond and be theee beauty technician for you” kind of way. Plus there’s a tendency to be very curious/borderline nosey with the customer. Ha. Perhaps he thought you found someone else or were going to him less bc of something you didn’t like? Idk. But the “misses you” and the FaceTime call from the coworker there- I honestly wouldn’t be worried about. It’s not misses you in the romantic sense. I get how it might feel weird considering your age. 

If he started asking you out for drinks, hangout, food, followed your social medias, actual flirting, etc… that would be a stronger indicator.

Chuyên gia bên U này cho biết là hiện đang đắp chiếu 4 chiếc, cuối năm đắp chiếu 10 chiếc nữa.

Còn chưa kể huấn luyện để dùng F-16 nữa. Không có máy bay Lead In Fighter Trainer (LIFT) cùng hệ thì biên chế làm sao được? Hay là lại mua L-39 bản cho châu Âu?

If I’ve never been to a place before and I’m not sure how I’ll feel about it, I’ll book accommodation for a shorter time like that, then decide to extend or not.To go back to your actual post OP, in my mind travelling slow for 9 days you’d be going 2 places max and are able to explore the different areas within Hà Nội- old quarter, French quarter, west lake and you can go out to the Hà Nội country side on a tour to Hoi Phu village. There are so many great cafes you easily could pick a new one every day for 9 days and not be disappointed. I personally stayed 3 nights old quarter, 5 nights in Hai Ba Trung which was definitely quieter but still a 10 minute grab ride from main area. I think overall my advice is don’t book all your accommodation in one go, leave it open. You could do day trips to Ninh Binh or Ha Long, doesn’t need to be overnight. Sa pa is six hours each way so requires at minimum an overnight stay. I didn’t like sa pa town- verrry touristy, went for trekking and loved that but only for two nights and it is so so weather dependent. Sa pa trek in rain and fog is miserable (and dangerous!)

In Sapa, just plan your trips via Google Map (every worthwhile attraction can be found). I advise against tours because they cherry pick locations when you can do them all along the way at your own time.

In Hanoi, the Old Quarter has some of the most amazing food. They set the bar really high because you can't find similar food satisfaction in other cities of Vietnam. It is not that other cities serve bad food, just Hanoi is a level on its own. Shopping is pretty limited so it is like a food tour style.

Ninh Binh is great for 1 day tour if you interested in Vietnam history. Not a particular fan of history but was intrigued by it anyway. You need a good tour guide for this.

From 18 to 27, your local phường đội, not công an, do annual round of physical checkup and score your physicality. Students usually go to school registrar office to verify their attendance for exemption from service.

Short answer, you will not get arrested. You are currently enrolled, therefore you are exempted.

However, by involving in the process of getting the new ID, you would raise a flag on yourself and give phường đội a reason to come poke at you & your family regarding the whole deal of getting your exempt paperwork done.

2. It lacks short headways and high frequency. Being a BRT system, it should have been much more preferable than metro systems due to shorter waiting times and better accessibility. This is why it failed to compete with the nearby metro line.

I'm not sure about the effectiveness of deterrence, but it feels like it's mainly to prevent yourself from having ""a headache"" over the people. You know ""out of sight, out of mind"". When the person is dead, you don't have to take care of them or think about the possibility how to rehabiltate them or whether they could commit the crime again.

Full Day tour tip to guide- $10 USD per person 
Full Day tour tip to driver- $5 USD per person (adjust this amount depending on drive time, number of stops, and how difficult picking up was)

what you gave them is fine and like others here have mentioned, a tip isn’t mandatory unless the tour company has explicitly told you “at the end of the tour you need to give the guide X amount of additional money.” or like in cruising for example, a daily tip is automatically added to the bill.

i did a $1200 9 night vietnam tour with intrepid, and on their website it explicitly says 
“ You may consider tipping your group leader or local representative for outstanding service throughout your trip. The amount is entirely a personal preference; however, as a guideline, 4-7 USD or EUR per person per day.”

You most probably count every penny, like each is a gold coin. The poor guide must have gone through torture by fire if he had to go through 2 whole days of non-stop noise and endless expectations that a bunch of you start when they get together.

mnl2urh,1k1cbeg,reddit,"Oh oh, history telling time, my favourite part-time.

First let's clear how people think of these medias. Basically it depends on the generation, young people prefer more dramas/love story, etc... but older people from the 20th century may prefer some more classical stuffs.

Now time for history learning.

So you see, under the communist party you can actually divide it into 3 periods of literature which are during-war, post-war and post-2000.

1. During war period can be splitted into North and South but I will just cover the North in this section. Many form of literatures in the North were banned, particularly the anti-war and romance genre of literatures. Because it was deemed these literatures were anti-revolutionary and impacts the greater cause of trying to reunite with the South. During this time many writers were banned from writing such as Văn Cao, Quang Dũng, Trần Dần, etc... because their works were all deemed to be anti-revolutionary and didnt serve the greater cause of war and unification.

This period gave rise to a few significant authors which Vietnamese might have heard of which are Trường Chinh, Tố Hữu and Xuân Thủy. All of their works mostly focus around making war propaganda to enlighten the image of the soldier and to serve the greater cause which is communism. Particularly Tố Hữu who was so goddamn good at making propaganda he became the head of economy management despite being an author(what could go wrong).

So most of the works during this time in the North were basically akin to war propaganda and to serve the communism cause.

2. Fast foward to 1975 after the Fall of Saigon and the end of the war.

By this period, the Party decided to loosen its grip on literature because the war was over and the cause has been achieved. 

So they decided to let all the authors they have previously banned from writing before write again and decided to take a USSR like approach when it comes to literature but even better, they decided to let people criticize the Party's actions, delve into deeper darker topics about society, the pain and aftermath of warfare and how it impacted people.

Because to the Party this was a period of rebuilding society after the war, so they thought to themselves to rebuild society properly, there must be a certain amount of criticism so the country can develope.

During this period the literature focuses mostly on the joy of reunification, dark topics about society, how people dealt with the aftermath of war. Some notable stories for these include Bảo Ninh's Sorrow of War, Nguyễn Minh Châu's The faraway boat(Chiếc Thuyền Ngoài Xa), Tô Hoài's 3 different people (3 người khác), etc...

But of course they were still aiming for socialism at the time so the thought of having western pop cultures, romance and more nudity were still largely frowned upon.

3. This is where the post 2000 era of literature comes in.

With the new group of young people willing to accept new ideas, they brought in many form of different literatures from around the world. But the 2 most influential ones are def Japanese and Chinese for obvious reasons. Now most of Vietnam's lirerature landscape looks akin to smt like Chinese and Japanese. 

However, in the wake of this post-2000 era, something from the post war period has been lost which is the delving deeper into bad aspect of society and criticism of party directly. Of course there are still people writing about these but it just doesnt garner as much attention as before or it gets censored.

So that's the history of it lol",2025-04-17 13:53:47,30,OrangeIllustrious499,VietNam

mnlbxho,1k1cbeg,reddit,"OK, first things first, Vietnamese in general don’t read a lot of books (or they don’t read books period). Vietnamese literary also suffered but of course Western literature suffered more. Years ago you wouldn’t have seen the Western classics in that picture, not because of censorship but because people simply weren’t interested in them enough for translations, and there were few with English proficiency back then. It’s only recently, with what can only be described as a massive rush for ESL education, that interest in works by Mark Twain, Dickens, Hugo, etc rose significantly. 

There is also no framework provided by Vietnamese education, school and society, that helps people think about politics theoretically and philosophically. As such, Aristotle, Nietzsche, or Arendt are not appreciated despite having no relations to the modern communism (well Arendt did, but many of her works didn’t, like Eichmann in Jerusalem). Books written by start-up founders, on the other hand, are everywhere. People read books with very practical purposes here, either for mindless entertainment or life improvement. 

Also, I don’t know about Saigon, but I assume you went to the official book street (phố sách) in Hanoi. That’s government-established, essentially only has recently-printed books, and not where the good stuffs are. Go to Đinh Lễ, that’s where the niche Hanoi intellectuals get their books, a lot of them extremely old or banned.",2025-04-17 14:39:57,6,Open-Sentence2417,VietNam

ml2wun7,1jprgko,reddit,"That’s similar to my recent trip.

We stayed 3 days in HCMC which was probably 2 days too many. Wish we’d done just 1 and spent more time out on the Mekong Delta (only had time for a day trip). Hot, humid, 8 million motorcycles - glad we saw it all, but wouldn’t go back.

Spent a couple of days in Dalaat - which was a nice way to detoxify.

Hoi An is quaint if perhaps the most overtly touristy place I visited. Interestingly more SEA tourists there than Western tourists. i’d go back - but I think I’ve probably overdosed on temples / pagodas after the last visit.

Didn’t visit DaNang, but headed to Hue for a couple of days to do the DMZ and the train journey along the coast. Wouldn’t visit again - not because it was unpleasant, but because I think we’d seen what we wanted to see.

After that Ninh Binh (actually Tam Coc) for Skull Island scenery, bike riding, dragon mountains and more bike riding. Again slightly more overtly touristy at Tam Coc, but bicycling and scenery was fine.

If you’ve missed riding the Ha Giang loop, I would definitely put 4 days aside for that (3 days / 2 nights + travel). My favourite part of my visit - amazing scenery and completely safe riding pillion with and Easy Rider.

Cat Ba was interesting - although I didn’t have the best of weather so perhaps didn’t see it in it’s best light and cut short my visit If you’re planning a cruise, make sure to book in advance to get what you want. Lan Ha Bay seemed a lot less crowded than Ha Long. Beware there’s an awful lot of construction going on in the main town - I guess it’s tourist accommodation.

Finished in Hanoi  - I enjoyed the vibe in Hanoi a lot more than HCMC, so definitely worth spending time there. Maybe it’s a little less hectic than HCMC even though it has nearly as many motorbikes. The Old Quarter is fun - but you can’t walk 5 minutes at night with being offered a massage 😉.  Ho Chi Minh’s resting place is worth visiting - but I enjoyed the vibe / atmosphere at night. If you’re planning on visiting Train Street, don’t believe the reports about it being closed - and remember there’s a north part and south part (which is a little less touristy)

ml6cakq,1jprgko,reddit,"I just left from traveling in vietnam for a month a couple weeks ago, absolutely loved the north, the countryside as well as Hanoi and Hue are absolutely stunning. 

HCMC was a bit too hectic for me but Thao Dien in HCMC is a cool trendy kind of neighborhood, with great restaurants,  bars and coffee shops.

The only museum in Hanoi I'd recommend is the Hanoi Hilton prison. But the imperial palace in Hue is a must see for me. Definitely get out in the countryside on a motorbike, those were some of my favourite days. Try to engage with the locals, they're generally incredibly friendly, I met a construction worker walking in the park in Hue and ended up having dinner at his uncles house, drinking and singing karaoke with his brother and uncle until midnight 😅

As others have said this is quite ambitious for 3 weeks, I'd cut something out but I don't know what because they're all such cool places.

As for transport, the train is more expensive, dirtier and slower than a sleeper bus. But you know exactly where and when you're arriving/departing. Busses are a gamble every time. (whether it's comfortable, wherher the driver is a maniac, whether they actually drop you where you expect them to, whether they overbook it, how often they stop for breaks etc.)

What I would recommend is going straight to Sa Pa from Ha Giang rather than going to Hanoi and back north. Interestingly your Sa Pa and final Hanoi dates overlap with mine. 🙂


Hoi An and Da Nang are close enough that you can base yourself in one or the other. I picked Hoi An.


Main differences in my itinerary vs yours is I only have two nights in Ho Chi Minh City and I arrive at bed time on day 1. Big cities just not for me. I have a bit less time in Hoi An/Da Nang area and more time in Ha Long Bay. I'm also doing Mui Ne and Da Lat. My routing is a bit all over the place as I had to slot it around a Hang En cave tour.

ml7g3uz,1jprgko,reddit,"Have you considered Quy Nhon? Lovely medium sized city, with nice stretch of beach and beautiful hilly coastal peninsula nearby. Less hectic and one of my favourite places in Vietnam. 3-4 days is enough time to chill and enjoy the beach and small city life. You can slot it before Danang-Hoi An.

Since you’ve already been to HCMC, you can take a direct domestic flight to Danang, or a sleeper train to Quy Nhon. As for Danang itself, I think 3 days is enough with a day trip to Hoi An. Unpopular opinion, I really didn’t like Hoi An. While it looks historical and “quaint” in places, it is entirely overrun with tourists and aggressive peddlers. And all the buildings are basically shops selling food or souvenirs. Bana Hills is alright if a tad overpriced amusement park.

I agree with some of the others, cut out either Ninh Binh or Halong, and pick between Phong Na and Hue. That should distill your itinerary nicely for 3 weeks. 

As for sleeper busses, it’s a hit or miss. Read reviews and know what you’re getting into, you should be fine. The bus I got to Dalat was great, from Dalat to QY, not great at all. Compare fares with train or domestic flights.

Mangoes. I kid you not, my suitcase is usually 12kg of mangoes. They don't require declaration at customs for UK either. Make sure to get the big green ones so they don't get damaged in transit. 

Instant noodles. If you love vietnamese food, go to the instant food aisle in a supermarket (AEON or the like). They will have some decent premade soups and noodle packets you can enjoy at home. I've never tried the pho ones but I know the bun rieu, mi ga, and hu tieu ones are good. 

In terms of skincare it's mostly Korean brands. Still cheaper than buying it and having it shipped to the UK but not by much. There is a Vietnamese brand called Cocoon I tried.

mkvffs0,1joujtu,reddit,"Buy cashews!! Apparently vietnam is the number one exporter of cashews and they're pretty good if you like those. Should be about 200k for 1KG (we got a good deal in BMT and paid 190K but that's like 10k difference), try to get the ones where the vendors fill the bag from the giant cashew bag though, tend to be fresher. I saw vendors in Hoi An and Hanoi easily (just any random market but not necessarily a supermarket/hypermarket). 

Also if it's allowed (or avoid pork floss ones), rice cake? type snacks from Ninh binh, they're popular in supermarkets here but some reason was really hard to find in Hanoi and only found in near Tuyet Cave but it was super delicious more so than any brand we see here. It was around 50k. 

If it suits you, gingko was selling 100% cotton (and it felt it) and my friend looked them up later and the prices were almost double in UK. It was around 600k-1million dong though per shirt/pant.

Separately, uniqlo is slightly cheaper than US (more expensive than Japan) so if you're a short person, could be worth exploring as the fit is also different. 

Haircuts and Nails are also cheaper here! (but be careful if you're in old quarter because a lot of those seem bait and switch with prices).  I got my hair cut and dyed/toned here for around 2.3 million",2025-04-01 15:49:30,3,throwawayworkplz,VietNam

mnc1625,1jzmg86,reddit,"It's not too far from what i wrote in previous post. In short term, foreign importers would terminate order or halt shipping the current batch of goods to see how things unfolds. But that few days alone could cause serious damage for manufacturers ( storage and container maintenance costs, withhold money payments).




But in long term, what FDIs see is the uncertainty of things they probably didn't take into calculations before: Vietnam could face same fate as China, target of Trade War. 





Since the reformation to open markets, Vietnam follow the same path as China: becomes a manufacturing hub for international companies. Overtime, the supply chain open up to support those companies factories ( eg: you make a fan, engine and IC may imported but the body and blade can be extruded, made in VN for cheaper price), meanwhile the government built infrastructures ( Điện, Đường, Trường, Trạm) and reduce paperwork, regulations, tax policy and subsidies ( albeit there's still many flaws). This, overall made the logistics more efficient, reduce manufacturing costs which make FDI see Vietnam even more attractive with Political stability+ cheap labor+ good infrastructure combo. Basically, a smaller version of China. 




That's being said, Vietnam still can't achieve the level of efficiency of China: smaller economy of scale, supply chain doesn't go as deep as China, infrastructure is not as good and corruption is too much( it's not like there's no corruption in China, but level of harassment of local officials to ""make money"", especially against smaller native businesses). So companies still choose China as top priority, then other SEA countries that already had a well established supply chain in place thanks to being ""factories"" of those companies for a long time( Thailand, Malaysia, Philippine, Indonesia), then Vietnam.




But as first Trump term come, foreign companies saw a wake up call: like Kissinger predicted, a rising China would cause friction between them and US, a purely economic/military friction instead of ideological like cold war. As pointed out in his book, This friction already ignited back when the common enemy between the two, USSR collapse. Under Deng, Jiang, Hu, the economic and technological baseline of China is weak, the inner political turmoils when communist blocs collapse, ""Obverse carefully, solve the problem calmly, reinforce your position, bid your time, hide your strength, never call yourself leader"" is reasonable, if not necessary for China survival. But when China technology and economy is catching up to the West, the little workers now want to build his own factory to compete with the owner, then this friction to intensify and it take one person like Trump to rip off the diplomatic pretense mask and China would strike back when they feel they have grown up enough. It's especially under Biden, an establishment candidate, represents US political elite, US want to strangle China technology by chip acts, China deemed Trump is not the ""out of the norm"", both US political spectrum is trying to take China down, the difference is only in approach and there's no reason to hold back. And of course, it's just with common sense that if you are doing business between two side, you better find an exit before catching a stray bullet, or as các cụ said ""Trâu bò đánh nhau ruồi muỗi chết"".





That's the subjective reason, the objective reason is Chinese workers wage is not cheap like 90s, 2000s anymore. China is moving away from low value jobs. Assembling mostly is for their own brands which is beating those companies hard since they do everything in-house. So international companies need to move their factories away, South east asia is a good choice as they already manufactured for the west for such a long time, ""know how things works"". And in South East Asia, Vietnam is a good choice. For one, Vietnam has a large young, hardworking workforce, with wage relatively cheap compared to other SEA. Secondly, geographic advantageous position for maritime shipping and Government support for FDI by investing in infrastructures. And lastly, but more important: the political stability. Perk of one party system is the party hold absolute power, so their geopolitical stance would not change suddenly to cause ripple effects ( like Philippine or Australia change in government candidates, cause conflict with China which resulted in economic fallout between two sides). And the geopolitical stance of VCP, the bamboo diplomacy is smart to balance both side to keep trade going.





Investment to manufacture in Vietnam is reasonable but it's not just as easy as it seems. Outside of other reasons explained above, to make manufacturing efficient, you need the supply chain in place. You sew clothes, you need an established fiber industry, an established fabric industry with weaving-dyeing-printing in place. Make plastic toy? Petrochemical, Plastic industry. Certainly, you probably can't get everything in house, for example, advanced IC, complex engine, advanced chemicals that cannot made in Vietnam then you have to import. But other more simple components, like seat or light, wheel, decals of a car should be made locally, because they're in large quantities, if you import, it would add additional cost( delivery and import taxes). 





Only if companies want to stay and invest in long term( 10 years or more), they would establish the supply chain, by either investing in subsidies factories, or profit would encourage local firms to invest to build factories to contracts them. But if Vietnam is in the Trump target, high tariffs or even regulations, ban, it would change the whole calculation. Manufacturing in Vietnam seem unattractive ( like, if Vietnam wage 10% cheaper than Thailand, logistics is 10% more efficient, but tariffs is 46% that Trump can hammer down anytime, why should i do big investment in Vietnam now? Putting too much egg in a basket is bad). They would halt investment into Vietnam, especially for factories that made stuffs for US market. The ripple effect is: workers of those factories lost jobs, contractors of those factories go out of business. Layoffs reduce consumption demand, which in turn reduces domestic investment of firms to serve domestic market, in turn more layoffs. A potential recession in the loom. That's why leadership have to go to Trump first to appease in short term then find other export markets gradually shifting away from US",2025-04-16 01:09:17,5,Oceanshan,VietNam

mk531iv,1jlo5v9,reddit,"Here is why I hate Vietjet domestic flights so much.

Vietjet’s international flights are fine, usually punctual because they can't get away with the same tricks & shiet they pull on their domestic flights.

Unfair practice by Vietjet Domestic Flights:

Don't bother selecting your preferred flight time. You’ll almost never depart at the scheduled time

99% of the time, your flight will be delayed by at least 2 hours.

99% of delays aren’t due to technical issues but rather faked flight schedules open for booking on their website and mobile app. They do this to overbook and then move passengers from overbooked and nonexistent flights to those flights with unfilled seats. You’ll get an SMS and email notification about the schedule change just 24 hours before departure—too late to cancel your flight (as per their T&Cs).

Your Options:
1. Fly with Bamboo Airways (but limited routes and flights).

2. Fly with Vietnam Airlines (VNA) (but expensive for short domestic flights).

3. Book the earliest or latest Vietjet flight to avoid delay and a lot cheaper except the departure hour is not so ideal.",2025-03-28 05:47:33,8,Temporary-Aioli5866,VietNam

molaqr5,1k5buyj,reddit,">  except for 2 things, the weird exchanged happening at elevators where people enter the already full elevator before the people inside get out, and then ofcourse the constant heat battle in Ho Chi Minh City

First issue is no better at all in Hanoi.

The second is prob worse during summer but then better during winter (but then you gotta deal with the winter pollution which is quite frankly absurd in its own way)

Also keep in mind that climate change is upending what we know as the common seasons during a year. Winter in Hanoi has gotten really weird and inconsistent and feels like it yo-yos a lot between low 10's to high 20's (Celcius) instead of just being cold for extended peroids.

Inversely... Jfc the summers have gotten brutal and will only get worse.

So it's much more a sideways move than you think and now you're giving up proper metropolis feeling for what is in many ways an oversized, overpopulated village with meme tier infrastructure.",2025-04-23 11:34:51,1,areyouhungryforapple,VietNam

mouk665,1k5buyj,reddit,"If you are an outdoorsy kind of person and like a change of seasons Hà Nội in the winter is awesome. It seems colder than it is becauae driving on a motorbike increases the wind chill factor. Its a relief from the heat for those who like the cold. Also as others have mentioned, many old houses are not insulated and you will feel it is cold. But you can get electric heaters , warm blankets, good jackets, ect, for cheap. May want some gloves for driving the motorbike on cold days. I personally didn't need them. In my opinion eating hot pot and pho in the hanoi winter especially in rainy weather sets a picturesque cozy atmosphere, and is a change of scenery from the rest of hot and humid SEA. If you want even colder you can take a trip to sapa from hanoi in the winter, where Temps get to freezing. Also highly recommended.

Reflect on the type of character that keeps telling you that it is all about the weather and southern people are more laid back and westernized (they mean easy to push around without having to do any work with language or integrating more into the culture)

mokpd0c,1k5buyj,reddit,"This subreddit is very anti-Hanoi for some reason. So let me give a counter to the arguments on here as someone who has lived in Hanoi for 8 years.

Summers here suck, yeah. But, firstly, you can much more easily escape up to the mountains than you can in the south. June and July are generally brutal with many 36 degree days, but things get significantly better by the end of August. Also, if you work as a teacher, you'll either get generous holidays over the summer so you can escape, or you can just save you holidays for then and go away.

In terms of temperature, the winters are really not as bad as people here make out. If you live in a high rise or even in a more modern building in Tay Ho, the temperature inside are completely fine. Just wear a sweater at home in Jan and Feb and you'll be fine. I personally enjoy having those cold months to cool off, and I guess you will too.  

Pollution is brutal, yes. But, get an air purifier and some decent masks for when you are on your bike or on a long walk and it is bearable. Those AQI numbers are calculated based on a 24 hour exposer, so if you do these two things, the health impact is significantly mitigated. In the last few months, the government is finally putting some plans into action for this, so it should start to come down in a few years (I hope). 

In terms of people. Yeah, northerners are much more blunt than southern. I like that. A lot of the foreigners who complain about northern have made zero effort to learn the language. If you live in Hanoi and learn the language, you will see that people's attitude changes significantly. I say this as a person who speaks the language, has a Vietnamese partners and has 100% Vietnamese colleagues. Older people here can be rough, but they have endured so much. The north experienced famines in the 40's, famines again in the 50's, was in a state of war from 45-75, communist economics induced poverty from 75-90 and then an eventual opening up to the world after that. I don't mean to say that people in other regions of the country did not suffer, they did. But the Northerns had it the worst. Throw in the more traditional culture and respect for status and age and you get some pretty sharp edged older people.   
  
Yeah, Hanoi has it's drawbacks, but it is the capital city. Name a single capital city in the world where people are not a little bit arrogant. Hanoi is a beautiful city with unique charm and 4 distinct (albeit weird) seasons. If you can handle the much higher levels of pollution than Saigon, I'd say you should try it here.",2025-04-23 08:10:39,-1,AeolusV,VietNam

It's not thực nên or chỡ nên, it's tạo nên or tạo ra

It's not không chưa, just không or chưa, or vẫn chưa

Don’t just focus on the pronunciation, focus on the rhythm I think. And if you want to truly 'feel' Vietnamese, try speaking it while having a stuffy nose.

On the topic of cultural religion:
- Most households have an altar for the local god and our ancestors, sometimes 2 separate altars. We pay respect on the 1st day and the 15th day of the lunar calendar year. 
- We also go to a Buddhist temple on Lunar new year, or visit them throughout the year to pray for health, fortune, etc. Some of the temples are for famous historical figures, too.

=> So we are not strictly Buddhists, just accept Buddhism and follow its teachings. There are also people who follow other religions as well. 

We also don't display our religion on our attire, and men pretty much wear western clothes, unless it's during festivals like Tết, or other special occasions. 

Talking about looks, most of us would be near sighted (we have Asian parents), that might be something you can add to your character.

Slanted eyes... I mean maybe? But not that slanted eyes per (racist) stereotype. I believe that, on average, our eyes are bigger than counterparts in East Asia (think Japan or Korea)

Move to Europe is also open for interpretation. Does his family come to Europe recently (Say 21st century), or did they move during Cold War? During that era, there was a considerable number of Vietnamese travel to (East) Europe, per request/order from governments to work as ""foreign workers"". Heck, in an extreme level, there are Vietnamese in former Soviet Union in \*\*\*1941\*\*\*, they fought in Battle of Moscow as member of the OMSDON division, I believe.

The connection to culture is interesting... mainly because our own culture is quite diversed and rich (i.e.: between regions) that no Vietnamese can claim that they understand everything. This YouTube video (part 1) is a reasonable primer, I would say

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEU-8AeBBbE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEU-8AeBBbE)

Also, for rock music... This is my personal bias, but can you make a reference to Sabaton? They are a good band from Sweden

>Are vietnamese people religious? What religion do most vietnamese people believe in? Any advice and help would be appreciated, I want to be respectful and connect my oc to his culture 🫶 I have no pictures/drawings of him yet, since he’s not ready.

Not that religious. Spiritual? Yes. Religious? No

I think I read somewhere, about 80% of Vietnamese people are atheist, so there would be no overt influence of religion. However, ""subvert"" influence is true. Generally speaking, Vietnamese are affected by Buddhism, mixed with Taoism and Confucius (the last is more on cultural point of view). The more ""down south"", the more Catholics you would see.

As a rule of thumb, this character would be taught to be respectful to his elders, to his community, and generally avoid confrontations. Furthermore, if situations allow, you can also put altar in his family house. The 1st and 15th day of lunar calendar (so new moon and full moon) would see some small offerings and incense on it. In special scenario, like anniversary of a deceased family member (lunar calendar, usually, but some Catholics would use the Georgian calendar), the whole family might gather for a meal together.

Other than this, there might be one common feature: your dude would be pressured (or guided, at minimum) to be excel in academics.",2025-04-12 03:40:46,2,ConstructionOwn2909,VietNam
mmogybs,1jwvzud,reddit,"As a Vietnamese, I would say. Vietnamese mostly follow folk religions (The same case as Japanese follow Shinto). Vietnamese worship many deities, spirits, and great historic figures. Some elements of other religions and ideologies were added to our belief system including but not limited to Spiritualism, Totemism, Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism. Sect of Christianity so far have not been integrated into the wider VNese belief system . IMO don't depict the guy and his family as a devout believer of any religion is a good depiction but ancestors worshiping is a must-have feature. 

Depending on where he and his family came from you can add some differences in personality. People from the north of VN are usually considered to be more strict, formal, articulate, and rigid (heavy influence by Confucianism compared to the rest of the country). People from the middle part of VN tend to be hardworking and more pragmatic than the rest of the country (this is caused by frequent hits by natural disasters every year). People from the South are considered to be more candid, easygoing, and generous.

VNese will be on the shorter side compared to the EU average height (https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/average-height-of-men). VNese follows the East Asian standard of beauty. The lack of sunlight in temperate region can make him less tan as time passes. He can become more tanned after visiting VN once in a while (Ester egg detail for the comic?)",2025-04-12 03:45:05,2,AntOriginal551,VietNam
mmpepfw,1jwvzud,reddit,"Hei, kiva tavata! 

First of all, your original character actually sounds kind of like me — what a coincidence! 😅

To answer your questions, most Vietnamese people aren't religious in the sense of strictly following a specific established religion. However, we could mostly be considered folk religious. For example, we practice ancestor worship (most families probably have an altar to pray to their ancestors on important days), and there are other small practices like that.

That said, it really depends on the individual and their family — not every family does things the same way. Beliefs can also vary a lot by region and personal experiences, so it's very context-based.

Aside from that, I think Buddhism is probably the most common religion here, but I'm not entirely sure tbh.

mmmpuof,1jwvzud,reddit,"You have to specify his personality, for example, is he conservative or progressive? What is his view over woman?

A lot of Viet men look up to virginity and woild want to marry a virgin. While many are more progressive. Many want a submissive woman and would fight and beat up their woman simply to feel like the man of the house. I only into details about the negative side bc the progressive ones are pretty much the same with the West while the negative ones are general complains about local men.

Vietnam also has an excessive drinking issue that many people beat up each other at drinking tables. Also, where does he come from?

People from Hai Phong are known to be straight foward. People from Saigon are extensive spenders, people from Thanh Hoa, Nghe An are infamously cheap. People (originally) from Hanoi are graceful and deep in etiquete. People from Hue have ear-pleasing accent (thats what they say, personally, its crap).

Vietnamese respect gratefulness (traditionally), new generations are very disturbing I stopped engaging in Vietnamese media a long time now. For example, young woman saying theyd rather cry in a car than smiling on a bicycle. Indicating their standards for men, not only they promote materialism and parasistic lifestyle, they also receive massive support from the public.

A certain famous mc says if youre poor, not giving birth is a form of kindness. And he also received lots of support. This is very disturbing as it goes against our values as a nation when HCM wrote in declaration of independence ""every person was born with the absolute right of equality, right to live, right to freedom and right to pursuit hapiness"". They deny the right of equality, as the poor has no right to reproduce. They deny the right to pursuit happiness as many claim, being parents is a form happiness. They promote discrimination and hate.

There are many other disturbing things I could go in details but I'll spare you the troubles. Depenfing on your character's personality and traits, he could be depicted in many different ways. Traditional, respectful and nice or traditional, a coward, beat up his wife and kids.

However, there's no classification for registration with ecooters/e-scooters/mono-cooters/unicycles and the like. They are classified as recreational vehicles and are unsuitable for traffic usage. Failing to comply and they can charge you with 100k-200k fine or even confiscate it.

It is correct that you need a 1968 international driving permit along with your licence to be able to drive legally in Vietnam. The fines have been dramatically increased the beginning of 2025, that is also correct, so what they tell you is not a scam. It's also not in their favour to rent you vehicles without the correct papers, because it's their vehicle and they will end up paying money too if you get caught with wrong papers.

Since 2025, the police is checking papers more actively in touristic places where foreigners rent motorbikes heavily.

 Yes this is prices in HCMC. Electricity, internet and water will run you maybe 200-300k a month (split among housemates)

Hoi An has Ancient Town and traditional villages, a must visit for anyone who comes to Vietnam, and Banh Mi Hoi An is world class (Madam Khanh is my personal recommendation), and it costs about $1 per banh mi.

I was frustrated because I had plans in Hanoi that I missed, and I’m not even sure if my travel insurance will cover the hotel since the policy started the day of the flight. To make things worse, the airline only contacted me less than two hours before departure.

When I arrived in Ho Chi Minh, immigration was a mess and the connecting flight was leaving in an hour. An airline staff member told me if I missed it, they’d “sort something out”—not very reassuring. All of this happened in less than 24 hours, and I was left speechless.

Any random can become a Real Estate 'broker' in this country and they lie, mislead and bend the truth like you would not believe.

Also, Vietnam is the only country I've ever lived in where you'll book and pay for an apartment via Agoda or AirBNB, only to receive a message a day later saying 'sorry, we already sold out!' because landlord's will often have 3 or 4 totally separate cowboy brokers listing the same thing at different prices in different places. I was once told by a broker 'I need to cancel your booking. Price listed is too cheap. Sorry sir'

And considering red books (proof of ownership) appear to be optional, or provided years and years later if at all, you could not pay me to buy an apartment in this country.

mlqdc2o,1jspkzy,reddit,"Been through this. As commentor said you can get the morphine prescribed for 10 days, but the paperwork is the pita. 

The viet really know how to make a miserable situation even worse, the care is so callous and indifferent. 

Probably spent ~80k$ in 2 years at the international boutique hospitals in order to avoid that, only to be steered in the wrong direction by a doctor who doesn't specialize in your particular area of oncology as the staff is limited. 

But you'll eventually end up at a large state hospital like cho ray anyway as that's the only place they have all the necessary treatments and medications on hand. And eventual on the 5th floor of building D to the joke they call the palliative unit, then you will experience the sheer extent of the misery of being a patent in vn.  

The most frustrating thing is the fact that these patients need sleep! But it's loud as fuck cuz your stuck in a room with 8 viet hillbillies all yelling on the phone or watching YouTube at an obnoxious volume.  5 needs in a small room, patients sleeping in the hall, there are no private rooms. Then someone will busy out some fermented  foul smelling lday old meal as the patients are nauseated from chemo. Some will even be smoking right outside the room with patients on ventilators. Doctors and nurses remind me of field medics whove seen it all and just drained of compassion. Real 3rd world shit happens here. 

Yet people in this sub talking how cheap and wonderful healthcare in vn is, they've haven't lived long enough and are too ignorant to know better. Vn isn't a place to have any serious illnesses, but 100 million people don't have a choice.

mnjjkus,1k140pa,reddit,"I’m a dog owner here and have been apart of the small foreigner dog community here for some time now.  Your worries are correct and you shouldn’t trust people here saying “it’s not bad, everyone has dogs”.  This is generally a bad place for dogs if you actually care about their quality of life.  There are no animal rights in this country and dogs are generally seen by the public and government alike as disposable accessories/second class citizens.  Dog poisonings and kidnappings are real things that happen multiple times a year, absolutely not uncommon.  I’ve heard of cases where dogs were literally snatched off of the leash during a walk.  Theres little to no green space except for select parts of the cities and many of the green spaces are littered with trash and generally not somewhere I want to let my dog explore.  You can’t let your dog off leash and generally need to be on guard when walking your dog.  People are often scared shitless of dogs and even more so if your dog is big so expect to sometimes get wild reactions.  

I say this not to fearmonger, but so you understand that these are legit risks and you do the proper research before bringing your dog here.  These are risks that CAN be mitigated and maybe even brought down to a very low risk but you need to be strategic in picking the area you live and how you go about walking your dog.  Phú Mỹ Hưng is generally great and I know many people who have happily raised their pets there for years with very little worry (though there still has been recorded dog nappings here).  Another option is living in a compound (like a gated community) in a house/villa.  This is generally the best option and gives you the most peace of mind but is going to be expensive if you’re trying to live in the city center.  Many people will tell you a lot of the high-rise serviced apartments are “pet-friendly” and i would more so say they’re generally “barely tolerating pets”.  99% of them will require you to muzzle your dog if it’s outside of your apartment and you’ll need to take the service elevator every time you take your dog for a walk.  Many of them view dogs as nuisances are rules are constantly changing as management receives complaints from residents and changes their mind on a daily basis.  Some dog breeds are banned in these buildings.  Generally a shit place to live if you want freedom with your dog.

Again, a lot of this depends on where you live.  You can find areas that are much safer and dog-friendly but you need to make sure you do proper research and scout the area yourself beforehand or else you WILL be miserable (pls trust me, I didn’t do enough research and and am now miserable with my dog).  In general I find the attitude around dogs here to be enough of a reason for me to not like having a dog here.  I prefer for my dog to have a ton of green space and for the risk of dog poisoning to be 0% rather than 0.003% or whatever it is here (pulling that out of my ass).  I’m planning to move to give my dog a better life where I can live without fear of shit like dog thieves.  That’s just me though, and I love my dog dearly — I know people here who are very happy with their dogs so it’s not impossible.  Just pls do your research beforehand.

mnjea5u,1k140pa,reddit,"Every Southeast Asian country I've lived in has been very unfriendly towards dogs. It's not that the locals hate dogs, but it's that the locals who have dogs don't treat them like family. They don't train them, don't clean up after them, don't leash them, and don't clean them. So for the locals who are tired of those dog-owners, it's hard for them to imagine what a good and responsible dog owner looks like and what their dog would be like. So rather than give you a chance, they'd rather just say 'no pets' and not take the risk of upsetting your neighbors or damaging their apartment/house. 

However, it does seem like the upcoming generation does see dogs as more than wildlife (or food) and is doing better. Let's hope it continues along that trajectory. There are condo units here in Ho Chi Minh who've learned that it's better to regulate than deny so they allow you to have pets with some caveats. But other inflexible ones like Vinhomes are just uncooperative. Despite that, many people still have pets. Overall, I've lived in East/Southeast Asia for 14 years with both cats and dogs. It's definitely harder and more stressful than living in nations that are more pet friendly but it's doable.

ml5ved5,1jpt4jf,reddit,"That is fake coffee; at best it's not kopi luwak at all, at worst it might not even be coffee (roasted soybeans or who knows what non-coffee waste). But you shouldn't be buying it in the first place.  
  
Three reasons why not to buy kopi luwak:

1. You're probably buying fake coffee that has never even seen a civet cat in its life. It's just being called kopi luwak.
2. You're probably buying bottom-of-the-barrel, shitty-ass low-quality robusta that's been attempted to inflate in value by feeding it to cats. However, it doesn't matter what the cat shits out if it's shit going in the cat anyway. You can't turn shit into a diamond, but you can ask more money for your shit.
3. It's animal abuse at an industrial scale: caged animals being force-fed ""food"" that they get no nutritional value out whatsoever, wasting away in malnutrition. The truly authentic kopi luwak would be made from the collected droppings of wild animals, and that is *wildly* expensive (pun very much intended), and you're still hard-pressed not to be swindled with something completely different.

For the record, I have tasted coffee that's been pooped out (by a civet cat? You can never really know for sure, can you?). I *know* it was pooped out, because it very much had the flavour of, uh, gastric enzymes and gut flora, to be polite.",2025-04-03 07:10:59,1,earth_north_person,VietNam

First, learn the alphabet.  
Then, the tones.
Then, basic phrases and numbers. 
Then, develop your vocabulary.  
Grammar is the easiest part imo.

1. Start with Pronunciation: Vietnamese is a tonal language, meaning the meaning of a word changes depending on the tone used. There are six tones in Vietnamese, so getting familiar with how they sound is really important.

2.Take advantages of apps and tools: apps like LanguageCrush can help you pick up words easily.

3. Learn Basic Phrases: Begin by learning simple phrases like greetings, expressions of gratitude, and common questions: xin chào, tạm biệt, chúc may mắc ...

4. Learn the Vietnamese Alphabet: The Vietnamese alphabet uses the Latin script, so if you already know English, you'll recognize many letters.",2025-04-05 02:28:59,2,MrMr0595,VietNam

mn20987,1jysjd8,reddit,"Some tips and tricks to survive SEA in general:

* NEVER take a taxi, particularly in the airport / train station / similar locations. You are going to be overcharged (if not straight-up kidnapped in some SEA countries) and you are going to be helpless unless you can speak the local languages very fluently. Book a Grab bike / car from the mobile app and pay via the app
* When you eat out, pay attention to the crowd. If you see many non-locals, you are in a tourist trap. If you see a middle-aged or older guy treating his big family, you are likely in a good spot. If all customers wear very modestly, no big family etc., you are probably in a good-value place, cheap and taste alright, but nothing to write home about.
* Unfortunately, Vietnam is not suitable for biking around cities. However, you can rent a scooter if you have a suitable license. Ask your hotel for a place to rent. This is generally not the cheapest but less hassle and definitely more secure.
* Drink mildly and avoid trouble. Remember, this is a region in which relatively few people speak English.
* Don't do anything related to ""redlight district"" (which is illegal in Vietnam btw). There are some nasty groups managing these kind of places in SEA, you obviously don't want anything to do with them.",2025-04-14 13:06:52,3,Capable-Package6835,VietNam

mlv0mfb,1jtkzoo,reddit,"Not sure how I would have felt if I were alive during the war but someone who was born way after the war ended, I'm glad we are a unified country. While I personally would have prefered a different system than team red, I certainly wouldn't want to be unified under the banner of South Vietnam whose government was too busy couping each other that they got steamrolled 1 year earlier than even the North expected. With those schmucks at the helm, we would have likely lost the country anyway when the Chinese inevitably invaded.

That being said I do feel a strong sense of repulsion when the war is portrayed as very much a simple black and white matter in Vietnam with the whole thing being overromanticised. Vietnam War (which I can't even say in Vietnamese without getting crucified) was a huge complicated clusterfuck and anyone denying it is either uninformed or dishonest.",2025-04-07 13:39:28,32,2xCommie,VietNam

I think it’s worth celebrate that the bloodshed was ended, and the supposed blood bath against South Vietnamese who worked for the Thieu regime is wildly exaggerated to say the least. You can talk about the vigilantism or imprisonment, but there was no policy, official or implied green light, to kill anyone for their service to RVN after Saigon fell.

As to the future of the country, the best case scenario had the RVN survived would be like South Korea (which I highly doubt, more likely will go similarly to Thailand and the Philippines).

But myself as a native I think it's a day of reunification no matter how much the gov tries to spin it. Even if the current gov isnt a good one and is an oppressive authoritarian type of gov, I'm at least still glad in the end we still manage to unite and not care about sticking guns to eachother constantly like north and south korea.

Anyway, returning to the question, obviously Day of Reunification is also a day that I celebrate. Boat people remember a country they lost, but it was never a valid country in the first place.

mmef8qp,1jvzpog,reddit,">planning to go for a day tour in Cambodia

Flying to Cambodia just for a single day is crazy. Including the  advised ""arrive 3-hours before departure"" at both airports it's like a 9 hour commute.

With such a short trip and large group, stick with to country. It really depends what you want to do and how you'd like to split up the trip.

HCM and surroundings could potentially fill up 3-4 days depending on what time of day you arrive on D1.

If it's afternoon, just stroll around and hit up a restaurant or two 

Day two, cultural/historical spots around the city, preferably with a hired van so you can all stay together.

Day three, a mekong delta tour which should be ok for the seniors.

Leaves you with 3 full days elsewhere, either take it easy at a resort and smaller beach town like Vung Tau, three hours from HCM.

Fly to Da Lat for a mountainous more nature type of retreat.

>In case passengers have 2 international flights (eg SYD to SGN and SGN to DEL) operated by Vietjet with 2 separate tickets and want to be through-checked to the final destination, they can purchase a ""Connecting flight service"" at ""My Booking"" on website www.vietjetair.com, or directly purchase this service at the airport by providing 2 separate tickets to the check-in staff.

I really recommend restaurant called Bep Chay Nha An - vegetarian one but very cheap and delicious. 😊

Experiences like spas, salons, beach activities, guided tours can vary but I’d say if you kept about 300,000 to 500,000 avg per day you’d be more than comfortable.

Travel 23m

So nearly 150m for three for over a month, and this should be enough.

If you for any reason change money at the airport be vigilant they will try to short you.

When you are wandering around Sai gon never accept anything offered thinking its free or cheap always get a price first.

Finally use your head, if it wouldn’t fly or make sense at home it doesn’t here.

mne377e,1k0hfyt,reddit,"1.) dont get scammed at the Airport. Tan son Nhat is a horrible horrible Airport, probably the worst one i've ever witnessed and you will be exhausted after flying in there and going out finally. DO NOT take one of the 12 Guys that will immediately approach you with taking you to the city for the best Deal. 

Go to the Grab pick up Spot. Book a Grab. Only get into the right Car with the correct license Plate. 

2.) avoid hanging out at Bui Vien walking street unless you're a 20y old Party Tourist that likes to Spend money on watered down Cocktails that cost Double the price. Its interesting to see this place though, atleast look at it, but hanging out there extensively, meh. 

3.) Go Shopping. Saigon is fantastic for local Brands and Shopping in General. 

4.) Go to little Hanoi egg Coffee near 23rd Park. They have a fantastic egg Coffee and breakfast. 

5.) visit the war Museum and Trust me on this one. I'm not into History really, but this place is the best Museum i've ever Seen. Go there. Actually read the stuff do not only look at Things. It is insanely interesting.

6.) Visit Landmark 81 at evening for an incredible View, inside and outside.
