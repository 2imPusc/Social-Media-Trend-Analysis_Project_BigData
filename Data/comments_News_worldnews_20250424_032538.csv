worldnews,1k13x5i,mnkqdhp,"[Czechia independent of Russian oil for first time in history | Kyiv Independent](https://kyivindependent.com/czechia-independent-of-russian-oil-for-first-time-in-history/)

Czechia is now completely independent of Russian oil, Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala and other officials announced on April 17, marking the first time in history no Russian pipeline oil flows to the country.

Prague is receiving no supplies through Russia's Druzhba oil pipeline for the first time in over 60 years, securing alternative supplies thanks to the expansion of the western Transalpine Pipeline (TAL), running through Italy, Austria, and Germany. The move underscores Europe's efforts to end its reliance on Russian fossil fuels in response to Moscow's all-out invasion of Ukraine. In May, the EU is expected to present a plan for a full phase-out of Russian fossil fuels by 2027.

""We completed another step toward our energy independence,"" Fiala told journalists at the central oil storage facility near Prague alongside Finance Minister Zbynek Stanjura and Jaroslav Pantucek, director of the state-run oil transit company MERO.

Officials said Czechia has not been receiving Druzhba oil for several weeks. In recent years, Russian oil covered roughly half of the country's demand.

Prague expects up to 8 million metric tons of oil from the western pipeline per year, which should be sufficient to cover its needs. While the EU banned Russian pipeline oil imports in 2022, Czechia, Slovakia, and Hungary received a waiver from the ban due to the lack of viable alternatives.

Already in November 2022, the Czech government decided to launch the TAL-PLUS project to secure an alternative oil supply. Technical work on the project began in May 2024, and the same year, Prague said it would not seek an exemption from the ban on Russian oil.

The Druzhba pipeline, running from Russia through Ukraine and Belarus to EU countries, was first launched in then-Czechoslovakia in 1962.",42,2025-04-17 12:42:53,Well-Sourced

Goldman Sachs is predicting oil pricing could fall fairly significantly if there is a global slowdown from the effects of the Trump tariffs which is likely.

$70 per barrel was the average Urals price Russia has based its entire 2025 budget on, which was already at a large deficit (and increasing) due to soaring government spending on the war. That's if you actually believe their numbers in the first place which knowing them I would not.

Their economy is still massively dependent on oil and anything below this at the $40 - $55 per barrel predicted could be a disaster for them.

It's ironic that Trump might actually hurt Russia more than they ever would have thought, purely by his incompetence on tariffs potentially causing a global recession and crashing oil prices.

Unless Trump ends the trade wars / sanctions on Russia or gets involved in some sort of conflict in Iran (spiking oil prices), Russia certainly could have some major economic issues in the near future if the war continues.",64,2025-04-08 09:29:01,TheLowBro

The translation is weird but basically I think truckers were forced to accept low prices so Russia could keep inflation down. But that can't work forever, so either the government bails them out, logistics get rationed, or prices go up.

The industry is only asking for 19 billion roubles though, which isn't a lot. Still it looks promising.

Russian troops launched assault operations on the outskirts of the city of Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast on 6 April, using infantry, quad bikes and armoured vehicles, but suffered a defeat.

Yurii Fedorenko, Commander of the 429th Achilles Separate Unmanned Aerial Systems Regiment, in a comment to Ukrainska Pravda.

Russian troops attempted to take advantage of the worsening weather conditions, expecting that the effectiveness of Ukrainian drones would be reduced in mist. In the morning, the Russian infantry tried to break through the defence forces’ positions in two areas near Kupiansk. However, the bet on rain did not work – both assaults were repelled.

worldnews,1jo2mgq,mkppj37,"A summary of the timeline as I think I understand it:

> Israel’s decision before the ceasefire collapsed to block humanitarian aid from entering the enclave, in what it described as a move to pressure Hamas into accepting new terms for an extension of the ceasefire rather than proceed with phase two of the truce.

> The attacks came less than a week after Israel renewed its assault across the strip on March 18, breaking a weeks-long ceasefire with Hamas. 

> The Israeli military told CNN earlier its forces had opened fire that day at “suspicious vehicles,” including ambulances and fire trucks, that were advancing toward troops without prior coordination, use of headlights or emergency signals.

> It said it had “eliminated” a number of Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants by firing on the vehicles and condemned what it claimed was “the repeated use of civilian infrastructure by the terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip, including the use of medical facilities and ambulances for terrorist purposes.”

> UNOCHA and aid groups accuse Israel of violating international law by blocking the flow of aid into Gaza and of using starvation as a weapon of war. The same organizations have accused Israel of restricting or creating hurdles to the entry of aid throughout the war.

> Eight of the 14 bodies recovered Sunday from the site in the southern Rafah area were identified as members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS), five as civil defense, and one as a UN agency employee, PRCS said in a statement. One PRCS medic remains missing.

> The body of a fifteenth person, a civil defense worker, was recovered last Thursday from the site, after PRCS said they were initially denied access to the area. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military.

> OCHA, the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said the bodies were recovered after a “complex, week-long rescue operation” that involved using bulldozers and heavy machinery to unearth the victims and their battered vehicles from under sand.

> Ambulances, as well as UN and civil defense vehicles, were found crushed and buried under the sand, Whittall added, accusing Israeli forces of trying to cover up the scene.",46,2025-03-31 17:01:24,AmethystOrator

Soldiers from the 14th National Guard Chervona Kalyna Brigade have performed an emergency blood transfusion for a wounded brother-in-arms who could not be evacuated due to constant Russian attacks. Reserve blood was delivered by drone.

During intense fighting with Russian forces on the Pokrovsk front, one of the Ukrainian servicemen sustained a serious injury and was rapidly losing blood. Evacuation was impossible due to heavy Russian fire.

An emergency blood transfusion was the only chance to save the soldier’s life. However, in field conditions without a surgeon, plasma or standard medical equipment, the procedure seemed almost impossible.

""A swift solution was found: reserve blood was delivered… by drone. From the rear, where a mobile medical unit was located, medics prepared a container filled with blood, secured it tightly, and sent it by drone straight to the line of fire.

The blood was successfully dropped directly into the place where the wounded soldier’s brothers-in-arms were staying. Everything that followed was teamwork and faith,"" the Chervona Kalyna Brigade reported.

Reconnaissance unit soldiers carried out the transfusion under the guidance of a surgeon via video call. The procedure was successful.

""The soldier’s condition was stabilised, and he was later evacuated to hospital. His condition is now stable. And this whole story is another reminder: in this war, victory comes not only through weapons and drones but also through resolve, ingenuity and brotherhood,"" the Brigade emphasised.",42,2025-04-10 11:30:32,Well-Sourced
worldnews,1jvp3py,mmc9vr4,"One thing that occasionally goes through my mind. When the invasion began, Russia managed to take large swaths of land in southern Ukraine rather quickly, within a month or so. Most of the vehicles and troops came from Crimea via Armyansk, and a bit via the roads at Chonhar and Henichesk.

[Aside from those three roads and chokepoints](https://deepstatemap.live/en#10/46.0303525/34.3377686), the rest of Crimea is separated from the rest of Ukraine by the [Syvash ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syvash)(Rotten Sea). If it was known that Russia would invade someday in the future (for which Ukraine has been preparing its military all the way since 2014), why didn't they also attempt to dig out a moat at Armyansk and block off the other two roads/bridges? There was merely a border crossing at Armyansk through which Russian vehicles casually crossed on Feb 24 2022 and continued inward. If there was no land connection between Ukraine and Crimea, Russia would have had a much harder time capturing Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, only being able to muster a significant force from the east, while it would take them time to build a proper bridgehead to cross from Crimea.

Has there been any analysis done on this matter?",37,2025-04-10 05:07:20,Glavurdan

In the 38 months since Russia widened its war on Ukraine, Japan has pledged around $10 billion in aid to the war-ravaged country. But this aid is strictly “nonlethal,” according to Japanese international relations expert Higashino Atsuko.

That might surprise the Ukrainian brigades riding in Japanese engineering vehicles. A Japanese-made Morooka PC-065B—a five-ton, tracked vehicle with a cargo bed and a three-ton crane—made its first appearance along the front line in Ukraine in a recent video.

Back in May 2023, the Japanese government pledged to Kyiv a batch of 101 vehicles, including Toyota trucks and some of the PC-065Bs. The vehicles began arriving in Ukraine via Poland a few weeks later.

The PC-065Bs are unarmored and unarmed, but they perform an important front-line role that puts them and their crews in harm’s way—and indirectly inflicts equal harm on Russian forces.

With their excellent mobility across mud, capacious cargo beds and cranes, the PC-065Bs can help engineers build the bunkers and other fortifications that help outnumbered Ukrainian infantry survive artillery and drone bombardment and repel powerful Russian assaults.

The PC-065Bs joined hundreds of similar logistics vehicles in Ukrainian service—some optimized for construction, others better suited for cargo-hauling missions or ambulance duty. These ex-Australian M-113AS4 Armored Logistics Vehicles, Swedish-made BV-206s and BVS-10s and ex-Norwegian NM199s share certain key characteristics.

They’re tracked and lightweight for their size, which translates into excellent drivability in the glue-like mud that dominates rural Ukraine in the spring. The same mobility is useful year-round in the swamps of southern Ukraine.

It’s not for no reason that the BVS-10s have been spotted in the ambulance role with the new 40th Coastal Defense Brigade, a Ukrainian marine corps unit that defends the right bank of the Dnipro River in southern Ukraine’s Kherson Oblast.

The downside of these vehicles’ lightness is that they’re extremely vulnerable to Russian drones, artillery—really, any kind of firepower. In three years of hard fighting, the Ukrainians have lost around 15 of their tracked support vehicles. The losses don’t yet include any of the Japanese-made PC-065Bs.",30,2025-04-10 11:46:50,Well-Sourced

The Ukrainian Navy has deployed river assault boats on the Dnipro River as a mobile air defense unit, providing an additional layer of protection against russian Shahed drones targeting the capital.

As reported by Army TV, the boats, such as the Riverine assault boat, operating near Kyiv, are equipped with Browning heavy machine guns and MK-19 grenade launchers, enabling them to engage aerial threats. The vessels feature five firing positions that can be configured with either machine guns or grenade launchers depending on mission requirements.

“The boat is fast, highly maneuverable, and can be quickly positioned for accurate targeting,” one serviceman said. He noted that while firing from a moving platform presents challenges, crews are trained to stabilize the boat to enable effective engagement. The boats are lightly armored to withstand small-arms fire up to 7.62 mm caliber. Their mobility allows them to respond rapidly to drone incursions, which have become a regular threat in the region.

The crews include both experienced military personnel and former civilian sailors who transitioned to military service. One boat commander, a former tugboat operator, joined the flotilla in 2023 after completing military training at a university.

Russian forces continue to adapt their drone tactics, changing flight paths to avoid Ukrainian defenses. “They used to fly through the Kyiv Reservoir, but changed routes after we began intercepting them,” a serviceman reported.

The crews recall participating in the response to one of the largest drone attacks over Kyiv, during which approximately 140 Shahed drones were launched. Ukraine’s river flotilla plays a key role in the country’s broader air defense strategy, using mobility and firepower to counter persistent aerial threats.",25,2025-04-10 11:20:38,Well-Sourced

> Once Russians break through the defense, Ukraine doesn’t have many forces available to push Russia back out. They simply lack the infantry. In the short term, it means incremental Russian advances. In the long term, I do not think it matters in any real way.

> Ukraine requires help in many ways, but they are on a positive trajectory. Russia is on the negative trajectory.

I expect them to inflict some heavy blows at Russia but at the same time I doubt Germany has enough Taurus missiles that they are willing to part with that it will substantially change things. Still in a war of attrition every missile counts. Germany will send Taurus before the US sends JASSM.",47,2025-04-14 02:19:32,socialistrob
worldnews,1jxz5rd,mmwqmvc,"> Russian visually-confirmed losses of BMP-1/2/3 platform IFVs since the start of their 2022 invasion of Ukraine have exceeded 4000! Here is the split by model/variant:

- BMP-1: 1056
- BMP-2: 1963
- BMP-1 or 2, unsure which: 288
- BMP-3: 705

Oryx numbers include damaged ones, so actual losses depend on repair rates and how many Oryx miss.

Russia started with about 4k iirc and removed 3.3k from visible storage.

Only BMP-3 are still produced. When BMP-1/2 are gone, they're gone.

The Ukrainian defence industry has unveiled a new drone designed to destroy Iranian-made Shahed loitering munitions, which Russia employs in its daily attacks on Ukraine.

Militarnyi reported that the interceptor drone has successfully shot down over 20 Shahed loitering munitions in the past two months.

The drone is also capable of intercepting reconnaissance drones. It boasts a maximum speed of 200 km/h and can reach altitudes of up to 5 km. Designers stress that it is the most effective interceptor drone currently in service with the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

The new drone was showcased to Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever during his recent visit to Kyiv.

Ukrainian experts emphasise that developing affordable and efficient drones provides a cost-effective alternative to relying on expensive anti-aircraft missiles for targeting aerial threats.",31,2025-04-09 11:24:28,Well-Sourced

Germany will provide Ukraine with additional military equipment to support its defense against Russian attacks, Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said in Berlin on 27 March.

The aid package reportedly includes air defense systems, drones, and radar equipment, signaling continued German support for Ukraine’s military efforts, according to Ukrinform.

“We know that real peace does not come through capitulation,” Baerbock said at a joint press conference in Berlin with his Estonian colleague Margus Tsakhkna. “Those who pressure Ukraine to surrender are not negotiating peace but paving the way for another escalation.”

This German support as others from another European countries comes amid the US President’s efforts to negotiate with Russia over the war in Ukraine. Putin reportedly agreed to a 30-day ceasefire proposal, particularly a freeze on attacks on energy infrastructure, but brutal attacks on Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure continue. Despite the ongoing negotiations in different formats, the US President Donald Trump softened stance on Russia in this process, saying that the US is considering lifting some sanctions on Russia as part of efforts to secure a ceasefire agreement in the Black Sea.

Europe has been ramping up its military support for Ukraine and maintaining a firm stance on sanctions against Russia.

Bundestag’s budget committee’s decided also to allocate an additional €3 billion in military aid to Ukraine for 2025. Baerbock highlighted that European sanctions against Russia will remain in place until peace is achieved.

Estonian Foreign Minister Tsahkna supported Germany’s stance, noting that Ukraine has been fully prepared for a ceasefire. “Ukraine has done everything and 100% agrees to a cessation of hostilities,” Tsahkna said. He stressed the importance of ensuring no negotiations occur about Ukraine without Ukraine’s participation.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also said that lifting sanctions before peace would be a significant mistake. The announcement comes as Baerbock prepares to step down from her ministerial role, with a potential future position as President of the UN General Assembly.

Baerbock welcomed the European Commission’s proposal for a European defense industry, suggesting that creating a European Defense Union is “a matter of time.” She called for reforming EU decision-making processes to enable faster and more coordinated actions.",41,2025-03-28 11:21:33,Well-Sourced

Artillery shell output at a state-of-the-art Rheinmetall factory will be almost twice initial corporate targets and, thanks to near-bottomless demand for munitions driven by the Russo-Ukraine War, production and profits for Germany’s biggest arms manufacturer will  accelerate, CEO Armin Papperger said in Thursday comments to industry media.

A brand-new Rheinmetall artillery shell production facility in the Lower-Saxony village   Unterlüß, coming on line in 2026, will be able to produce up to 350,000 155mm shells per year instead of the planned 200,000, Papperger told the major German business publication Handelsblatt in an interview.

Rheinmetall broke ground on the $341 million (€300) Unterlüß facility in February 2024.  Besides artillery ammunition – especially the war-critical 155mm howitzer shell – the factory will employ 500 workers producing 1,900 tonnes of RDX explosive and, optionally, other components for producing ammunition charges. In addition, production of rocket engines and possibly warheads could take place here, a corporate statement said.

Unterlüß will become Europe’s second-largest artillery plant after a Rheinmetall-owned factory in Spain, where 450,000 shells a year will be produced annually, Papperberger said.

After first-person-view (FPV) drones, the most effective weapon used by both sides of the Russo-Ukraine War is artillery. Thanks to on-off US arms deliveries and slow European government orders to companies like Rheinmetall, Ukraine’s army, in more than three years of conventional combat against Russia, has faced multiple crippling shell shortages, most severely in the latter half of 2022 and in the first five months of 2024.

Russian shell output is greater than Europe’s and since January 2024, Russia’s ally, North Korea, has sent Moscow an additional four million artillery shells, enabling Russian army  artillery to heavily outgun the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) throughout most of the war.

The Ukrainian military research group Defense Express on Thursday reported that Rheinmetall’s world-wide annual production capacity of 750,000 artillery shells is the single most important agency, by any state or corporation, in helping the AFU redress that Russian advantage.

A Rheinmetall production graphic published by Handelsblatt put the total number of artillery shells manufactured by the company in 2022 at 70,000 rounds, and the projected number in 2027 at 1.1 million rounds. Some military media have reported the figure might rise to 1.5-1.7 shells if in-place plans to accelerate production succeed.

The Ukrainian plant will deliver “significantly more” than the originally planned 150,000 155mm shells per year and production will start in 2026, Papperberger said.",61,2025-04-18 12:58:51,Well-Sourced

Russian attacks across Ukrainian regions killed at least 11 civilians and injured at least 119, including children, over the past day, regional authorities said on April 18.

Recent weeks saw Russia intensify its strikes against Ukraine's civilian infrastructure and residential areas as Moscow continues to reject a full ceasefire backed by Washington and Kyiv.

Moscow's forces launched an Iskander-M ballistic missile, five Iskander-K cruise missiles, and 37 attack and decoy drones against Ukraine overnight, the Air Force reported.

Ukrainian air defenses shot down 23 drones and three cruise missiles, and 10 decoy drones disappeared from radars, according to the statement.

Russia launched a missile attack against the city of Kharkiv on the morning of April 18, killing at least one person and injuring at least 87, including children, authorities said.

The attack damaged at least 20 apartment buildings, 30 houses, and an educational institution. A fire broke out on the premises of an enterprise, covering an area of 450 square meters.

Two civilians were injured in Russian attacks elsewhere in Kharkiv Oblast, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported.

In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, two people were killed and five injured during a heavy artillery strike against the city of Nikopol on April 17, Governor Serhii Lysak said.

A 20-year-old volunteer from Finland has been killed in action while fighting for Ukraine. The man reportedly lived in the Finnish city of Turku. A few months ago, he left Finland to fight as a volunteer soldier alongside Ukrainian forces against the Russians.

The newspaper states that the man was killed in the Russo-Ukrainian war.

Meanwhile, Finland’s Ministry for Foreign Affairs confirmed to the broadcaster that a Finnish citizen was either killed or went missing in eastern Ukraine on Sunday 13 April.

Jussi Tanner, Director General of the Consular Services Department, said that Finnish authorities are in contact with their Ukrainian counterparts regarding the matter.",37,2025-04-15 19:12:31,Well-Sourced

One of Russia’s most outspoken generals, sacked and detained after a withering attack on the Defense Ministry two years ago, is returning to the front, according to his lawyer.

But according to Russian state media, he’s been handed a poisoned chalice: front-line command of a notorious battalion of ex-prisoners that has suffered massive casualties in Ukraine.

Two years ago, Major General Ivan Popov was the decorated commander of the 58th Combined Arms Army in southern Ukraine, receiving plaudits for his leadership.

Then he made a mistake – sending a voice note to colleagues excoriating the leadership of the Defense Ministry, and saying he’d been fired for complaining.

“The armed forces of Ukraine could not break through our army from the front, (but) our senior commander hit us from the rear, treacherously and vilely decapitating the army at the most difficult and tense moment,” Popov said in the message, sent in July 2023.

Most of his ire was reserved for the Russian military’s chief-of-staff, Valery Gerasimov.",33,2025-04-15 14:26:38,Logical_Welder3467

Iran has completely pulled their forces out of Yemen, ending their support of the Houthis after Trump's threats to hold Iran responsible for continued Houthi attacks. Iran now sees a Houthi collapse as inevitable, as their supporting network of proxies has crumbled - without Hamas and Syria, and with Hezbollah much weaker, it's much more difficult for Iran to keep the Houthis propped up, especially with the US Navy conducting daily strikes for like a month now. And with the Houthis now exposed, the Yemeni government is taking the opportunity to open a massive ground offensive against them, with US air support.

Russian units attempted to break through the positions of the 28th Mechanized Brigade near Toretsk.

The press service of the brigade published the video of their interception and elimination.

The enemy was detected thanks to scouts who noticed the movement of enemy motorcycles on a rural road in the direction of the brigade’s positions.
After the enemy began to hide, the brigade’s drones with ammunition drop systems took over to eliminate individual Russian assault troops.    

“Under heavy fire, the Russian servicemen fled into the forest belt, where they were systematically destroyed one by one by the drone operators of the Kurt&Company unit, as well as recon platoons from the 3rd and 2nd mechanized battalions. Our comrades from the Phoenix unit and the 93rd Separate Mechanized Brigade “Kholodnyi Yar” also joined in the destruction of the enemy,” the press service of the 28th Brigade reported.

The drone operators from adjacent units were also involved in the operation, hunting both the enemy’s manpower and equipment to prevent their retreat.

Despite the Easter ceasefire proposed by Putin and supported by the Ukrainian side, the Russians did not abandon their attempts to seize the positions of the Ukrainian Defense Forces on the front line.

As a result, Ukrainian defenders on the Toretsk front were ambushed by the Russians, which caused outrage from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

“Unfortunately, our soldiers fell into a Russian ambush in the Toretsk direction. There are casualties. The Russian soldiers who carried this out will be neutralized,” he wrote on his Telegram account.

Meanwhile, after breaking out of the encirclement in Toretsk, the Defense Forces units organized a new defensive line, which is currently a priority target for the enemy.

Militarnyi previously reported that the soldiers of the 28th Mechanized Brigade together with the adjacent units of the 1004th Brigade had repelled an assault by Russian invaders who had attacked as part of an armored convoy in the Toretsk sector.",39,2025-04-21 16:30:38,Well-Sourced

Each $1 drop in the price of oil costs the Russian budget roughly 160 billion rubles ($1.9 billion) in annual lost revenue, according to investment banker Yevgeny Kogan.

A $10 drop in the price of Russian crude from $65 to $55 per barrel could reduce GDP growth by at least 0.5 percentage points and wipe out roughly 1 trillion rubles ($12.2 billion) in budget revenue, said Sofia Donets, chief economist at T-Investments.

Because oil and gas taxes are denominated in dollars, a stronger ruble reduces their value in ruble terms — adding further strain on the federal budget.

Under these conditions, the budget deficit in 2025 could exceed the Finance Ministry’s plan by 2 to 2.5 trillion rubles ($24.3 billion-$30.4 billion) due to the loss of oil and gas revenue, analysts at the think tank Tverdye Tsifry estimate.",34,2025-04-21 23:24:01,Logical_Welder3467

The strike, delivered on the night of April 5, damaged the production line, storage facilities, and administrative buildings. A nitric acid leak was also reported in the area.

While the regional governor Fedorishchev did not disclose the name of the targeted facility or the nature of the incident, details were later revealed by the Dosye_shpiona Telegram channel, known for its links to Russian intelligence services. 

Promsintez is considered one of Russia’s leading producers of industrial explosives. According to the Telegram channel, the facility was hit by 13 strike drones. As a result, critical production units sustained heavy damage — including lines for the nitration of pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), TNT, and benzene. 

According to the insiders, a TNT production line was hit. Administrative buildings, finished product storage sites, and chemical reagent tanks were among the affected targets as well. The report also mentioned secondary detonations at the site, caused by the nature of the materials produced there. 

Following the attack, Russian opposition media ASTRA reported a nitric acid leak at the plant, although local authorities have denied or concealed the incident.

Key takeaways:

* Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated on April 9 that Ukraine is interested in purchasing a large package of weapons from the United States, possibly within the framework of a future US-Ukraine mineral deal, as part of Ukrainian efforts to obtain security guarantees that would deter a future Russian invasion.
* Russia’s continued unsubstantiated accusations of Ukrainian violations of the energy strike ceasefire - despite the lack of any publicly available official ceasefire agreement – demonstrate how Russia will likely act in the event that Russia accepts the ground ceasefire to which Ukraine and the United States have already agreed
* Russia continues to use bilateral talks with the United States to delay negotiations about the war in Ukraine, suggesting that the Kremlin remains uninterested in serious peace negotiations to end the war.
* Russia is reportedly using social media and financial incentives to recruit Chinese nationals to voluntarily join the Russian military.

A record-breaking French-British air operation saw NATO fighter jets make a close approach to Crimea and the rare use of carrier-based aircraft and a U2 spy plane,  a leading Russian military information platform confirmed Tuesday.

At least thirteen military aircraft launched from bases in Britain, Romania, Italy, France and the Marine Nationale’s aircraft carrier, the Charles De Gaulle, converged in and around air space over the western Black Sea in a multinational operation flown on April 11, the widely read Dva Majora milblogger reported to more than 1.3 million subscribers.

The official Russian state news platform Pravda confirmed that report on Wednesday.

Seven NATO aircraft carried out simultaneous monitoring and surveillance of airspace and land installations between Romania and the Crimean peninsula, and another eight tactical aircraft – among them flying tankers and fighter jets – backed up the operation, the Russian platforms said.

Western sources confirmed that the major air surveillance operation, flown mostly of Service Aéronautique and Royal Air Force aircraft, remained in international airspace, and that Russian air and land forces appeared not to have interfered with it.

NATO flies daily patrols over eastern Romania and over the seas eastward, but usually with three or fewer aircraft. Approaches towards Crimea – a Ukrainian territory occupied by Russia and containing a major Russian military base and a dense air defense network – take place rarely.

Based on open-source flight tracking data, the April 11 operation was most massive air surveillance operation mounted by NATO in a single day in the Black Sea at least since Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, and probably ever, Kyiv Post review of flight tracking data found.

Per the Russian report, aircraft detected in the general area included a US Air Force U2S “Dragon Lady” high-altitude spy plane, a US Navy Poseidon P-8A maritime surveillance plane, a NATO (Luxembourg) E-3A AWACS air space monitoring plane, a French Air Force E-3F air space monitoring plane, a French Navy  Atlantic 1150 maritime surveillance plane,  and a French Navy E-2D Hawkeye air space monitoring plane.

Based on open-source flight tracking data, it was possibly the first time, ever, both an American U2 spy plane and the French aircraft carrier launched Hawkeye had entered airspace on the NATO south-east sea frontier, Kyiv Post researchers found.

However, that tracking data does not register the presence of aircraft with transponders turned off, so both aircraft might have flown missions in the area previously and not been picked up on civilian air tracking networks.

Based on open-source data, no French aircraft closed nearer than 200 kilometers (124 miles) from the western shore of the Crimean Peninsula.

According to the Russian source, the French Hawkeye, flown from the Charles De Gaulle in the Mediterranean, was escorted by a pair of Rafale fighter jets launched from the carrier, and two more Rafales based at Robinson Air Base in France.

The closest aircraft approach to Russia-claimed airspace of the day was made by three British aircraft – an RC-135 Rivet Joint surveillance plane escorted by two Typhoon fighters – all launched from the UK. The RC-135’s primary design function is to detect and fix the location of emitters, like communications nodes and air defense radars.

The Royal Air Force aircraft trio approached to within 130 kilometers (81 miles) of Crimea’s south-western Cape Fiolent before turning back. No incidents or Russian interference was reported.

On Sept. 29 2022, a Russian fighter pilot fired a missile at a British spy plane flying over international waters near Crimea. The missile missed its target. London and Moscow later said it was an accident.

The Kremlin made no direct comment on the intensified NATO air activity, but in the past has called such operations dangerous and provocative.

Dva Mayora: “Such intensity is a very alarming sign that could indicate upcoming massive attacks in the Black Sea area. So we should remain extremely vigilant.”

Western information sources generally confirmed Russian reports, but with slight differences in details. The French maritime news platform, La Marin, confirmed 13 mixed British and French aircraft had participated in an air intelligence operation over the Black Sea, including planes from the Charles De Gaulle, but did not mention US presence and stated that some Royal Air Force planes had been based in Cyprus.

The Italian military air operations tracker, Itamilradar, likewise confirmed a total 13 aircraft participating in the operation, naming some aircraft tail numbers and call signs. One flying tanker flew in from Cyprus, and one and possibly more of the French Rafale fighter planes, besides flying escort, performed air surveillance on their own, that source said.

The UK Defence Journal said: “French and British forces carried out a high-profile aerial operation over the western Black Sea this week, showcasing a coordinated display of reconnaissance and air superiority…The mission’s scale and complexity suggest a clear intent by both London and Paris to maintain pressure on Russia.”",36,2025-04-16 20:24:33,Well-Sourced

Lp(a) is a genetically inherited risk factor for heart disease that affects approximately 1.4 billion people worldwide. Unlike LDL cholesterol, which can be managed through diet and statins, there are currently no approved treatments for Lp(a).

  


The study demonstrated that lepodisiran, a small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapy, achieved significant reductions at the highest tested dose (400 mg) and also showed effectiveness at lower doses, with the 16 mg and 96 mg doses reducing Lp(a) levels by 40.8% and 75.2% respectively. After a second 400 mg dose given at the six-month mark, participants experienced an average reduction of nearly 95% over 12 months.

  


No serious adverse events were reported in the trial. The findings were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Massive crowds gathered on Saturday for demonstrations organized by Turkey’s main opposition party to protest the imprisonment of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.

“We have left worry, fear and fatigue at home. We are on the streets, we are in the squares,” said Ozgur Ozel, leader of the CHP party, at a “Freedom for Imamoglu Rally” in the Istanbul district of Maltepe.

The so called “reciprocal tariffs” are calculated based on the trade deficit and amount of total trade with each country. It’s just the amount we imported divided by the total trade divided by 2. 

“U.S. goods trade with Vietnam totaled an estimated $149.6 billion in 2024. U.S. goods exports to Vietnam in 2024 were $13.1 billion, up 32.9 percent ($3.2 billion) from 2023. U.S. goods imports from Vietnam totaled $136.6 billion in 2024, up 19.3 percent ($22.1 billion) from 2023.”

https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/southeast-asia-pacific/vietnam

136.6 / 149.6 / 2 is 45.6% which rounds up to 46%. 

Vietnamese tariffs actually average 9.6%

worldnews,1k4lcqr,moauhz7,"TEL AVIV — Israel’s far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, drew outrage Monday when he said returning Israeli hostages still held by Hamas is not the war’s “most important goal.”

Instead, with an ally like President Donald Trump in office, Israel should reconquer the Gaza Strip, expel its Palestinian residents and occupy the land, he said.

“Bringing the hostages home is important, but it’s not the most important goal,” Smotrich said Monday in an interview with a local right-wing radio station. “The alternative to surrender is seizing the territory in the Gaza Strip and destroying Hamas.”

He said “excuses” had prevented Israel from retaking Gaza in the past — including pressure from the Biden administration and a defense minister, Yoav Gallant, who wanted a hostage deal to end the war — but that they were no longer “relevant.”

The comments unleashed a storm of condemnations from Israeli politicians, including some serving in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government.

Typical rebuttal for the Trump administration whenever they get justified criticism of their failings, of which there have been many. Also, is this accusation being made against the reporter who the Trump government included in their Signal chat of their ongoing war plans in the first place?

1. Don't include people in the chat who you don't want to know about your super secret and confidential war plans as they unfold.
2. Don't use consumer grade chat apps for your super secret and confidential war plan discussions.
3. Learn from your mistakes rather than trying to dismiss criticism and covering it up and then continuing as before. 

You would think government officials at that level would know about all this, but they don't. The rot comes from the top.

Not only that, but this conversation about the exact timing and location of strikes was apparently going on before the planes were even in the air, which greatly endangered the lives of those conducting those strikes.

>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth provided the exact timings of warplane launches and when bombs would drop — before the men and women flying those attacks against Yemen’s Houthis this month on behalf of the United States were airborne.

worldnews,1k18fnw,mnk0mbc,"> The Radio Frequency Directed Energy Weapon (RFDEW) development system can detect, track and engage a range of threats across land, air and sea.  

> RFDEWs are capable of neutralising targets up to 1km away with near instant effect and at an estimated cost of 10p per shot fired, providing a cost-effective complement to traditional missile-base air defence systems.

First, the Red Cross and UN coordinated with the IDF, announcing the timing and route of their convoy. When the clearly-marked ambulances and first responders arrived at the pre-designated site with blaring lights and high-vis jackets, they were gunned down. Some of them tried to flee and, over the course of an hour, they were subsequently tracked down and murdered.

The IDF then buried all the bodies, in their uniforms, and buried their ambulance trucks, too, just to be sure, I suppose.

Naturally, the Israeli government claimed they were Hamas infiltrators in blacked out vans. As new evidence emerged contradicting their version of events, the IDF simply adjusted their claim, as needed.

""Cover up"" would be appropriate, after all... they buried the fucking ambulances. But then again, the Israeli government seems to be very comfortable lying to the world, in spite of the evidence our eyes can plainly see. Whether we believe their lies or not, they don't seem to really care.

worldnews,1jsii3e,mlmu32y,"# [Israel admits mistakes over medic killings in Gaza](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0xp969n69o)

Israel's army has admitted its soldiers made mistakes over [the killing of 15 emergency workers](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crkxm1rg6k1o) in southern Gaza on 23 March – but says some of them were linked to Hamas.

The convoy of Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) ambulances, a UN car and a fire truck from Gaza's Civil Defence came under fire near Rafah.

Israel originally claimed troops opened fire because the convoy approached ""suspiciously"" in darkness without headlights or flashing lights. Movement of the vehicles had not been previously co-ordinated or agreed with the army.

Mobile phone footage, filmed by one of the paramedics who was killed, showed the vehicles did have lights on as they answered a call to help wounded people.

The video, originally shared by the New York Times, shows the vehicles pulling up on the road when, without warning, shooting begins just before dawn.

The footage continues for more than five minutes, with the paramedic, named as Refat Radwan, heard saying his last prayers before the voices of Israeli soldiers are heard approaching the vehicles.

An Israel Defense Forces (IDF) official briefed journalists on Saturday evening, saying the soldiers had earlier fired on a car containing three Hamas members.

When the ambulances responded and approached the area, aerial surveillance monitors informed the soldiers on the ground of the convoy ""advancing suspiciously"".

When the ambulances stopped beside the Hamas car, the soldiers assumed they were under threat and opened fire, despite no evidence any of the emergency team was armed.

Israel has admitted its earlier account claiming the vehicles approached without lights was inaccurate, attributing the report to the troops involved.

The video footage shows the vehicles were clearly marked and the paramedics wore reflective hi-vis uniform.

The soldiers buried the bodies of the 15 dead workers in sand to protect them from wild animals, the official said, claiming the vehicles were moved and buried the following day to clear the road.

They were not uncovered until a week after the incident because international agencies, including the UN, could not organise safe passage to the area or locate the spot.

When an aid team found the bodies they also discovered Refat Radwan's mobile phone containing footage of the incident.

The IDF insists at least six of the medics were linked to Hamas - but has so far provided no evidence. It admits they were unarmed when the soldiers opened fire.

The military official denied any of the medics were handcuffed before they died and said they were not executed at close range, as some reports had suggested.

Earlier this week, [a surviving paramedic told the BBC the ambulances had their lights on](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckgere1y740o) and denied his colleagues were linked with any militant group.

The IDF promised a ""thorough examination"" of the incident, saying it would ""understand the sequence of events and the handling of the situation"".

1. Greedy landlords (No, posting stories of landlords being bad and charging high rents does not prove that they cause this problem).

2. Rich foreigners buying up all houses. (To the extent that this is an issue it's like 0.1% of the problem, it is a nothingburger again where you're getting angry at specific groups because anger is addictive and easier than thinking).

3. Airbnb or other services like this. This problem has been trending upwards for years and years, these services are not the issue, though again, it's a good lightning rod because, evil corporations and profts and capitalism = bad.

4. Capitalism/not enough pay etc. 


The reason we do not have enough housing, is because we do not build enough housing. The reasons for that are numerous, the biggest being NIMBYism. We have vast numbers of people who view their homes and the price of said homes as their investment, so price needs to be going up at all times, this is at odds with increasing the supply of housing because it discourages increasing the supply, or building any housing that does not increase the value of the surrounding housing near it. Regulations and other issues also obviously play into it, as well as price of labour and raw materials. The governments of the developed World need to step in in a big way to stimulate and encourage the construction of housing before it fucking destroys us, but because everyone is obsessed with being mad at specific groups (populist BS) they don't get what they want. Also, governments just keep on trying to soothe people with stuff like providing funds for people to get on the property ladder the first time, thus stimulating demand, there is *plenty* of fucking demand, that's the fucking problem.",0,2025-04-06 13:14:37,BruyceWane

worldnews,1jqpllv,ml8oaua,"Excerpt:

""The world is fast approaching temperature levels where insurers will no longer be able to offer cover for many climate risks, said Günther Thallinger, on the board of Allianz SE, one of the world’s biggest insurance companies. He said that without insurance, which is already being pulled in some places, many other financial services become unviable, from mortgages to investments.

Global carbon emissions are still rising and current policies will result in a rise in global temperature between 2.2C and 3.4C above pre-industrial levels. The damage at 3C will be so great that governments will be unable to provide financial bailouts and it will be impossible to adapt to many climate impacts, said Thallinger, who is also the chair of the German company’s investment board and was previously CEO of Allianz Investment Management.

...Thallinger said it was a systemic risk “threatening the very foundation of the financial sector”, because a lack of insurance means other financial services become unavailable: “This is a climate-induced credit crunch.”

“This applies not only to housing, but to infrastructure, transportation, agriculture, and industry,” he said. “The economic value of entire regions – coastal, arid, wildfire-prone – will begin to vanish from financial ledgers. Markets will reprice, rapidly and brutally. This is what a climate-driven market failure looks like.”",45,2025-04-03 18:10:38,RunAmbitious2593

I really can't fathom why, as an ante, candidates shouldn't have to have at least a top secret security clearance prior running to be an MP, and all MPs should be required to maintain a top secret security clearance as a condition of their role.

Here are the clearance levels:

**Site Access**: This is a lower-level clearance, allowing access to certain government facilities and information.

**Personnel Security Screening (PSC**): This is a screening done by Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC) and is required for jobs within Federal Government Departments/Agencies and some Private companies.

**Reliability Status**: This is a lower-level security screening required for individuals who need access to protected or controlled information, assets, or work environments.

**Secret:** This level allows access to confidential information that could cause significant harm if compromised.

**Top Secret**: This is a higher-level clearance, allowing access to highly sensitive information that could cause grave harm to national security if disclosed.

**Enhanced Top Secret**: This is the highest level of security clearance, requiring a more rigorous assessment than Top Secret.

It wouldn’t play out that way in the slightest.

The US has backed away from any type of “nation-building”.  If the US attacked, it would primarily be from the air and cyber—boots on ground wouldn’t be a thing (at least boots on ground in the traditional sense).

The entire purpose of the attack would be to take out key military targets and then let the regime deal with the rubble.  

Something to think about here—Iran has been on the verge of a civil uprising for years now.  What type of kinetic push would be required to start that?  Again, boots on ground not necessarily needed.

Edit to add here:  re: underground facilities.

Just because they are underground doesn’t mean they can’t be rendered ineffective.  Underground facilities require workers to be…well…underground.  Collapsing tunnels or making the conditions inside incompatible with human life is a thing.  Sure, equipment would still be there—but doesn’t mean you can’t make it impossible to actually use.  You don’t have to worry about enriched uranium if people can’t get it out, or people can’t get in.",6,2025-04-01 10:46:25,CapitalJeep1

For anyone wondering, no, this was not a deep sea submarine like Oceangate, this is a common sort of tourist attraction in many places. They look like [this](https://www.submarinesafaris.com/about-us/our-submarines/) usually. I've seen similar in Tenerife, Mexico, Mallorca and Phuket

The company operating this tour was Sindbad Submarines. [This is their website](https://www.sindbadsubmarines.com/). Their specs are a max dive depths of 25 meters. These boats usually operate very close to the shore and near ports. They have a 44 passenger capacity and have two pilots. It advertises an airconditioned day tour of coral reefs near the harbour (which is where it sank) with hotel pickup, guided tour, etc.

These are *usually* pretty safe. I've been on one in Gran Canaria, and there was a extensive emergency presentation, oxygen masks and even a patrol boat nearby. Would I go to one in Egypt? Probably not. But this company also had good reviews and from what I can tell also had oxygen masks and emergency evacuaton plans, as well as both a boat and a floating platform in the vicinity of the sub, so I wouldn't point fingers at poor quality/improper training just yet.",553,2025-03-27 11:16:38,QuarterTarget

worldnews,1jril9c,mli4odw,">**Economy Minister Lukas Savickas insists that it is the European Union, not individual countries, that should negotiate with the United States on the tariffs imposed by Donald Trump.**

>“It is very important to maintain solidarity between the different EU member states, to negotiate as one significant, truly economically powerful economic bloc. This is basically what is being done,” he told LRT RADIO on Friday.

>He said that the EU must send a clear signal that it is ready to reach an agreement, to negotiate with the US in the search for a trade balance.

>“I am certainly hearing through both formal and informal channels that the EU commissioners responsible are ready to negotiate. We have to hope that the best case scenario will still happen, but we are also preparing for the other scenario, we are assessing the situation and what is needed to help our companies adapt to the changing situation,” said Savickas.

>According to the minister, the European Commission intends to respond “proportionately” to the US decisions, but keeps stressing that it would be better to reach an agreement and find a compromise without introducing mutual trade barriers.

>US President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that he will impose a 20% duty on imports from the European Union. He did not specify which specific goods would be subject to which specific duties.

>The Lithuanian Ministry of Economy and Innovation forecasts that such an aggressive trade policy would depress Lithuania’s GDP growth by 0.65% points over 3–4 years.

>Lithuania’s direct exports to the US account for about 6.8% of total exports of goods of Lithuanian origin and totalled 1.6 billion euros last year.

>On Thursday, the Ministry of Economy and Innovation presented the first €20 million plan of measures to help businesses potentially affected by tariffs, aimed at mitigating the impact of the trade war launched by the US, and to help diversify markets.

>The Bank of Lithuania had earlier announced that a possible trade war between the US and the EU would reduce Lithuania’s economic growth by 0.33-1.3 points over four years.",7,2025-04-05 06:31:54,BubsyFanboy

worldnews,1joaroe,mkqbd6c,"Heads down, they charge through the knee-high grass reaching speeds of up to 120kph, a hard-wired legacy from the days when Asiatic cheetahs were the top predators on these central Asian grasslands.

A relic from the last ice age, the saiga once rubbed shoulders with the mammoth and woolly rhinoceros. It is incredibly tough, able to survive the worst extremes the steppe can muster. In winter, when temperatures plummet to -45°C, it grows a thick shaggy coat, while its bulbous nose warms the cold air it breathes. In summer, when the mercury can hit 45°C, its nose helps to filter dust, as well as cooling the blood.

Following decades of conservation work, this strange-looking antelope, which wouldn’t be out of place on the set of Star Wars, is back, with more than 2.8 million individuals now roaming the landscape. But 20 years ago, the picture was quite different.

Kazakhstan  is the ninth-largest country in the world and a territory of the former Soviet Union. When communism collapsed in the 1990s, so did the country’s agrarian economy, with a mass exodus of people from the countryside to the cities. Farms were abandoned, livestock disappeared and the state-sponsored harvesting of saiga for meat also came to an end. 

The steppe became lawless, with the saiga at the mercy of poachers who slaughtered the males in huge numbers, their horns much prized for use in traditional medicine in China. This also broke the natural equilibrium, leaving females outnumbering males by as much as 10:1.

Hunting was banned in 1999, but despite the ban being heavily enforced, the population dropped to fewer than 50,000 by 2005. This was the year the Altyn Dala (Golden Steppe) Conservation Initiative was founded, a partnership between the Kazakhstan government, the Association for the Conservation of Biodiversity of Kazakhstan (ACBK), and international groups such as Fauna & Flora, the RSPB and Frankfurt Zoological Society.",25,2025-03-31 18:49:08,hion_8978

This to me reads more like they are considering how they can make the mandate more beneficial to UK manufacturing. I.E., could look at being more beneficial to other companies that are NOT Tesla.

worldnews,1jiurpm,mjjrbkb,">**The Defence Ministry has proposed that Lithuanian citizens who also hold Russian, Belarusian or Chinese passports be barred from enrolling in the country’s main officer school, the General Jonas Žemaitis Military Academy of Lithuania.** 

>The proposal is outlined in a draft government resolution submitted by the Defence Ministry for approval.

>The ministry told BNS that the proposed legislative amendment would also require cadets to report any foreign citizenship they hold.

>“If it is found that a cadet holds the citizenship of a country listed as hostile – Russia, Belarus, or China – they will be dismissed or expelled from the Lithuanian Military Academy,” the ministry said in its response.

>This means the individual will be unable to complete their studies and become a Lithuanian military officer.

>The ministry also noted that if a cadet is dismissed, they will not be required to repay their tuition fees, but if they are expelled, they will.

>In cases where a cadet enrols in the academy and their citizenship later becomes part of the list of hostile countries, the cadet will automatically be dismissed.

>“Otherwise, if a cadet held the citizenship of a hostile state before enrolling in the academy, \[...\] and concealed this fact, they will be expelled and required to pay,” the ministry said.

>According to the draft resolution, these changes aim to prevent military service members with citizenships of hostile countries from becoming targets of intelligence and security services from hostile countries, as well as to limit the risk of recruitment or other forms of hostile intelligence activity.

>In January 2024, the government approved a list of countries that military personnel and officials are banned from travelling to for national security reasons. The list includes three countries: Belarus, China, and Russia.

>The Defence Ministry has previously proposed that Lithuanian citizens who hold these countries’ passports not be admitted to the Lithuanian Riflemen’s Union.",2,2025-03-24 21:21:03,BubsyFanboy

worldnews,1jyzsuz,mn2ba07,"PESHAWAR, Pakistan — On Jan. 9, 2018, an M4A1 carbine rifle left the Colt’s Manufacturing plant in Connecticut, bound for Afghanistan. Last month, it was recovered in the aftermath of a deadly train hijacking by militants in Pakistan.

The banged-up rifle, bearing serial number W1004340 and stamped with the Colt logo, was among billions of dollars’ worth of U.S. military equipment provided to Afghan forces, much of which was abandoned after the withdrawal of American troops in 2021.

Many of the weapons wound up across the border in Pakistan, at arms bazaars and in the hands of insurgents, illustrating how the consequences of America’s failed war continue to reverberate years after the fall of Kabul to the Taliban.
