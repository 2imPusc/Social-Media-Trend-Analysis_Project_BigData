1jr7zgf,reddit,i went on a solo trip thinking i’d “find myself” or whatever… but instead i got drunk w a 73yo italian grandma & ended up in a village wedding??,"okay sooo this was not in the plan at all.

i booked a solo trip to italy cause i thought i needed one of those life changing moments ppl always talk about. packed my little backpack, journal, headphones with a sad girl playlist. i was READY to heal.

first day i was in naples and met this older lady (she was literally wearing a leopard dress and heels at 10am, queen energy). we started talking cause i helped her carry something, and somehow she invited me to her village outside the city for “real food and better wine”.

long story short: i said yes, she takes me on this sketchy but cute train, i meet her WHOLE family, everyone is yelling (but like the loving kind), i drink way too much homemade wine, and 6 hours later i’m dancing barefoot at a wedding for a couple i’ve never met in my life.

everyone was hugging me and calling me “bella ragazza” and i cried a lil cause it just felt so warm and… real. not like the curated tiktok travel stuff, just like life happening.

anyway. didn’t find myself but def found out that italian grandmas party harder than me lol. 10/10 would do again.",2025-04-04 09:42:31,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,52530,1744,,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jr7zgf/i_went_on_a_solo_trip_thinking_id_find_myself_or/,FoxyEnchantingSimp
1jrf8zn,reddit,First and Maybe Last Visit to India?,"I’ve only visited 18 countries and even though the historical buildings, architecture, and cuisine were incredible, I have little desire to return to India. 

As a fairly tall Black American male I stood out among everyone. I was grabbed often, all by men, stared at for an ungodly length of time, and just generally felt overwhelmed and uncomfortable there. The staring is next level. It’s not a glance. It’s a purposeful observation that continues indefinitely. At one point a man was looking at me from a few feet away. I moved to block his view then he moved to get closer to me to continue the gawking. 

The poverty is disturbing and the absurd amount of garbage is nightmare fuel for environmentalists. Locals don’t seem to care much about the cleanliness in the urban areas. Watched several people willingly throw trash into the street from apartments and train cars. Why do they do this?

On the other hand, the Taj Mahal is incredible. Easily the most fascinating part of our trip. We’ve been to 6 new world wonders, 7 if we include the Pyramids of Giza, and the TM is in my top 2 with Petra being the best. 

Walking through the gate and seeing the mausoleum in the background bathing in the morning light was like stepping into a fairy tale land. We loved it so much, we returned for a second day. There are rooftop bars and restaurants too with incredible views and inexpensive food and booze. 

My suggestion visiting India would be to ensure everything is private. Transportation, guides, etc. The logistics can be a pain so the peace of mind of having everything taken care of for you is worth the cost imo.

1k1etvf,reddit,"Tokyo under cherry blossoms, Mar/Apr 2025","This was my first time visiting Tokyo, Japan, and a long time dream destination. I was lucky my visit coincided with the cherry blossom season! I did not plan the visit around it; I just so happened to notice quite a few flights flying through Tokyo on my way back from the Philippines that I decided to do a layover for … 2 weeks! It was when I reviewed my trip itinerary early this year that I learned cherry blossoms in Tokyo would start blooming the week I arrived!

Though there are many recommended places to view cherry blossoms (one of which was Ueno Park), I find those places to be easily overwhelmed with crowds and become less enjoyable. I found cherry blossoms to be ubiquitous in the city. You could easily find a small park, a shrine, a temple, a museum, a gallery, or a hidden street with lots of cherry blossoms and no crowds, and have the view all to yourself without interruption.

The only downside to this visit was that half of the time it rained pretty hard! Yet, even with the rain, the cherry blossoms still looked beautiful and gave a nice touch of colour to the greyness, and the city itself looked different, in a good way, under the rain.

Despite its geographic and population size, I do find Tokyo overall to be quiet. Indeed, places like Shibuya, Shinjuku, Harajuku, Ginza, Akihabara, and Asakusa can be (very) loud, but I found when you turn a corner to a residential area or empty street, it becomes quiet as if you were far away from all the action. As well, the city is clean. I only saw littering at tourist spots, but it was very minimal. Even the garbage trucks I saw were quite pristine and odorless!

Its renowned public transportation system lived up to its reputation. It was easy to get around the city with the subway and trains, though I got lost multiple times in stations like Shibuya, Ueno, and Tokyo. I also found Tokyo to be a walkable city, with a lot of sidewalks for pedestrians and minimal traffic. Maybe this is a result of a public transportation system where people don’t rely on cars (and hence less noise pollution)? Speaking of cars, people are very safe and good drivers.

Like many people on here have mentioned, I highly recommend Tokyo! I’m already planning to visit again in a few years, as well as other cities. I can go on about other things, but I’d love to hear other people’s travel experience, stories, and recommendations in Tokyo!",2025-04-17 14:56:13,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,5190,96,,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k1etvf,shense

1jrepvf,reddit,"My trip to Antarctica: icebergs, penguins, sleeping on the ice etc.","Hi everyone, I want to share with you a few pictures and feelings from my journey to Antarctica last autumn. 

Icebergs, penguins, orcas, seals, landings, sleeping on the snow of the 7th continent – the trip had it all. I decided that if any of my travels is worth sharing, this is the one.

It’s my first ever post on Reddit so please let me know if I messed up somehow so I could do better next time.

##Setting Sail from Ushuaia

On Nov 24th I boarded the World Explorer in Ushuaia with 160 fellow travelers for a 10-day Antarctic expedition with Quark Expeditions. $10 000 didn’t get me a private cabin, so I shared a room with Akira-san from Japan. We were perfect roommates: he spent his time at the bar while I rested in the cabin, and our shower schedules never overlapped. An introvert’s dream.

The passengers and crew came from all over: Canada, Australia, Europe, my new buddies from the US, and beyond. It was fascinating to connect with people from so many different backgrounds, accents, and stories. 10 days on a ship with no internet really boost communication skills. 

Safety was a priority, starting with a mandatory drill. The ship had a small shop selling warm clothing for those who forgot essentials, a lecture hall, and a restaurant. One of the top decks featured an enclosed observation deck where we could watch the scenery with a drink in hand, or step outside for an unobstructed view. That’s also where we gathered for a toast at the end of the journey. 

Beyond the enclosed lounge, the open decks at the bow and stern offered incredible views. The bow was off-limits at high speeds, but the stern remained accessible. The real adventure, though, began in the mudroom, where we suited up in waterproof boots and life jackets before boarding Zodiacs – sturdy rubber boats that carried us ashore or on exploration rides.

##Crossing the Drake & a bit on Icebergs

To reach Antarctica from South America, we had to cross the Drake Passage, one of the roughest seas on Earth. Winds can exceed 100 km/h (62 mph), and waves sometimes reach 15 meters (50 ft) high. Between the 17th and 19th centuries, around 800 ships sank there. But we were in luck and the crossing went smoothly both on the way there and back.

As we neared Antarctica, icebergs appeared. In November summer began in Antarctica, and with temperatures around 0C the ice was melting. If an iceberg is white, it means it’s relatively young. If it’s blue, that means the ice has been compacted over thousands of years, and now filters out certain wavelengths of light. About 80–90% of an iceberg is underwater, and because seawater is warmer than air, the submerged part melts faster, sometimes causing icebergs to flip over. 

I witnessed as one began to overturn and split apart – an incredible moment. It was so grand, but also fast and fleeting that I chose to save it in my memory instead of my phone.

##Zodiac boat cruises

Every day, we made explorations cruises on the Zodiacs. Dressed in full waterproof gear (jacket, pants, boots, gloves) we boarded in groups. At first, people wobbled nervously as they stepped in, but after a few trips, everyone got the hang of it.

Some days, the boats drifted slowly among the ice, other times, flew fast across open water. We always found something interesting. One of the highlights was a floating whaling factory that shipwrecked nearly 100 years ago. We also scooped ice chunks from the sea a couple times. One particularly nice piece ended up in the ship’s bar for cocktails.

##Weddell Seals

Besides icebergs, what did we see while cruising? Seals! Mostly Weddell seals, which only live in Antarctica. They can hold their breath for an hour while hunting krill, fish, and octopuses. I had assumed all seals ate penguins, but turns out, not all of them do.

After their deep dives, they lounge on the ice all day, behaving like oversized cats. Nothing threatens them on land as the polar bears only live in the Arctic.

Underwater they make bizarre, otherworldly sounds, like a techno party in full swing. If you’re curious, search for “Weddell seal vocalizations” on YouTube. It’s wild.

One day, we came across a juvenile elephant seal – a big brown blob with a large snout. I wanted to attach a photo, but Reddit’s limits had other plans. Still, quite the sight. 

##Landings & Penguin Colonies

Not every Zodiac trip was just a cruise, half the time, we landed on islands or the Antarctic continent itself. Before letting us disembark, the expedition team scouted the area for interesting sights like glaciers, penguins, or sleeping seals, then checked for dangerous crevasses in the ice. Once they flagged a safe path, we were good to go.

Penguins were everywhere. To prevent the spread of avian flu, we sanitized our boots before and after every landing and stayed at least 5 meters away from them. We also avoided crouching, so any potential contaminants wouldn’t transfer on jackets. Penguins, in turn, were completely unfazed by humans. They waddled right up to the boats or dove alongside them. Since the signing of the Antarctic Treaty 65 years ago, no one has hunted them.

We also visited an Argentine emergency shelter, stocked with food and a radio for stranded expeditions. It’s also Argentina’s way of staking a territorial claim in case the Antarctic Treaty is ever dissolved. Passed by several research stations, including the Primavera base, which studies rare mosses and lichens growing in an area where the permafrost has retreated. Couldn’t visit without permission though.

##More about penguins

At the start of the trip, our expedition leader joked that we’d soon be rolling our eyes, saying, “Ugh, more penguins.” He wasn’t wrong.

We mostly saw two species:
- Gentoo penguins with red beaks. Their population is growing, possibly because they feed their chicks for a couple of extra weeks. 
- Chinstrap penguins, named for the black stripe on their chins. 
Also spotted a few Adelie penguins, but they mainly live farther south.

What came as a surprise to me is penguin colonies stink. You can smell them from hundreds of meters away. My parka still carried the scent when I got back home, despite my last penguin encounter being four days earlier. These stinkies have interesting cooling strategies: since they don’t sweat, they either take a swim, gape their beaks open, or lift their flippers to expose thinner-feathered skin.

At this time of year (early December), penguins were nesting. They build their nests out of stones, leading to constant rock theft between neighbors. They also had to deal with skuas – birds pretend to rest in the colony, then suddenly snatch an egg. The penguins respond by screaming, stretching their necks, and snapping their beaks until the intruder leaves. 

In Gentoo and Adelie families males and females take turns incubating eggs, swapping shifts every few days. A true team effort! They don’t rest the eggs on their feathers but on a special patch of bare skin to keep them warm. 

##Sleeping on the Ice

One landing was unique: 30 of us spent the night sleeping on the ice. The ship dropped us off on a shore with no penguins and sailed away. We stomped out sleeping spots, laid down mats and sleeping bags, and settled in. I took a few Lego figurines with me for fun photos and as a souvenir to bring back.

Slept for maybe two hours. First, because how do you sleep in Antarctica? Second, because it was the beginning of the polar day – so no real night for me. Third, it started snowing, and became increasing harder to breath in the sleeping bag while also not getting covered in snow.

I woke up first and got to watch a seal swim nearby. Some of my neighbors, however, were rudely awakened by mating skuas right next to them. Yes, there’s video. No, I’m not posting it.

##Orcas and a Humpback

We encountered orcas twice. These apex predators eat anything that swims: seals, whales, even great whites in warmer waters. Scientists might eventually classify them as multiple distinct species, since some specialize in hunting penguins, others seals, others whales etc.

I also caught a glimpse of a humpback whale. Fun fact: each humpback has a unique pattern on the underside of its tail, like a fingerprint. I submitted my photo to the HappyWhale database and now I can track if anyone else spots “my” whale in the future.

##Final takeaway

I can talk endlessly about all of this, but really the trip was beyond words. Antarctica is stunning and surreal. If you ever get the chance to visit – go for it. 

Happy to share more details and answer questions if you have any.

1jypx1g,reddit,Passport was taken away when coming home from international flight?,"Is this something you’ve ever heard of? Came home from Mexico to New Jersey today and when I finally reached the end of the security line, they took me into secondary screening.

I was convinced I’d be stuck at the airport for at least another hour; but after about 10 minutes they told me my passport was reported stolen or missing… Now I’ve obviously never done that myself, and I explained that to which they believed. However, they told me they had to keep it to discard of it, and I’d simply have to get a new passport. 

Having travelled all day, I didn’t bother arguing or inquiring any further outside of surface level questions on the matter since I was tired. They let me exit without my passport and I was told I’d need to get a new one. Last time I needed a new passport I was a minor, so I did not think much of it. But now I’m seeing how expensive they can be and am calling bs as I still had multiple years left before expiration.

Because of some factor outside of my control, I have to now shelve over money for a new passport? It doesn’t help that I am leaving the country again in July. Does anyone have any advice or tips on how I should proceed? Thanks in advance!

1jxc65n,reddit,Some of my favourite images from Bhutan,"We just got back from Bhutan yesterday. We left from Paro airport ( currently the only international airport) 

11 night is total were spent across the following areas. 

Thimphu to Punakha to Phobjikha valley to Paro.

The whole experience was a great mixture of culture, relaxation and nature with lots of hikes. Both of us are not into hiking back home, so we both went hiking every weekend for 3 months before our trip. Definitely a must as some of these walks are above 3000m and we could the difference. 

All the people were lovely warm and trustworthy. They always asked if this was our first time and how we heard about Bhutan. It was a fair question, as most of the people at work had heard of it but didn't know where it was. 

They also said to spread the word. So here I am HIGHLY RECOMMEND GOING TO BHUTAN. 

It's expensive but it's one of those bucket list places that should be ticked off if you can afford it. 

The only thing I would change if we went again would be the timing. There were quiet a few forrest fires around due to it being so dry. This made visibility limiting at times. You can probably see it in the photos.  A better time to go would be in August or September I think.

1k2ud56,reddit,I keep getting stopped at the US border and I just found it’s because of multiple “no shows”?,"I had just flown back to my hometown in Canada to visit after living in Europe for half a year. There was a good priced flight with a layover in Washington DC, which I didn’t think was gonna be a big deal. Luckily I had chosen the flight with a layover of 3 hours because I would’ve missed my connecting flight if I had chosen the 1h30m one. I flew Paris to Washington and final destination being Toronto. When I got off in Washington, I realized I had to go through US customs to get to my connecting flight gate.

It was 8PM, not many people there and of course I get stopped. They put my passport in a locked security case and sent me to a room for questioning. No one was else was in the room but me so I sat there waiting while the worker looked through my file for a good 5-10 minutes and eventually started questioning my whole life story. “Where are you from? Where do you live now? What do you do for work? Explain your job to me.” Then the questions started getting more intense. “Where are your clients? How do you get your clients? Can you show me examples of your work?” He wanted me to show him my portfolio as I worked in the creative industry, and explain each project. I was thinking to myself that this was insane, he asked for my portfolio? Are these questions normal? 

Eventually I got sent to another officer for them to look through my entire suitcase and backpack while being asked my life story again. Same questions while i’m being questioned about the contents of my baggage.

I had gone through this once before 9 years ago when I went to NY, and I have no idea why. I thought at that time that it was a random questioning because that was the first time I had travelled alone. Since then, there had been a few incidents where I had been questioned a bit longer than usual at the border but it was nothing compared to this. It had stopped after the last 2 times I had visited the US so I thought I was fine. After those last 2 times, I hadn’t really had to go through the US or visited so I had a nice quiet period until today.

The officer had informed me that I was being questioned because of my “big number of no shows for flights” and asked me about every trip I’ve made to and through the US. He said he’s asking me all these questions to make sure my story is right…. Whatever that means. I had told him there was only 2 incidents I could think of that was a “no show”. One being me booking another flight a few days before my current one to go home earlier. The other being that I had missed the fight because I didn’t make the baggage check in time but had still gotten on the flight right after. The officer said that it doesn’t show my on my record the reason why there’s a no show but it just shows multiple no shows. I don’t even know what the other number of no shows would’ve been but now with this on my file I don’t even want to set foot in the US again and have to go through this.

Has this happened to anyone?

1k1hi3f,reddit,Istanbul has gone over the edge as an enjoyable vacation destination.  It is legitimately nothing more than a nuisance now,"The last time I was there in 2017 it was borderline..........I was thinking ""maybe I just had a bad experience"" and to not write off the city entirely.  That time I at least got to check down on many of the important tourism sites and could tune out a lot of the ""buy my leather, buy my carpet, buy my jewelry"" crap.  This time, I tried to ""do more local stuff"" hoping to get away from that........oh no, the merchants still aggressively swarm you as if you are fresh meat in a zombie apocolypse movie.  Additionally, the outright harassment of my wife, whom Im well aware is attractive.  There is absolutely no shame in their approaches to her even when we are together.  Probably nearly got in a fight a dozen times.  I am a nice person by nature, but for the first time, not only do I have to be outright mean to these sorts of people........I actually got a degree of pleasure shouting them away this time.  Additionally, the carpet, leather, and jewelry guys also simply do not relent now.........""law enforcement"" sees it,  and does absolutely nothing about it (probably because they are getting their cut too).  I challenge you.........as a tourist.......go try and sit on a bench by Blue Mosque.  If you can make it one minute without a hustler trying to sell you their shit, that would be slightly impressive.

The last day we legitimately stayed in the hotel room the whole time and didnt leave the hotel property.  We got our scam taxi back to the airport and emphatically agreed ""never again"".  I actually feel like quite the dumbass for talking myself into returning because my wife hadnt seen the sites.

I dont need to go back.  To people in Turkey, you are just nothing more than a tourist who deserves a financial shakedown.  They could care less what they think about their city now, perhaps more than ever.  Turkish hospitality as it was once known and revered is absolutely dead.  This goes doubly if you are a remotely attractive woman.........you will harassed even if you are with your significant other.  If you are single?  Hell.........God/Allah/Krishna/Bhudda help you........you're in for a hell of a ride.  I cannot imagine how nightmarish that would be for a single woman.

Pittsburgh - This American metropolis of 2.5 million has beautiful scenery, great pre-war architecture (Cathedral of Learning, Gulf Tower), fun activities (Baseball @ PNC Park, Andy Warhol Museum) and is very affordable.

Puebla - This Mexican metropolis of 3 million has some of the most incredible baroque churches I’ve seen and great food. It’s so close to Mexico City and yet gets little foreign tourism.

Tainan - The Kyoto of Taiwan that seems to be completely ignored outside of Taiwanese. Very historic and beautiful pictures with historic structures next to palm trees and mangroves.

Turin - A very affordable Italian city with a classy vibe, some incredible museums (Egyptian Museum, National Museum of Cinema, National Museum of the Automobile)

We passed through many garbage patches like this. This is supposed to be a UNESCO world heritage site. I am deeply regretful to have participated in this. I was under the impression that, like most other places, there would be policies in place to limit environmental degradation - such as limit on number of visitors/day, limit on number of boats. It doesn’t appear there is any such measure in place. You absolutely cannot swim in the water. You’ll see plastic bottles and diapers floating next to you when you go kayaking. There will be enormous lineups of hundreds of tourists at every stop the cruise stops at. There are hundreds of cruise ships in the water. The staff on your boat may even fish in this water and feed it to you for dinner.

1jsuona,reddit,Scary scams in Istanbul we experienced - beware,"My friend and I went to Istanbul a few weeks ago. I am making this post to warn people about these scams and to make sure you know what you're getting into if you decide to go to Istanbul. Be safe. I have traveled all over the world and never experienced scams like this. Istanbul can be scary.

One of the scams that really scared my friend and I was the police scam. We read about this scam before we went. We were walking on a busy road in Istanbul (on the European side) in the middle of the day. We were approached by a gang of about 5 men. They stopped us and started shouting at us - ""police, police, show us your passports!"". We immediately knew that this was a scam. One of the guys showed us a fake police badge and again demanded we give them our passports. My friend tried to walk away but one of the scammers grabbed him. We told them we didn't believe them and that we will call the police to check. They didn't listen and kept on demanding we show them our passports. After about 5 minutes we told them we don't have our passports on us. They then finally let us go. That was really scary and ruined our entire vacation. We later read that they usually take your passport hostage and demand payment or threaten to damage your passport if you don't pay. The scary thing was, all the locals were watching on and did nothing. 

Another concerning scam was the photography scam. We were taking a ferry across the bosphorous in the afternoon. During the trip we noticed a young woman setting up a table at the front of the ferry seating area. During the trip her and another young woman who seemed to be working for the ferry started approaching passengers on the ferry. They asked us if we wanted pictures and that they will take pictures of us for free. My friend and I knew this was a scam so we declined. The woman didn't seem happy about this. She and the other woman approached a young family of three. A mother, father and a little girl. The family didn't realise it was a scam and allowed one of the photographers to take pictures of them. They then sat down after their pictures were taken. When the ferry ride came to an end, the photographer demanded payment. The family declined and said they don't want any of their pictures. The photographer didn't let them leave the ferry. My friend and I left the ferry and the family was still on the ferry. The family looked afraid. It was clear the photographers were working with the ferry and the crew. We don't know if the family was allowed to leave the ferry or if they were held hostage until they paid up. All we know is they were probably traumatised after the experience.

Lastly, another scam that stood out to us was the tourist scam. It's when a fake tour guide will just start talking to you really fast and force a guide on you. They then demand payment. This happened to us in the mosque. The Turkish man literally tried to scam us in the mosque! He also showed us a fake tour guide badge. He got really annoyed when we walked away.

We enjoyed some of the food there and the mosques, but be careful, I've never experienced scams like this. The scammers can be very aggressive. It feels almost lawless in Istanbul. We saw lots of elderly and female tourists being targeted. In my opinion it's not safe for some people to go. If you do decide to go, go in a group and have some men with you. Istanbul is also expensive now. Food and tickets for places like palaces are very expensive.

1jz1p26,reddit,A week in Rome,"These pictures are from February of this year: the Forum, Galeria Borghese, Circus Maximus, Mercato Testaccio, the Forum (from the POV of Palatine Hill), St. Peter’s Basilica, Capitoline Museum, and Piazza Navona. The other pics were just cool shots from around Monti, Testaccio, and one of the bridges across the Tiber.

Honestly, I was pleasantly surprised how manageable the crowds were given the Jubilee year. The busiest attractions were Trevi Fountain and the Vatican Museums, but even then, I don’t imagine that it was much more crowded than how it is during peak season any other year. 

I stayed for 9 days / 8 nights including a day trip, and I think that was plenty of time to see most things at our leisure, take side quests to explore without feeling rushed, and have a couple slow days to just eat, drink, and shop. We probably could’ve hit more things that were lower on our list, but at a certain point it’s easy to get a little history and culture overload that makes it difficult to appreciate everything to the full extent. For example, the Capitoline was great in its own right but paled in comparison to the Borghese and Vatican galleries that we went to during other parts of the trip. Same with different ruins and historical sites; I knew there was more to see, but after seeing the most popular spots and a day trip to Pompeii, we weren’t really motivated to see the things that were further out or cost money (the Appian Way, Baths of Caracalla, etc). Both my friend and I do expect to come back to Rome someday though. 

I came home with some leather goods and a moka pot. I found that my boots and the Bialetti cost roughly the same as in the US, but no-name brand purses from the touristy leather shops around town felt like a deal. For €134, I got two handbags and a wallet, so given it being real leather, I feel like that’s pretty good compared to what’s available to me at home for the same price.

If I had to do it again, I’d probably book a multi-city plane ticket rather than a round trip one and take the train to add another city in, but it was still a great trip!",2025-04-14 15:29:16,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,1830,41,,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jz1p26,JCOhMyBuddha
1jqgroa,reddit,HELP PLEASE- Left Passport on plane and being told they are going to send me home.,"I just flew on TAP Air 204 from EWR to Lisbon. I left my passport and wallet in my seat back pocket. I messed up big time. I am sitting in the police holding station in the airport. They are telling me no one has found my passport. It was in the seat back pocket, 100%. Now I am just sitting here feeling hopeless. They are saying they are going to send me back today. Does anyone have any advice??? Is there any TAP air number I can call??? All the ones I have called have done nothing. Just forwarded me to someone else. Please help. I am devestated.


*UPDATE*
Holy Hannah this post blew up. Supporters, thanks for the support and advice. Haters, I deserve it. Bonehead move on my part. I just landed back at Newark, waiting to get off plane. I was pretty much completely denied being allowed to talk to TAP while in Lisbon. Hopefully I can speak to a gate agent here and get some info. The plane I was on went back to Newark after my flight, and I am hopelessly hoping it was on that flight and made it back here... if so, I'm getting on the 1050 flight back😂. If not, I secured an 8am passport appointment in the city tomo morning. If all goes well, hopefully I can get on the 5pm out of Newark tomo and meet my lady to salvage some of our trip! Also, still need to hope I make it through customs at a reasonable hour tonight. Global Entry, its your time to SHINE.

*UPDATE 2*
Global Entry for the W. Walked right back into the U S of A, no questions asked. Not one form of ID on me. TAP in EWR was just as useless, call this email that, no one could give a shit and I no longer have the energy to push. Going home and getting some sleep, then passport place in the AM. Also, TAP seemed to cancel my flight home because I flew home today... seems kinda fair but also kinda BS. Any advice on that? Should I just eat my loss and rebook round trip? Sorry if my wording right now is confusing I am delerious.


*UPDATE 3* For anyone still curious... I got my passport at 2pm in NY today. Made the 535pm flight to lisbon out of ewr. Currently in the customs line in Lisbon. Wish me luck!

1jvavr4,reddit,Someone explain Denver to me. Visited again and I don’t know if I’m doing it ”wrong”.,"
Like, I just visited yet again… and it’s a place I should love! Like it checks all these boxes for things I like or am interested in. 

The best way I can describe it is it’s like the hospital of cities. Sure it’s clean, it feels relatively safe, people are generally welcoming… but all in the same way a hospital is sterile, like it’s not welcoming and inviting, it feels like I’m in a sims game when I’m there, just sorta bland and dystopian.

I walked much of the city, kinda was based around “Lodo”… never ate at the same place twice, tried to avoid travel guide suggestions, I tried to find input from locals instead.

EDIT: you all make perfect sense clarifying that the allure of Denver is the mountains and nature surrounding, maybe I approached it wrong as I live at the base of a mountain already so I was looking at Denver as purely a city experience.

EDIT2: a bit more context of some of the US cities I’ve visited and the vibes I’ve gotten from them. 
-New York, Chicago and Detroit has that grittiness of a city.
-Boston (my favorite city) has a sort of coziness for me, it’s a city but feels like a town.
-Miami is sorta vibrant even tho a lot of the people are pretty closed off.
 -Atlanta is a bit dirtier and grimy (probably how Chicago or Detroit would feel if it was stuck in the wet heat of the south)",2025-04-09 17:03:11,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,1736,587,,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jvavr4/someone_explain_denver_to_me_visited_again_and_i/,nooneshome00

1jp2tsw,reddit,"London, just like what I imagined","Just went to London last weekend. Here are some personal experiences and suggestions

The British Museum: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

The best museum I’ve ever been to. All kinds of artifacts from all over the world. You feel like you’re really close to them because many of them are unprotected. You could easily touch them (Not recommended). I saw a kid just climb onto a 3,000-year-old artifact, and I was shocked.

Tips: You don’t have to wait outside for the security check if you don’t bring any bags. Just tell them you don’t have bags, and they will let you in.

Tower Bridge: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Went there at night. It’s a lot bigger than I thought and it’s so beautiful.

Tips: Wear more clothes when you walk on the bridge. It’s very cold.

London Tower: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

A historic castle, and it’s right next to the Tower Bridge. You can see some royal armour and what a castle looks like. The castle life isn’t as good as I imagined. The doors are short, and the passages are very narrow. The most interesting part is that you can see all the kings and queens’ crowns. The crown jewels are so beautiful, but no photos are allowed. Unique experience.

Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, London Eye, and Hyde Park: ⭐⭐⭐

Buckingham Palace is not open now. All you can do is take a picture. Same as Big Ben, take a picture. But they are landmarks, so you should go, just nothing there. The London Eye and Hyde Park are really not recommended. You can find sky wheels and parks like these anywhere in the world.

The National Gallery: ⭐⭐⭐

It should be 5 stars for artists, but I’m not. The paintings are great, and it feels different when you see them in person than when you see them in pictures. Also, many paintings' sizes are a lot larger than I thought. They all have the same size in the pictures. 😂 You should go if you have time.

The Natural History Museum: ⭐⭐

Only recommended if you have kids. Maybe kids like it. It’s so huge but very empty. Just like any natural history museum in the world. There’s nothing special about it.

Fish and Chips: Zero Star

Do not try it. Very expensive, 22 ₤, but it tastes worse than the cheap frozen cod from Costco, and the chips are worse than the fries from McDonald's.

Summary:

I like this city. The English accent is easier to understand than in other UK cities. Two days are enough to visit most attractions in London if you just want to take some pictures and see some famous stuff.

Public transportation is very convenient. You can use Apple Pay to go anywhere.

You can feel you’re in London when you see people wearing stylish clothes. It was around 10 degrees, and I saw so many girls wearing shorts or skirts on the street when I felt so cold in trousers. Probably should go there when the weather is warmer.

I used ChatGPT to find the recommended museums in London, as shown in the last picture. It was good for museums and attractions but not very good for finding restaurants, which recommended pizza in London 😂

I would absolutely recommend London for traveling👍",2025-04-01 18:24:26,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,1677,254,,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jp2tsw,jason_houdini

1jz6ts7,reddit,"Etihad's ""Free Stopover"" turned into a stressful trap – extremely disappointed","I wanted to share a frustrating experience with Etihad that turned what should've been a cool Abu Dhabi stopover into a really disappointing situation.

I recently booked an international flight directly through Etihad’s official website. While booking, I selected the “Free Stopover in Abu Dhabi” option – the promotion that gives you up to 2 complimentary nights in a hotel. I also spoke with two customer service agents who confirmed I was eligible.

Now, after finalizing the booking and trying to reserve the hotel, they’re suddenly saying I have to pay for it. I’ve spoken with several agents since then, and each one gives me a different explanation – some say I’m eligible, some say I’m not, and no one can give me a clear answer. It’s been incredibly stressful, time-consuming, and frankly, misleading.

I feel like I’ve been tricked by a bait-and-switch promo. I even had to write to their data protection office under GDPR to request a full copy of the internal notes and call records, because of how contradictory the communication has been. (Still haven't got it btw)

This whole situation made me lose trust in Etihad, and I want to warn other travelers: if you see that stopover promo — triple check every detail before booking and make sure you get any confirmations in writing.

Has anyone else experienced this? Would love to hear your thoughts or advice.

1jl2jh3,reddit,Lighthearted rant: I never get cake in the vegetarian airplane meals.,"I travel overseas a couple of times a year since I'm in a long distance relationship, and this is slightly heartbreaking every time.

I get the vegetarian meals, and very often they're clearly NOT vegan - they contain cheese and eggs (which is great for me!). BUT I NEVER GET CAKE. I only get the fruit bowl. I can see my neighbors devouring their delicious brownies and apple cakes and GET SO SAD. Worse, I sometimes lose out even more since half of my fruit bowl is melons of some sort. Pineapple, strawberry, grapes - awesome. Honeydew?? MISS ME WITH THAT SHIT.

WHY DON'T I GET CAKE?? I WANT CAKE :(( I know there's sometimes lard in cakes BUT MOST OFTEN NOT. GIMME CAKE. WTF ;\_;

edit: I mentioned they're clearly not vegan since it makes sense for the vegan option not to have cake - it could contain milk/eggs. And that's fine in the vegetarian option so I don't understand why cake isn't included there.

also: One time I did ask for cake and they said ""sorry"" and didn't give me any. And it took a couple of trips to muster up the courage to do so since I'm socially anxious so I probably will try again in a couple of years :')",2025-03-27 12:17:20,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,1118,260,,0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jl2jh3/lighthearted_rant_i_never_get_cake_in_the/,sworn2carrymyburdens

1js9toe,reddit,"Marrakech, Morocco","This February, I spent a few days in beautiful Marrakech, Morocco. From a tourist perspective, the city is mainly a large medina (old town) surrounded by medieval walls. Most of the main sights are located within this area.

My favorite landmarks were the Ben Youssef Madrasa (a historic Islamic university) and the Koutoubia Mosque—though, unfortunately, non-Muslims aren’t allowed to enter the latter. The biggest square, Jemaa el-Fna, is an intense experience. It’s mostly filled with stalls or carpets covered in souvenirs and other goods. There are also plenty of snakes and monkeys, though sadly, their living conditions aren’t great. Close to the square is the touristy section of the souk—colorful and vibrant, selling all sorts of trinkets. It can get a bit overwhelming, especially with the constant need to dodge bikes and motorcycles.

Interestingly, this tourist-heavy zone is really just a central strip of the medina. As you move toward the edges—around places like the old Jewish cemetery, the synagogue, and the tanneries—it quickly becomes more local. The colorful, ornate shops selling mugs, teapots, carpets, and sweets fade into market stalls offering fish (always surrounded by cats lol), meat, vegetables, and fruit. I actually enjoyed this side more

Outside the medina, the only major sight is Jardin Majorelle, a botanical garden surrounding the famous blue Cubist villa, filled with cacti and other plants. I definitely recommend reserving tickets in advance—entry is limited, and you likely won’t be able to buy tickets at the entrance.

While many people warn about tourist scams, I found my experience to be quite different. Overall, people were very welcoming. Sellers weren’t as pushy as in Tunisia (at least in my experience). The only annoying thing was that if you looked lost, someone would immediately offer to “help” you—for a tip, of course. But usually, a simple “La, shukran” (No, thank you) solved the issue. We even visited the tanneries, which get terrible reviews on Google Maps, without paying anything to self-proclaimed guides standing around the entrance.

Overall I really liked the city, I enjoyed it much more than our daytrips in Morocco (Imlil and Ouzoud waterfalls). It is sometimes bit dirty and loud, but nothing overwhelmingly annoying. The food is also excellent. Just bring cash, even the main tourist sights (excluding Jardin Majorelle) mostly demanded payment in it.",2025-04-05 18:17:11,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,893,20,,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1js9toe,AMSparta17
1jptnu7,reddit,"A week in Rome, February 2025","February was a perfect time to explore the city. It was in the high 50s or even 60 degrees most days. Some days we didn’t even need coats as long as we had a sweatshirt or sweater on. The crowds were only really bad at the really famous sights, but we alleviated that as best we could by booking the earliest entry tickets we could get.  Usually 8am.  We had a great Airbnb right near the Tiber River across from Castel San Angelo in a quiet area with fun alleyways to explore along with plenty of shops, gelato and cafes. Walking distance to pizza navona, Vatican City, the Pantheon, Spanish steps, trevi fountain, as well as a taxi stand to take us anywhere else we couldn’t walk to.  Prices were very reasonable for eating and sightseeing.  Roman cuisine is excellent. The pastas. The organ meats. Cheap wine (10 euro for a liter of house wine). 

I visited Rome 25 years ago after college and I loved it even more the 2nd time as did my wife and kids who were on their first visit.    A week was enough for us, we did heavy sightseeing in the mornings, then would break for lunch and head back to apartment to relax before an afternoon walk to get gelato of do some light sightseeing.   You could certainly do everything in say, 3 days, but we didn’t want such a grueling pace. We did take a separate day trip to Pompeii and Naples one day.  I will post photos of that separately.

My parents (both about to be in their 70s) decided to go on a vacation in Japan on their own to spend some quality time with each other.

Their itinerary was from Canada to Tokyo (Air Canada), then Tokyo to Osaka (JAL).

They left for a flight yesterday and today my mom sent me an email telling me that they’ve missed flight because they got separated at immigration checkpoint and couldn’t find each other.

Thankfully they did eventually find each other, and have arrived at their final destination, but they took a bullet train instead.

Worrying that this might void their returning flight, I called Air Canada and they told me that they haven’t received a no show notice from JAL yet so as of now it hasn’t been cancelled (but they may receive it in the future, which will void the return ticket).

Is there way to prevent their returning tickets from being cancelled?

1jr0doa,reddit,Trip to Moldova and Romania,"Spent two weeks in March exploring a bit of Moldova and Romania. My trip started in Moldova, where I spent about 4 days in Chișinău. The city itself doesn't take too long to explore and I'd say 1,5 days are enough to check most of it.

After that, I went to Tiraspol. The trip to Transnistria was pretty smooth: I took a marshrutka from Chișinău to Tiraspol, which then stopped at the border between Moldova and Transnistria. There, they checked my passport and asked how long I would stay. Received a piece of paper that allowed to stay for 12hrs and, in Tiraspol, I exchanged some Moldovan lei for Transnistrian roubles and visited most of the places I had previously tagged (it's hard, even with a Moldovan eSIM, to get a proper connection once you pass the border, although there are places with WiFi). I took another marshrutka in the afternoon back to Chișinău.

My last trip in Moldova was to Orheiul Vechi. Just like the trip to Tiraspol, I went to the central bus station in Chișinău and took a marshrutka to the village of Butuceni. From there, it's a short walk to the top of the hill where the old Orthodox monastery is located - the views are incredible from there and worth the visit. Schedules to and from Orheiul Vechi can be found on their website.

Romania:

I took a flight from Chișinău to Bucharest, where I stayed for about 3 days. The city can be a trip of its own and was quite impressed with the size and scale of some of its buildings and avenues.

After Bucharest, I took a train to Brașov. I decided to stay there for 4 days: it included one day in Sibiu and a day tour of Bran and Peleș Castles and Râșnov Fortress. Brașov is a charming city and can also serve as a base for exploring Transylvania. I got to and from Sibiu by train and as for the tour itself, they can be a good alternative to renting a car and still checking some of the main highlights in a limited time.

From Brașov, I went to Cluj - my last stop in this trip. It's a vibrant city and I didn't expect it to enjoy it as much as I did. I stayed for 3 days, including a trip to Salina Turda and another day tour, this time to Sighişoara and Biertan. To visit Salina Turda, I took a bus from Cluj to Turda and then walked from Turda's city centre to the old entrance of the salt mine. The Turda Salt Mine is impressive and a great option to spend half a day if you have some time to spare in Cluj. Sighişoara is also really worth a visit.

There's very good surf along the coast, if that's your thing. We found the beaches of La Libertad to be better for swimming since it's not as rocky as the others.

Overall, I really enjoyed my time there. My family and I felt safe throughout the trip and there's a big police/military presence for security. There's construction all throughout the country and it seems as if they're making improvements everywhere to bolster tourism. Driving was a breeze there and their official currency is USD and Bitcoin. Feel free to ask any questions.

I wanted to share my disappointing experience in Prague. Over the last three days, I visited the city and was really enjoying my time there. I thought it would be a great place for peaceful walks, and I even considered coming back for weekend strolls. However, on the third day, I experienced something that has left me feeling deeply upset.

That morning, I was physically assaulted by a man. He grabbed my scarf from behind and yelled at me. Despite the tram being full of people, no one reacted or helped. I suspect that this might have been a racially motivated attack, as I wear a headscarf. A friend who has lived here before told me that, although sad, such incidents are unfortunately common because of the high level of Islamophobia.

While I've faced verbal abuse on previous trips (only in Europe!), this physical attack was terrifying, and I am still shaken by it. I am now left with a sense of unease, and I am disappointed that this is how I will remember what otherwise seemed like a beautiful city.

1jmyb7a,reddit,2 weeks in Japan: An in-depth review,"33M from Los Angeles, CA. I visited Japan for the first time last November on a 2-week solo trip.

I stayed at hotels in the following cities, traveling by train:

**Tokyo** (5 nights, Akasaka) – It feels massive, almost infinite. But it’s also very safe, tidy, and easy to get around. There are lively pockets, but quiet ones too. There’s a uniformity to the city, yet each neighborhood has a unique personality. Tons to discover here just wandering.

* **Highlights:** Skytree, Tokyo Tower, Pokémon Cafe & Centers, Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building light show, Sensō-ji, Meiji Jingu, Shinjuku, Shibuya, Harajuku, Akihabara, Ueno
* **Day Trip: Yokohama** – Surprisingly chill big city. Chinatown and the waterfront are fun to explore. Cool variety of architectural styles. The skyline is beautiful, especially at night.

**Kyoto** (3 nights, Mibubojocho) – Favorite city in terms of sights. Very spiritual-feeling with all the temples, shrines, and gardens. Public transit is a bit more challenging than other cities, but it works if you plan well.

* **Highlights:** Kinkaku-ji, Ginkaku-ji, Nijō Castle, Fushimi Inari Taisha, Arashiyama Bamboo Forest, Kiyomizu-dera night viewing, Giō-ji, Yasaka Pagoda, Higashiyama Ward, Nanzen-ji
* **Day Trip: Uji** – The Nintendo Museum has an amazing collection of video game box art, console prototypes, company history, and cute photo-ops. Nearby Byōdō-in is a fantastically picturesque temple. 

**Osaka** (3 nights, Shinsaibashi) – Similar aesthetic to Tokyo, but smaller and grittier. Lots of character. You’ll run into idol groups performing for fans, spirited kushikatsu cooks, and even quirky animatronic dinosaurs.

* **Highlights:** Osaka Castle, Shitennō-ji, Umeda Sky Building, Dotonbori, Shinsekai, Tsutenkaku, Abeno Harukas, Daimaru Nintendo Store, Pokémon Centers
* **Day Trip: Nara** – Very ancient-feeling. Tōdai-ji and Hōryū-ji are incredible. The Nara Park deer are very cute, but will hoover your crackers. Watch out for their droppings too.
* **Day Trip: Himeji** – Stopped here between Osaka and Hiroshima for four hours. Easy luggage storage in train station lockers. Himeji Castle dominates the town and is well worth the visit. The castle has elegant architecture with sprawling grounds, amazing history, and lovely views. 

**Hiroshima** (2 nights, Hatchobori) – Calmer and quieter than other cities, yet still active. You feel the weight of the city’s history, but also inspired by how it’s rebounded. The hills, forests, and water features of the Chūgoku region are beautiful. Being here felt moving and important.

* **Highlights:** Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, Peace Park, Hiroshima Castle
* **Day Trip: Miyajima** – Gorgeous setting with the mountains, trees, and bay. The floating torii has a very “edge of the world” feeling. The island is relaxing in the evening, with neat lighting and deer roaming around.

**Food & Drink:**

* On the US dollar, meals are cheap. You can get a full dinner and alcoholic beverage for \~$12.
* Department store and mall food courts offer fantastic meals. Izakaya are a cozier option.
* Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki edges out Kansai-style for me, but both are great.
* Akashiyaki with tuna flakes was a highlight. Octopus tastes more like pork than squid.
* Ramen and sushi can vary widely in quality. 
* Ekiben taste remarkably fresh for boxed meals.
* 7/11 snacks are delicious with amazing variety. The chocolate-covered banana ice cream Monaka was my favorite, along with the pickled plum rice ball.
* Other standout sweets include ohagi, momiji manjū, Galbo Choco, and Planet Mousse balls.
* The pride taken in food presentation is very much appreciated.
* Of the big three Japanese beers – Sapporo, Kirin, Asahi – I think Sapporo is best.
* I prefer sake warm and sweet. Iced plum wine is also great.
* Vending machines being everywhere is so convenient. Warm royal milk tea and cold orange tea were highlights.

**General Thoughts:**

* Japanese people are very polite and helpful! Even without me asking, locals would do things like pull my luggage off the rack at my train stop, show me where to hang my coat, etc.
* English is not widely spoken, but there are lots of signs in English, Chinese, and Korean.
* Learning a bit of Japanese (Sumimasen, Arigatō gozaimasu) will enhance your experience.
* School kids on field trips practicing English with me was really endearing.
* The abundance of clean public toilets with bidets and white noise is incredible.
* Public baths are a great local way to unwind in after a long flight or sightseeing day.
* The expectation of silence on public transport is so relaxing.
* The omnipresence of cute characters is delightful.
* Konbini always have what you need despite limited inventory.
* How do all the clothing stores stay in business? There are so many!
* The tradition of covering Jizō statues with bibs and hats is especially touching.

**Tips:**

* Business hotels are a great bang for your buck. Impressive use of limited space.
* If you can’t get a reservation at Tokyo’s Pokémon Cafe, try the standby line. I arrived at 6pm on a Tuesday and was seated in 20 minutes.
* Fall is a great time to visit. Ginkgo and maple foliage are stunning, and crowds were manageable at most sights (Kiyomizu-dera being the exception).
* Be ready for rain. Umbrella bags outside many public buildings are handy.
* Consider an uncrowded night visit to Fushimi Inari Taisha. Look out for tanuki.
* If you want to see Mt. Fuji, book a right-side seat on a Tokyo > Kyoto train, or a left-side seat on a Hiroshima > Tokyo flight. Clouds may obscure your view.
* Google Maps works well, but it’s very easy to get lost in the maze of department stores.
* IC cards are convenient for transit, vending machines, etc. I used digital Suica on my iPhone.
* Shinkansen tickets: Smart EX wouldn’t take my American credit cards, so I reserved tickets through JR West. Had to print them in person at a JR kiosk once I arrived in Japan.

**Budget:**

* Total: $3650
   * Flights: $1400 via All Nippon Airways (LAX to NRT, direct; HIJ to LAX, layover in HND)
   * Hotels & Airbnbs: $1460 (Kyoto most expensive, Tokyo and Osaka surprisingly cheap)
   * Train Tickets Between Cities: $160 (Tokyo-Kyoto & Himeji-Hiroshima Shinkansen, local fares via Suica for all other trains)
   * Daily Expenses: $630 (food, sight admissions, Metro/bus/tram fares, shopping, etc.)

**Closing Thoughts:**

Overall, great experience! I would happily return to Japan and explore Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku, etc. Thank you to the people of Japan for making an American feel welcome!

1jrdnvl,reddit,7 days in Taiwan,"First time visiting Taiwan that kicked off a 5 week trip in Eastern Asia. Had never been before, and had really only heard about Taipei. Overall I'm a huge fan, it's a beautiful and lush.  The people are so dang friendly. We were there during a mini heat wave at the end of February, very humid! Made walking around and hiking a little unpleasant but totally worth it in the end. Our plans might seem a bit random but I wanted to get a couple of days without being inundated with crowds, so skipped some of the more famous landmarks outside of Taipei (ex Sun Moon Lake) in favor of meandering through the NE portion of the country for day 5 & 6. Was def our shit, but required a rental car (not a big deal, driving in Taiwan is pretty straightforward). 

Itinerary: 

- Day 1-3: Spent 3 days in Taipei. We stayed in a quiet neighborhood about 2 blocks from the Confusious Temple Complex, worked well for us. Really liked doing the Maokong Gondola and all of the night markets. So much good food in Taipei! 

- Day 4: Rented a car and spent one day making our way over to Jiufen. We spent the first half of the day at Yangmingshan National Park which was a highlight, lot of cool things to see and easy to get around by car. Then went to Houtong Cat Village (meh) and ended at Jiufen. Spending the night felt key there, really enjoyed walking around in the evening without the gridlock crowds. 

- Day 5: Drove along Highway 2 on the coast to Bitoujiao Trail, nice hike that delivers 360 views along the coast. Highly recommend! After we made our way to South to cycle the Old Caoling Tunnel, unique experience that's also worth doing! An old train tunnel that has been converted into a cycling path, goes 4 km and was a nice way for us to escape the heat. Finished our day by making our way to Luodong, spent the night there. Great day!

- Day 6: Slowly made our way back to the Taipei area via Hwy 7, a very lonely, winding mountain road that cuts across the country. Its was a bit impulsive to do it but it was very scenic, not sure I'd recommend for most people though. We love roadtripping so great for us. We stopped at tea gardens and overlooks, the Yixing Suspension Bridge in particular was an unexpected highlight! Ended at Daxi for the night, nice town with a memorable old street.

Day 7: Made our way back to Taipei and flew out to the next stop on our adventure! Can't wait to return one day, beautiful island! ",2025-04-04 14:46:38,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,609,9,,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jrdnvl,chokemypinky
1jzeo44,reddit,I did the Turkish airlines stopover and compiled all the information so you don't have to,"I'm a 27yo solo female traveler who recently did the Turkish Airlines stopover program. I've compiled a list of information because I found the process quite confusing and unclear. 

**What is it?** Turkish airlines offers free hotel accommodation in Istanbul, if your connection period is at least 20 hours. If you are economy class, they offer a 4-star hotel, and 5-star for business class. 

**How do you do it?** 

1. First you need to select a flight that has at least 20 hours of transit time between the two flights. I was flying from Norway to Australia, so having a stopover in a nice hotel seemed like a good option before a 20-hour long haul. I felt this program seemed a little too good to be true, or gimmicky, but decided to try it out anyway. After purchasing your flight, you can email the airline [FREEHOTELAUSTRALIA@THY.COM](mailto:FREEHOTELAUSTRALIA@THY.COM) to book the hotel of your choosing. Here is a list of the hotels they offer for economy:

* Armada Hotel İstanbul
* Eresin Hotels Topkapı
* Grand Cevahir Hotel
* Grand Yavuz Hotel
* Ramada Plaza by Wyndham İstanbul Ataköy 
* Sheraton İstanbul Ataköy Hotel
* Vialand Palace Hotel
* Wish More Hotel Şişli
* Wish More Hotel Bayrampaşa

2. They send you a booking slip to complete, and you fill in your flight number, details, and departure information. **Specify which hotel you want to stay in before you submit the booking slip.** I did not specify, and was put in a random hotel not on the list, which was a little far out from the city. This felt a bit sneaky, as there is nowhere on the booking slip that let's you choose the hotel. If I was to do this again, I would get written confirmation there is availability at the hotel of your choosing, and then submit the booking slip with the hotel of your choosing clearly listed in the email and on the booking slip. I was unable to change my hotel, and the customer service team were very unhelpful. This is a hidden condition in their policy: ""The hotel voucher cannot be changed after it has been issued by the system."" I ended up staying in the Dedeman hotel, and it was pretty average. I think people were smoking in the hotel, as it smelt like musty cigarettes, and the location was not great. You can book a hotel as a group or family - they will accommodate you in the same room. 

3. Once you have received the booking slip, you do not need to contact the hotel to book anything. I just showed up on the day and they had a room booked for me. The airline will not organise any transport for you. Istanbul airport is quite far from the city centre, and a taxi fare is expensive. I took the metro (M11), and it was great. I would highly recommend utilising the public transport to and from the airport, it's reliable, cheap and I felt very safe travelling at night. 

4. **Organise your e-visa.** Not to be confused with a Turkish 'transit visa' (this is unrelated to any stopover or short-stay in Türkiye). You are required to apply for an electronic visa, which was more expensive than I anticipated (yes I should have checked first, but hindsight is bliss - hence this post). My total costs of my visa were USD$66.00 (AUD$104.29). 

**Perks:** Hotel was nice-ish, good inclusions (breakfast was amazing - so much food, gym), lovely staff, check in and check out was convenient for me and they held onto my luggage so I could explore the city. Exploring Istanbul in 22 hours was really fun! Hotels have discounted prices for Stopover passengers. If you want to extend your stay, you can contact the Hotel and get information about the special prices for Stopover passengers.

**Cons:** Expensive e-visa, confusing booking process and inflexibility to change hotel voucher, average hotel far from the city centre - I ended up spending quite a bit on taxis. 

**Miscellaneous tips:** If you are a solo female traveler, I would **not** stay on the European side. I was on this side and it felt a bit sketchy being alone at night, and there appears to be more petty crime. It's also a bit gridlocked taking a taxi from the European side to the Asian side. However, I felt quite safe in Istanbul generally, and just used common sense. Kadıköy feels very safe at night - would recommend exploring nightlife in this region. Turkish airlines offers **student discounted flights.** Register your status as a student in your Miles & Smiles account (provide student ID) and when you search for a flight, select 'Student' as the passenger. Some flights offer student seats which were really affordable! 

**TLDR:** The Turkish Airlines stopover program feels like a gimmick. Once you pay for the e-visa, food, transport etc. the 'money saved' from the free hotel outweighs the money spent. I might do the stopover again, if I could choose my hotel and it was more central.",2025-04-15 00:36:26,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,603,43,,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jzeo44/i_did_the_turkish_airlines_stopover_and_compiled/,negomi_69
1jpr45a,reddit,Spring skiing trip to Switzerland 🇨🇭,"We went to Andermatt-Sedrun-Disentis, Zermatt and Wengen Jungfrau region. It’s absolutely amazing experiencing the Swiss mountain infrastructure in winter. The views were incredible everywhere, we were above the clouds many times. The highlight was definitely skiing from Matterhorn Glacier Paradise to Cervinia in Italy. And skiing from Mannlichen down toward Grindelwald valley. We ended the trip with a few days back in the city exploring Lucerne, Zurich and Basel. 

While Switzerland is the most expensive European destination for skiing (and snow conditions were pretty average or poor overall) the views and easy transportation experience made it 100% worth it. 

Hope this report helps anyone trying to plan a ski trip to Switzerland! Happy to answer any questions. 

**Day 1-2 Andermatt:**
Flew into Zurich and took a train to Andermatt. The next day we skied **Andermatt-Sedrun-Disentis**, a series of interconnected resorts. Lots of traversing but a nice variety of views along the way which got better toward Disentis. Taking the train back from Disentis was also a unique experience. It is on the Glacier Express route, so it’s pretty special to experience that section between Andermatt and Disentis both on the mountain and in the valley. Andermatt the old town itself is very quiet, we stayed in the new town which also seemed empty (partly under construction and only a few shops and restaurants open at the moment - but it’s funded by Vail so I think they will develop it into a shopping/apres village). For dinner we had raclette and Swiss mac and cheese at **Oschen**. Swiss mac and cheese is a must try - they add potatoes and crispy fried onions, and serve it with a side of applesauce. 

**Day 3-5 Zermatt:**
Took the train from Andermatt to Zermatt, which also follows the Glacier Express route. On the first day in Zermatt we didn’t ski but took the **Gornergrat** train up the mountain. Had lunch on the outdoor terrace of **Alphitta** with the view of the Matterhorn (great vibes with live music). We got super lucky with mostly clear weather, and occasional clouds. On the second day we headed straight for **Matterhorn Glacier Paradise** and skied into **Cervinia**. It was incredible. Make sure you go up the viewing platform at the top station before heading into Italy. Had lunch in Italy and skiied back. The next day we started from **Sunnegga** funicular to go to **Rothorn** side, which had incredible views as well, but still went over to Italy for lunch because the food is great and cheap. Our favorite was **Chalet Etoile** which is self-serve with great pastas, and a large outdoor sun deck. 

**Day 7 Wengen, Lauterbrunnen, Murren, Schilthorn:**
This was a big travel day from Zermatt to Wengen, after dropping our luggage at the hotel we did a day trip up to **Schilthorn**. Started by taking the cable car from **Lauterbrunnen** to **Grutschalp**, train to **Mürren**, then walked through Murren to the other cable car station to go to **Schilthorn**. While it was cloudy in the valley, Schilthorn was above the clouds and stunning! It was like being on an airplane. We saw lots of skiers going down the mountain. Got to sit in the rotating restaurant and eat an ice cream. There’s still a lot of construction now, when it’s all done it will be a much better experience. For the way back down we took the cable car to **Stechelberg** and bus back to Lauterbrunnen through the valley.

**Day 8 Grindelwald-First, Kleine Scheidegg:**
We lucked out with a beautiful sunny day skiing above the clouds. Took the cable car from Wengen to **Mannlichen** and skiied partway down to **Grindelwald**, and then we went up to **First**. With the ski pass you can ride on First Glider/Rider for free, there was no line, so we did that, so much fun! However most of the lower mountain has no snow so we did not do a lot of skiing (but the views are worth it). Then took the **Eiger Express** up to **Eigergletscher** and skiied some more. Had lunch at **Restaurant Grindelwaldbleck** (rosti, weisswurst, beer and chocolate cake — all delicious). All in all it was an amazing day with incredible views throughout. Saw many locals up on the mountain that day. 

**Day 9 Kleine Scheidegg:**
Second ski day was snowing and wet without any views but some nice powder runs in the morning around Kleine Scheidegg and Mannlichen. Eventually the visibility got really bad with full whiteout conditions. In hindsight we were very very lucky on all our prior ski days for the clear weather. We skiied to Brandegg to try the apple donuts at the **Bergrestaurant Brandegg**, but otherwise finished the ski day early. 

**Day 10 Lucerne:**
After a long time up in the mountains it was nice to return to the city and lake side. Spring was in full swing at Lucerne with flowers blooming and warmer weather. We took a ferry to **Vitznau**, then a bus and train back toward Lucerne. Attended a concert at KKL and then cooked dinner at home with pesto, ravioli, chicken and wine from **Coop** (which was surprisingly tasty, one of our best meals!)

**Day 11 Zurich and Basel**
Went to Zurich in the morning and had breakfast at **Confiserie Sprungli**. Visited **Lindt Home of Chocolate**. Then spent the afternoon at the **Hurlimannbad & Spa** (much needed relaxation to end our trip). For the evening we went to **Basel**, explored the riverfront and town, had chocolate cake and hot cocoa at **Xocolatl** and had dinner at **Markthalle (Flavors of Jerusalem).** 

Tips:
- We bought a Half Fare Card and Saver Day Passes to save money on trains. Got the discount to go up Schilthorn for only $50 per person
- We managed just fine bringing our own skis onto all the trains. This saved a lot of money and time from renting at each resort. The hotels usually have spaces to store your skis (or offer a free ski depot nearby).
- Budget lots of time for sit down restaurants (they can take forever, especially dinner). Otherwise just get simple food from cafeterias or to-go options if you want to spend more time sightseeing and exploring (and save some money)
- If you can afford it book a hotel with a wellness spa, or a room with a bathtub, if you are skiing
- Check which days things are open or closed. A lot of stuff is closed on Sundays, but also sometimes Monday or Tuesday. ",2025-04-02 15:16:01,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,597,15,,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jpr45a,sirotan88

1k0nolw,reddit,"A week in St. Lucia, a review","My gf and I went to Saint Lucia for a week this past New Year’s. I did a lot of my research by reading through old posts in this sub so I figured I’d write something up in case someone will find it useful in the future.

**Hotel**

We decided to stay in the Soufriere area in the south of Saint Lucia the entire time after reading about people who split their time between north and south preferring the south. Stayed at Samfi Gardens just north of Soufriere town (found from this sub). The room was a bit dated and the drive to/from the hotel every day was a bit rough (literally), but honestly not much to complain about – it was very reasonably priced and the view was *insane* (Photos 1 and 2 were taken from our balcony in the room and Photo 3 is of the hotel grounds). Everyone was super nice, the outdoor space was cool, comfy bed, cold A/C, etc. I’d def recommend the hotel overall.

**Transportation**

After reading about how bad the roads were, we decided not to rent a car and just take taxis / local drivers everywhere. This ended up costing a lot and if you want to save money and rent a car, I get it. But we do not regret our decision. The roads are *bad*. Even the roads that are decent quality pavement are super narrow with dropoffs, steep, lots of blind turns, and if you’re coming from the US you’d also be driving on the opposite side of the road. Some roads like the road from Soufriere to Jade Mountain / Anse Chastanet are probably the worst roads I’ve ever been on in my life – more pothole than road. I would have had a heart attack if I was driving.

Shout out to Swanson, Devon, and Whitney of Golden Ticket SLU who drove us to/from the airport and on a few pre-planned excursions around town, and also Nico and Toyan from Big T Taxi (recommended by the hotel) for more of the to/from dinner or to/from the beach kind of trips. Everyone communicates via Whatsapp and is super responsive.

**Food**

We went to a variety of places, from hole in the wall local places to resort restaurants. A lot of the food was very similar - fish or chicken with a large assortment of small sides that came with the protein. Most of it was very good, but nothing to write home about. There were two main outliers in my opinion.

Treetop Restaurant was incredible. An Indian multi-course menu in an outdoor restaurant set in a labyrynth of wooden patios and staircases up in the trees. The food was excellent, the mixologist made two amazing and very different cocktails just based off descriptions of what we liked, and the vibe was great. It was an awesome, very unique experience. Photo 4 was taken from our table.

On the other end of the spectrum, we were very excited for Rabot Restaurant at Hotel Chocolat and saved it for the last night of our trip. We already had lunch at a different place at the resort (included with the Tree to Bar tour where we made our own chocolate) and that was great, so our expectations were high. It turned out to be easily the worst meal of our trip, while also being the most expensive. Maybe we didn’t order the right things, but practically every part of the meal was just straight up bad, including the drinks.

**Sightseeing**

This was our first Caribbean island, and I picked it because I wanted to have stuff to do besides just laying on the beach.

We did a private ""Waterfall Chasing"" excursion with Father Nature. This didn’t get off to a great start as the guy asked if we were up for a tough hike and we said sure! I proceeded to completely eat it down a wet and slippery slope about 15 min in. I guess I assumed a tough hike would still have somewhat of a real path, and wouldn’t need to be hacked with a machete. Thankfully we decided to quit while we were behind and he took us on two much more chill and shorter hikes to two beautiful waterfalls (photos 5 and 6). Not only did we not see a single other tourist on either of these hikes, we didn’t see a single other person period. Hung out at the end destinations for a while, took a dip, ate a coconut. It was very cool, felt like we were really out there.

We did a ""Explore Soufriere"" day with Golden Ticket SLU where they drove us around to all the nature sites near Soufriere - all pretty close to each other and very doable in one day:

* Tet Paul Nature Trail (Photos 7, 8): Shockingly great views given how easy and short the hike was. Plus some friendly kitties at the top.
* Sulphur Springs / Mud Baths: Unique experience but insanely crowded and you’re herded like cattle along with bus-fulls of cruise ship passengers on day trips to the south.
* Toraille Waterfall: Really large waterfall that you can get under. Unfortunately, ditto with the tourists, it was super packed. Honestly, not worth it.
* Diamond Falls Botanical Gardens (Photos 9, 10): Pretty botanical gardens that you walk through for a little while until you reach the waterfall - can’t get under this one, the water is gray from the sulphur, but it’s very cool looking. Much less touristy.
* Piton Falls (Photo 12): The water is warm! We hung out in the pools for a while, there were very few people.

We did a private half day sailing excursion with Mystic Man on a beautiful 40 foot sailboat. We were considering the group sunset one, but very happy we went with the private one, especially since we were able to move the start time later in the day to catch the sunset on our way back anyway. The guys were great, took us up the coast a bit before turning around and going to Sugar Beach to snorkel. When we first set off, they were gonna go direct to Sugar Beach but I asked if we could take a more roundabout way so I could get a photo of the Pitons from a specific angle in the water that I wanted (Photo 13) and they were super chill about it. Neither of us had been snorkeling before (and I can’t swim) so I was nervous, but the guys were patient and showed us how to do everything. It was expensive but 100% worth it, probably the highlight of the trip. Also the rum punch was flowing and they gave us a bottle of sparkling wine to take with us since we never cracked it open on the boat.

As far as beaches go, we did Sugar Beach and Anse Chastanet / Anse Mamin beaches. Sugar Beach was spectacular visually being between the Pitons (Photos 15 and 16) so I’m definitely glad we went. But it was super crowded, you couldn’t rent chairs if you weren’t staying there, and there was very little shade otherwise. We only stayed for a few hours. Anse Chastanet and Anse Mamin were much better imo. We rented snorkeling gear and snorkeled at Anse Chastanet, then walked \~10 min along the coast to Anse Mamin (Photo 17), had a very expensive but delicious burger at Jungle Grill, rented two chairs under a palapa with no issue, and chilled the rest of the day. Very few people in comparison to Sugar Beach and the snorkeling was better too. We liked this day so much we went back and repeated it on our last day.

1jxvfcf,reddit,Do you ever regret spending too much on a vacation?,"My wife and I are planning a vacation in September for a week, we’re most likely going to Cabo for a relaxing and luxurious vacation.

I’m really leaning towards splurging on staying at the Esperanza and getting one of the nicer rooms for 6 nights, but it definitely would be like a huge hit to our bank account. We wouldn’t go into debt or clean out our savings or anything like that, but it would just sort of be like “damn we better enjoy this”. We also have decent jobs and make a good monthly income so we could recoup it if we hunkered down on savings for a few months 

I go back and forth in my head about doing it, I’m leaning towards doing it because the thought I keep coming to is “am I gonna regret not going or am I gonna regret spending the money in 10 years?” And I know the answer to that question is regretting not going 

How do you feel about all this? How do you weigh your travel/vacations with your finances? 

Should I just say fuck it and go? Or really consider if it’s worth it?

1jskg1d,reddit,Does anyone find South America unironically more expensive than Europe?,"After having been in these two continents, I was overviewing my expenses in both of them and I realize I actually tend to spend more in South America compared to Europe.  Some of my observations so far:

1. Public transport in Europe is so good.  I can get from places to places so easily just from a quick Google Maps search to find the next available train.  In much of South America, I still have to depend on taxis, tour buses and domestic fights to get from location to location.  I know there are metros in the major cities in South America as well, but it gets a bif iffy sometimes so I still feel more secure taking a taxi in these cities.  This is sort of linked to my second point.
2. It's of no surprise that crime levels in South America is quite a lot higher compared to Europe.  This means that for unexperienced travelers, you might want to pay for private tours to do certain activities if you don't want to be constantly on the lookout.  Europe has it's fair share of pickpockets, but by and large I still find it quite comfortable walking down the streets as long as I keep my belongings secured with me.
3. I also find the general prices of things in South America, in the places tourists will go, tend to be quite on par with Europe.  For example in Rio, I find most of the restaurants along Copacabana and Ipanama at about USD20-25 per pax, which is really not all that different from central London and Paris.  I know you can probably find more affordable prices the further you stray from the tourists places, but the areas start to get shady quite quickly which again goes back to my second point.

Just some of my 2cents.  Really interested to see what other people who's being to both of these regions think.",2025-04-06 02:54:58,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,380,228,,0.79,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jskg1d/does_anyone_find_south_america_unironically_more/,Xycergy
1jseef8,reddit,UK ETA: Beware!,"I recently traveled to the UK with my mom, and although I am an EU citizen, she isn’t. We ran into an unexpected issue with Ryanair that I figured was worth sharing.

As most of us already know, as of this year, any non-UK citizens need to apply for a UK ETA before traveling. We did that for my mom, and her application was approved quickly. The confirmation email clearly stated:

**”When you travel to the UK 
You only need your passport that ends in 0000. 
You do not need to print or show this confirmation email.""**

Sounds simple, right? Well, not according to Ryanair.

Right before boarding our flight to London, Ryanair staff insisted on seeing the ETA confirmation email, claiming it was mandatory. My mom doesn’t have an EU SIM card, so no mobile data to check her emails. To make things worse, she had applied using her work email and didn't realize it at first. Cue 15 minutes of panic while Ryanair refused to let us board.

We finally found the email just in time, but the whole ordeal could have been avoided if we had just saved a copy in advance. So, lesson learned: keep that ETA email handy, as the airline staff might ask for it, even if the UK government says you don't need it.

DISCLAIMER: I understand the reasoning behind requesting this documentation before boarding, and that it is probably a procedure followed by all airlines. Still, it contradicts the official ETA statement so I thought it was worth sharing.

Safe travels!

1jzmr2a,reddit,A month in Maldives,"Stayed on Hulhumale BnB for a month, an island connected to the main capital island - Malé. But we went back and forth to other islands like Maafushi and Sun Siam.

The captial island is a constant construction zone, especially in Hulhumale which is less than two decades old. Also if you're coming during March, the main islands will have closures due to Ramadan (EVERYTHING CLOSES, INCL/ PUBLIC BUSES). Outside of March most shops/public bus normally are closed periodically for scheduled prayer times. On tourists islands like Maafushi/etc, everything is open.

There are two movie theaters on the main island, one on each island with only a single room for showings. There’s a reservation requirement of 10-30pax to show. The public transportation is mostly double decked buses that take Visa/ Mastercard tap-to-pay feature (1USD). The buses travel both the islands, with interesting rules such as not being able to board the bus without walking through the station (Maafannu Bus Terminal).
Hulhumale is a newer island that has only existed for a few decades. As Malé is rapidly sinking, this will be its replacement. There are two major parts of Hulhumale, Phasel and Phase2. Phase1: Houses 1-5 story houses with restaurants and businesses below. Phase2 is completely left for locals, with high rises created to help with the housing crisis Maldives faces. 

All in all, interesting place.

1jzz6xs,reddit,Air France's bogus reasoning for changing our seats,"A little rant. My husband and I had booked a business class flight on Air France from Paris to Singapore. We fly often (not always in business class) but I always choose a window seat. I had as usual made sure to select a window seat when we made the booking for this trip. My husband had booked the window seat behind me. I arrive on the plane and automatically go to the A seats (Window). I knew we had ""A"" seats but were not sure of the numbers so I checked my boarding pass. Lo and behold, it says E, a middle seat. My husband had the seat next to mine, F. The layout of the seats was as follows. A seats, then aisle, E and F seats then aisle, then L seats. A and L are the window seats.

I know in business class a window seat should not matter much like in economy, but I like to take pictures from the window so I was a little miffed. I flagged down a flight attendant and explained that I was pretty sure we had booked window seats and did not understand why it had been changed. He says he was going to look into it and get back to me. He comes back two minutes later and says they changed our seats to accomodate a mother and child. We had booked seats 3A and 4A. I look there and see there is a woman and an older  boy on ""our"" seats . The boy looked to be maybe 15 years . 

Thad did not help me feel better about losing my window seat. What is the logic here? When you say you want to accomodate a mother and her child, I assume you want to seat them together? The mother was now seated behind the child. Could have been understandable if people had been moved to have them seat side by side like in the middle seats. I imagine they just said they wanted window seats and their wish was granted. Not a good enough reason (for me anyways) to displace others who also preferred window seats. Hell, I would have understood maybe if it was a much younger child who was excited to have a window seat. Anyway, maybe I am overreacting.

1jqkt5p,reddit,Day trip to Pompeii and Naples,"I spent a week in Rome with my family in February and we did a Wednesday day trip to Pompeii and Naples.   I have read that it can be a very long day,  if we did not find it to be too bad. 


We got on a train in Rome at 8:06am (I booked it a few weeks in advance and it was a LOT cheaper than if I booked the week of.  I think I saved over 100 euro on 4 tickets by doing so).  We arrived in Naples at 9:13 and had to transfer to the Circumvesiviana train line which is within the Napoli Centrale station, but it was about a 10-15 minute walk to find it. This train line is a much grittier local train line, we bought our tickets on the spot from a friendly English speaking guy in the ticket booth and found our platform. The train departed around 9:50ish. /‘d we arrived at Pompeii Scavi station around 10:25 and met our tour guide there (we found her through a recommendation in Rick Steves’ Rome book. 


We did a 2 hour tour with her which was excellent, then grabbed lunch right in the middle of the ruins up on a hill overlooking the ancient city. The food was good and there were a lot of options. 

The guide pointed out a way to get where which took us up some metal steps and over a metal catwalk that is under a tin roof that had all been erected over a section of the ancient city that is currently undergoing excavation. This was REALLY cool to see.  There were tons of buildings that have just been unearthed after 2000 years that were been cleaned, examined, catalogued etc. you could see the archeologists doing their work. No photos were permitted and there was a guy up there walking around to enforce that.  I was in Pompeii in 2000, so it was really neat to see this work being done now. 


After lunch we made our way back to the train and got on one around 1:45 to head back to  Naples.  We got to Naples around 2:15 and made our way to one of two apparently very famous Neopolitan pizza places that are across the street from each other. We ate at a place called Pizzeria Trianon (be careful there are knockoffs that try to use the same name).  By this time is was about 2:30, so the restaurant was empty except for about 5 other people (I have read that there can be lines out the door at peak times). We sat upstairs and ordered 2 pizzas which you can see in the photos and a bottle of their house red wine.  

It’s times like this that I wish I had a better way with words because I can’t tell you how good this pizza was.  The dough, crust, fresh ingredients ..  momma Mia. They are cooked in old school wood fired ovens, and that fire and heat really gives the pizza an amazing finish and flavor. 

We finished that and had a slow wander back to the train station and hopped on one around 5pm and were back in Rome by 6:15 or so.

My wife and kids loved Pompeii, it is a huge sight and you could literally spend the whole day wandering the streets and alleys if you wanted to. When I went there solo in 2000. 8 did just that. But this time with the kids, the time we spent was plenty, and using the tour guide was a good use of our time (cost 200 euro for 2 hours). When I was solo, I just just a guide book to show myself around at my own pace. But you definitely want a tour guide or a good book so you know what you are looking at. 

Naples was definitely very gritty, but it was a really neat contrast to Rome. No offense to any Italian friends reading this, but Naples smelled like urine in many places around the train station.  But honestly it added to the charm and it was good for the kids to see the rough edges of a really beautiful country. We never felt unsafe at any moment on the train or in the city. 

It was the perfect day trip to break up the week stay in Rome, and as you are on the train from Naples to Pompeii, you are looking out the window and all of a sudden you catch sight of the bay of Naples open up to one side and it’s a truly beautiful view of the bay and surrounding mountains.

1jxpfuz,reddit,What exactly do people mean when they say a travel destination has become americanized/westernized?,"This is something that I have noticed in different comments, posts, and such on social media—that a travel destination has become more americanized/westernized.

Now, touristic cities (places that are catered and/or meant for tourists) are a thing. Like Cancun, as an example.

But, from what I've seen online, the places that people are describing as americanized/westernized are not really the tourism hot spots, but more so, places where either locals once were, or not a lot of tourism was in that area. As time went on, it gets to where there's less locals in said area, tourism increases, and the destination is basically not the same like before.

Now, there are a bunch of travel destinations I've seen described as being americanized/westernized. Places like Bali, Phuket, beach spots in Mexico (Tulum, Sayulita, Isla Mujeres, etc), the Amalfi Coast (for some reason), parts of Costa Rica, etc. I saw a comment state that The Bahamas feels like an extension of Florida, and people have stated how Aruba now feels more like the US.

Another thing I've noticed is that when people describe a travel destination as being more americanized/westernized, it seems to also be places where digital nomads, influencers, expats, entrepreneurs from other countries, etc, all thrive in.

Or even different nationalities. Bali, of course, having a lot of Australians. I even saw a comment where someone said they went to one area of Mexico and saw nothing but Canadians and Canadians flags in the there.

All that being said, what exactly do people mean when they say a travel destination has become americanized/westernized?

Is it:

-Overdevelopment (adding in a lot of hotels and resorts)

-Pricing (going from affordable to expensive)

-People moving in and causing gentrification

-Adding a fast food restaurant or place to the area (ex: someone going for a walk in the mountains and coming across a random Starbucks on the side)

-Having too many crowds

Or maybe even all of the above? Honestly, I'm curious to know the answers to this. And, for any one who has experienced a travel destination that later on became americanized/westernized, what were the signs that made you notice?",2025-04-12 19:35:05,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,239,227,,0.85,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jxpfuz/what_exactly_do_people_mean_when_they_say_a/,Xftg123

It got me thinking, what are your travel superpowers and/or weaknesses?


Me:  

Superpower: 


-Smaller Frame - Can pack more clothes in smaller space or carry better with the same amount of stuff.  Can fit in most places, like smaller airplane seats, cram in to backseats, etc.  

-Sweat resistance - I rarely sweat, if I do, it's usually just my forehead.  I don't use/carry anti-perspirant.  I don't sweat through my clothes, they stay fresher longer.  I do get heat rash though where I should be sweating.  

-Heat tolerance - I am comfortable with higher heat, I can easily wear pants up to 80 degrees Fahrenheit, rarely wear shorts.  


Weaknesses: 

-Cold intolerance - I get cold very easily, once it gets in to the sixties, I'd like at least a hoodie.  

-Constant Hunger - I'm always hungry.  At home, I'm near food and snacks, so that's not a big deal, but traveling, I seem to never pack enough snacks.  Thank goodness for my metabolism.  

-Constant bathroom breaks - I guess having to pee all the time is the crux of good hydration, but it's inconvenient.

Mesopotamian Marshes – Took a shared taxi to the marshes. We had a boat tour arranged via a WhatsApp contact for 10,000 IQD each (others in person quoted us $50!). The guy was incredibly friendly—one of many helpful people we’d meet.

Nasiriyah – Continued on the same day and visited the Ziggurat of Ur—easily one of the highlights of the trip. Slept in the city.

Najaf – Visited the holy shrines and the world's largest cemetery. Despite the language barrier, a former soldier we befriended in the taxi took us around with Google Translate. Highly recommend having the app ready—not many you'll meet will speak English, but many are eager to connect.

Karbala – Arrived the same day and visited the shrines in the evening. The atmosphere was very emotional and we happened to see a few funerals.

Babylon / Hilla – The next morning, we visited Babylonia and Saddam’s abandoned palace, then headed to Baghdad.

Baghdad – Spent two nights. Visited the main highlights, including the Iraq Museum. Military and police presence is strong but we never felt unsafe. My friend wanted to drink... So we found alcohol in hole-in-the-wall shops—bars listed on Google Maps were mostly closed. One funny moment: a police truck rolled by while we were buying drinks and everything shut down in seconds.

Samarra – Left early the next day. At a checkpoint in the city, we were told we needed an escort (safety?) but the ""helpers"" tried to scam us. We ended up walking in on our own. The mosque and spiral minaret were breathtaking 

Mosul – Visited another, lesser-known minaret en route (Abu dulaf, a bit scary to climb if you’re afraid of heights!). Reached Mosul before dark. Next day exploring on foot was an emotional experience—seeing the bullet-ridden walls and post-war reconstruction, yet life carrying on. Playing games with local kids was a heartwarming highlight.

Erbil (Kurdistan) – Arrived in the evening. It felt like a different country—modern, clean, and somewhat reminiscent of Eastern European cities. We went out in the Christian quarter and enjoyed our final night.


Tips & Insights:

People were unbelievably friendly and curious about us. We met many schoolkids who wanted to practise English and take selfies with us.

Tourism is still minimal. The few tourists we saw were in big organised tours and we kept running into the same groups.

Shared taxis are super cheap (usually $5–10 per person) and we were always charged local prices.

Hotels are way cheaper if booked in person. Prices online were often double or triple. We paid $35–45 USD/night on average for a double room; the most we paid was $55 in a fancier place.

Food is generous and meat-heavy. Meals were $5–10 with huge portions and tons of starters—don’t expect to be hungry afterwards.

In total we spent around 500 USD per person for a week (everything included)

Language is a barrier, but nothing Google Translate can’t handle.

Careem (taxi app) can be useful but it doesn't work in every region.

1jq7frm,reddit,Saudi Airlines rescheduled my flight by a full week with just 2 days notice - What compensation am I entitled to and how can I pursue it?,"Hello r/travel !

I'm in a stressful situation with Saudi Airlines (Saudia) and could really use some advice from anyone with similar experiences or knowledge about passenger rights.

Flight Details:
Original Booking: Round trip from Frankfurt to Mumbai

Outbound Flight: Frankfurt → Jeddah → Mumbai (Completed on February 27th)

Original Return Flight: Mumbai → Riyadh → Frankfurt (Scheduled for April 4th, 2025)

Rescheduled Return: Now changed to April 11th, 2025 (7-day delay)

Notification Timing: Received email on April 2nd at 20:06 (less than 48 hours before original departure)

Ticket Cost: Approximately €300 for the round trip + €60 add-on fee

Why This Is Problematic:
As a working professional, this one-week delay is causing significant issues:
I've already arranged my work schedule around my original return date
My employer is expecting me back at work following the original date
I may face financial consequences due to missed work
I need to arrange/pay for additional accommodation in Mumbai for a week

Steps Taken So Far:
Immediately tried to contact their customer service after receiving the notification
Found their online customer service to be essentially non-existent
Attempted calling their customer service line and eventually they responded to contact the airlines office in person.
I'm currently on my way to their physical office in Mumbai to speak with someone in person.

What I Need Help With:
- What compensation am I legally entitled to for such a significant schedule change with minimal notice?
- Are there specific EU regulations that apply since my destination is Frankfurt?
- Can I demand they book me on another airline to get me home closer to my original date?
- Is anyone familiar with Saudi Airlines' specific policies for schedule changes?
- What documentation should I gather to strengthen my case?
- Should I accept the new flight and seek compensation, or refuse it and demand a refund?
- Has anyone successfully received compensation from Saudi Airlines in similar situations?
- Despite the low fare (which shouldn't affect my rights), this last-minute schedule change is significantly disrupting my professional and personal life. 

—> Any advice, personal experiences, or information about passenger rights in this situation would be immensely appreciated.

Thank you in advance for your help!

Edit:

Update & Thanks to Everyone!

Hey folks, just wanted to give you all an update and thank you for all the comments, advice, and suggestions you shared. Your support made a big difference in handling this situation!

So, here’s what happened: I managed to reach the Saudia Airlines office, but it wasn’t an easy task. Their office had changed its address, and neither their website nor Google Maps had the correct information. After some local asking around, I finally figured out their new location and headed there.

Once at the office, I presented all my arguments and concerns. However, they were extremely adamant about sticking to the rescheduled flight and almost forcing me to accept it. I stayed firm and pointed out that flights were available for earlier dates, even though they were business class. Unfortunately, they outright refused to upgrade me to business class despite my situation.

After lengthy discussions and a lot of back-and-forth, I finally managed to convince them to book me on a direct flight to Frankfurt with Lufthansa instead. While I’m relieved about this outcome, there’s a small downside: my upgraded baggage add-on (which I originally purchased) became null and void. They informed me that upgraded add-ons are non-refundable and refused to entertain any refund for that.

Still, considering how stressful this situation was, I’m grateful that it’s resolved, for the most part. I wouldn’t have been able to navigate this without all the helpful advice and encouragement I received here.

Thank you all again, I truly appreciate your time and support. Wishing you all the very best in life.

1jufbrc,reddit,Do You Keep Your Travels Private?,"What I mean is that when you travel and take trips, do you like to tell your friends, family, and coworkers stories when you get back or that you’re going before you leave? Personally, I tend to keep my travels and trips private. Me and my family usually take a big week trip somewhere every year. I also love flying and I’ve taken a bunch of short solo day trips to places or trips literally just to fly around for fun.
I’ll tell my immediate family, but outside of that, I don’t like to tell my coworkers or friends or even post it on social media for fear of other people’s opinions.

Take for example my supervisor at work. He has traveled a ton and has so many stories and photos that he loves to share with me from his trips. As someone who also enjoys traveling and takes many trips, we both get along well enjoy sharing our travel stories. He’s the only coworker who I’ll tell. Right now he’s out of the office for a week as he’s in another country on yet another vacation. Some of my coworkers from another shift yesterday morning didn’t know he was on vacation or out of the country. When I told them, they kind of rolled their eyes and then proceeded to say that he travels all the time and his vacations are crazy. Basically, alluding to how they do a lot on their trips and try to see a lot. These other coworkers went on about how their ideal vacation is to go and lay out on the beach for a week and not to do a lot. My supervisor also has two kids (both are in their teens) and one of these coworkers made a comment about how basically his kids are spoiled to go on so many vacations every year.

It left a bad taste in my mouth and sort of reminded me why I don’t like to tell people about my travels. I tend to get two sides, the people who re opinionated and wonder why I went wherever or did whatever and then the other side of people who don’t seem interested or to care. Is it jealousy you think from other people? That’s at least what I tend to think.

Anyways, what’s your thoughts? Do you like to share your travels, or keep them to yourself for fear of others opinions?",2025-04-08 14:46:13,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,207,168,,0.87,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jufbrc/do_you_keep_your_travels_private/,kgaviation

They waved me through with nothing to sign and I assumed all was good until I see an extra day late charge on my invoice.

1jz86wp,reddit,Airline rebooked my son's ticket without permission,"Hi All, I am hoping to get some advice if possible. My husband, my son and myself are booked to fly to South africa tomorrow from Edinburgh. My son, who booked his ticket separately to us, got a text today to say that he has been booked on a completely different flight from us due to overbooking. this puts a huge spanner in the works as we have a connecting flight from Jo'burg which he'll potentially miss as his new flight arrives a whole 12 hours after ours. We were advised to try on the day (tomorrow) to see if he can still get on the flight anyway (the original flight still shows as available on his KLM app as well as the new flight). The question I guess I have is, is it really worth it for my son to show up that early only to be told he can't fly? We really want to fly as a family, ideally, but I obviously don't want him to spend 24 hours on the road if he can;t get on. If anyone has had this happend to, what was your experience with trying to get on the original booking?  
Thanks ever so much!!

EDIT to say that I have already been on the phone to them, and even went to the airport! The airport KLM site was closed, and on the phone they told me there is nothing they can do as the flight was already rebooked as the original flight is overbooked and there are no available seats. She did say that there is a small chance he could still get on if there is a cancellation in the moring or a no-show, but I am wondering if it is worth it and what the chances are of him still getting on it.

EDIT 2: When we checked the KLM app just now (2 am), as well as just re-booking my son's flight, they now have also bumped my husband and myself from the seats we paid extra for due to 'operational reasons'. No way to call them at this hour, so we are just going to go to the airport at 3:30 am.

Thanks to everyone that has replied, the information was so useful, even if we can't get it sorted!!

EDIT 3: We all went to the airport at 3 am. Turns out that it was not the flight to Amsterdam that was overbooked, but the flight from Amsterdam to Johannesburg. They had already put my son on a British Airways flight and were not able to change that back, despite 6 available seats on the original flight popping up on the attendants screen 🙄​. We ended up all changing over to BA which means we'll arrive at 7 am tomorrow morning instead of 9 pm tonight. It's  going to be one long-ass trip until we get to our final destination tomorrow at 2 pm, as we all didn't get any sleep last night 😂 but at least we're all together. Here is hoping there won't be any delays for our connecting flight in joburg! 

Compensation wise, only my son will get a voucher or a lesser amount of cash, since we volunteered to change with him. 

I want to add that we had an absolutely fantastic KLM attendant, Katie, who tried her absolute hardest to get all of us on our initial flight. She left no stone unturned. Thank you, we really appreciated all your efforts. I'll be sending in a great review to KLM. 

Also, thanks to everyone on here that helped with advice. We appreciate you! ❤️ ",2025-04-14 19:51:13,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,156,60,,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jz86wp/airline_rebooked_my_sons_ticket_without_permission/,Bushbaby77
1k6hpxr,reddit,Guatemala during April 2025,"Travelled to Guatemala for 2 weeks during Semana Santa.

I was pleasantly suprised with everything that guatemala had to offer. A country where here is a LOT of walking and hiking. There is river tubing, water cave tours, Mayan ruins exploration, boat rides, cultural celeberations. 
Friendly but fairly expensive, I hope to come back to see El Fuego in its full glory someday :)

Tips- Local bus travel is more tedious here, shuttles were modest in price considering the distance.

Street food is great and helpful if you're on a budget. Restaurants specifically in Antigua are overpriced. It felt like paying North American prices at many of the places.

Easter is a bad time if you want peace and relaxation. There were tons of people, even in Semuc Champey. I did not mind that, locals are very friendly. The night time processions of easter where people carry the wooden replicas was intriguing.

You can catch a game of Soccer which would be a great exprience, either in San pedro Laguna or Antigua.


Acatanengo hike is an excruciating experience. I will remember it fondly even though the views were non existent.

In my case, two trips come to mind.

One was to Morocco — I went solo, bought the ticket just two days before, and spent 10 days letting the unknown guide me.

The other was walking the Camino de Santiago with my mother. I’m a 32-year-old man, and something deep shifted along the way.

1jt3zhh,reddit,Scams in Europe (as a European),"Since I really appreciated all the advice and scam warnings about Egypt, I wanted to return the favor and share some common scams and tourist traps you might run into around Europe!

Flower Scams: People (sometimes even kids) will try to hand you a rose as if it’s a gift. Once you accept it, they’ll demand money and refuse to take it back. Best move: just don’t take it in the first place. If you already did, just drop it and walk away.

Bracelet Trick: Similar to the rose scam — someone might tie a bracelet on your wrist and say it’s a gift after you’ve refused, and  then of course still demand payment. Be firm and walk off if this happens.

Restaurants Sneaking in Charges: In tourist-heavy areas, some restaurants will bring out a cheese board or dips without you ordering them. It seems like a free appetizer, but you’ll see it on the bill later. Always ask if it’s complimentary before touching it.

Tourist Trap Red Flags: If there’s a host outside pushy trying to pull people in or rushing you to sit before you can even properly read the menu — probably not the best place to eat.

Transportation Tips: Public transport works really well in most European cities. If you need a ride, go with Uber or Bolt over traditional taxis, which can be overpriced or shady.

Street Performers in Costume: Those dressed up as mascots or characters may offer free photos, especially with kids — but they’ll expect payment afterward. Just say no unless you’re okay tipping them.

Fake Charity Scams (esp. in Paris): Groups (often young women) will approach you with clipboards, asking for donations to a fake charity. Politely decline and keep walking — donate to a legit organization in your own country instead.

Pickpocketing: Thankfully I haven’t been pickpocketed, even after traveling to a bunch of cities where it’s a known issue. I always carry a small crossbody bag with a zipper, worn in front. Fanny packs worn the same way seem like a solid option too.

Photo Scam: Someone may offer to take a “professional” photo of your group, only to later try and sell it to you printed on a plate or souvenir frame. Just use your own phone and pass on this one.

Hope this helps someone out there! Feel free to add your own experiences — always good to know what to look out for.

I went to Colombia last year where pickpocketing is also fairly common so I have some experience protecting myself, and I understand a lot of it just basic common sense (simply not keeping your valuables in visible pockets or in baggy clothes) but I heard that there was a chance it could be worse in Europe so I wanted to hear if there were any greater safety measures we could take. I heard they even unzip bags if you’re not keeping an eye on it. These could also just be exaggerated rumours but I always rather be safe than sorry :) 

My sister also recently fell victim to a pickpocket here at home in Toronto where we thought we were safe! (pickpocketing is rarely brought up as a concern here in comparison to other crimes) So I guess you could say we’ve learned our lesson and are trying to be much more aware now 😅

And I’d like input on my own idea: I’ve thought about attaching the wrist strap of my phone case to a carabiner attached to my pants if I do decide to leave it in my pocket at times—assuming that it’d be much harder to yank my phone out of my pocket if it’s attached to a carabiner lol",2025-04-16 17:15:52,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,105,288,,0.7,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k0pu85/pickpocketing_prevention_in_europe/,pootluv

1jw0ph0,reddit,I had a blast in Egypt 🇪🇬 as a female traveller,"I went to Hurghada with another female friend of mine, instead of staying at hotels or resorts we opted for an Airbnb in a higher end residential apartment complex.

We only ate at restaurants/cafes which had good reviews on Google, ordered from Talabat many times and had zero stomach issues. I avoided drinks with ice in it, and drank so much fresh juice. Ate all kinds of fruit and salads with no issues. Although later i got to know my coffee was made with tap water and i drank that two times a day 😅
I only got ripped off one time, with a vape i brought which was supposed to be 1000 puffs but finished in half a day. It might not be the sellers fault,because he opened the package in front of me. 

Before i brought anything i checked the price on Talabat (which is generally more expensive because its a delivery app) and never paid anything more than the price on the app. 
Used Uber everywhere with card payment,never took local taxis.
Instead of buying a sim card at the airport,i brought one in the city at the Orange store for the same price they listed on their website.

Got 7GB internet package with sim card for 250 egp or something. 
The hustlers didn't bother me much, they are just doing their job,why hate on them? 
Just don't engage, and keep on walking.
At Karnak Temple we got approached by a security guard offering to take our pictures which we didn't want at first but somehow he managed to take my phone and snap a few pictures, well i got a few okay-ish pictures and paid nothing to him,because thats not how it works.

Never spoken to any taxi driver,wait staff or shop keeper outside of the necessity, and definitely didn't smile or joked/laughed with any man. Kept the talking brief and maintained a stone face at all times. Never got harassed.

I just remembered something else, for money exchange i used Revolut to exchange my local currency to EGP and withdrew at an ATM once i reached there. Mostly at Bank of Egypt ATMs. But in Hurghada i could use my card almost everywhere. 

I had a really amazing vacation ❤️

1jrphhc,reddit,The lows of solo travel,"I'm currently on a trip in central america and finding it depressing how hard it's been to meet people/socialize. 

I've traveled since I was about 19, now I'm 31(m) and I've never found it this difficult to integrate into a hostels social scene. I've approached people and started conversations, asked what people are up to or where they're from etc (the usual) but the conversations more often than not just go dead with little to no reciprocal effort.

The last hostel I was at I saw these guys that were on the same shuttle as me when we arrived  so I went and chatted for a bit only for them to walk off as soon as these girls showed up that they seemed to know.

I'm by myself for a couple weeks until my girlfriend arrives and it's been exhausting making these attempts and people just seeming to want to stay in their cliques. I have tried mentioning my girlfriend earlier so that guys don't see me as ""competition"" when there are girls around (kinda pathetic but a lot of guys seem to give the cold shoulder if there are girls around until I do this) and so the women don't think I'm just trying to hook up or something like that.

Maybe it's just luck of the draw, maybe it's younger generations not being as social, maybe I'm just more awkward than I used to be but I feel tired and a bit self conscious.
If I simply don't try to talk to anyone nobody has approached me so far.

When we were at passport control in the ferry terminal at Tangier Ville to go back to Tarifa, my passport, my husband’s and my son’s all were processed normally and stamped.

 When they got to my 15 year old daughter, they spent forever looking at it, looking at her, asking other officials to look at it, gesticulating in a way that suggested confusion. I don’t understand Arabic, unfortunately. After about 10 minutes, they had her stand in front of a camera for a photo, and a few minutes later smiled, said “it’s ok!”, gave a thumbs up, and waved us through.

We were all laughing after because while trying to remain calm we were all panicking internally imagining ourselves in a holding cell being interrogated.

For added context- her passport is 3 years old and her face has undergone normal pubescent changes so she looks older but not THAT different. We travel frequently and her passport had been checked entering and exiting Gibraltar and entering Morocco without so much as a second glance just within a 5 day period. When we reentered Spain an hour later there was no issue.

Many people said winters in Stockholm are miserable, and while I do agree that coming in Summer would have allowed me to visit many more different islands and enjoy the city a hit more, Stockholm and the islands are still totally worth visiting outside the summer months (admittedly the weather in March is not the worst).

I love love love the archipelago surrounding the city. I had the chance to appreciate the outer islands as the cruise from Tallinn approached Stockholm city centre and passed by the archipelago. The islands were almost totally covered by snow, which looked so stunning! After a few days, I took a day trip from Gamla Stan to Vaxholm by ferry. Vaxholm is such a lovely and peaceful place which is very easy to get to. I really enjoy my time there, and would love to explore other islands such as Landsort next time.

Of course, Stockholm itself is a wonderful city with amazing museums, palaces and scenery that captured my heart. The open-air museum Skansen is very interesting, with a zoo that houses many different kinds of animals; Vasa Museum and the Royal Palace where the changing of the guard took place outside are both very impressive. I would say the food is very good too, even though it is expensive (not surprising for a Nordic country).

Hi Everyone.  

Thank you all for the responses  I have read all of them.  I""m sorry for not responding to all of them sooner. I picked up extra hours at work and have been exhausted when I get home.  I really just want to do something different for a vacation.  Something out of the ordinary.  A friend of mine from work recently cross country from New York to California on Amtrack. Stayed in San Franscisco for a couple of days.  Flew down to LA stayed a couple of days and then went LA back to New York on a different train.  He said it was amazing and he had an absolute blast.  I love this idea and was also thinking about taking it a step further and going from Main to either California or Seattle. 

I've been kicking around ideas about maybe even going to Bora Bora.  Joining a travel group and going to Egypt.  The more I read all your responses I don't think driving the Route 66 would be a good idea.  But it was fun to think about for now.

All it shows is a per room rate. When you show up at the hotel like I did, you have the hotel telling you breakfast or dinner wasn’t included and you have to pay extra (AGAIN). The Expedia customer rep can only look at the booking details so if it doesn’t say you paid for an add on, they can’t verify what you’re saying. Even if you show them this is almost 1/3 more than the regular room rate, they can blame it all on “dynamic pricing”. 

This happened to me and I saw someone else on here report the same thing from a few months ago. It’s a known issue that Expedia is seemingly refusing to resolve. So I’m just hoping to warn everyone. Always check the receipt includes your add-on, or just never book with Expedia…

1jwru1j,reddit,"⚠️ BEWARE: Mondee Travel - Lost $3,500, Zero Customer Protection ⚠️","AVOID THIS COMPANY

My experience with Mondee has been nothing short of a nightmare, resulting in a $3,500 loss with zero support or resolution after 9 months of disputes. Here's why you should think twice before using their services:

THE SITUATION:

* Booked Kapari Natural Hotel in Santorini through Mondee (June 2024)
* Arrived to find completely unacceptable conditions (July 31, 2024)
* Had to leave within 2 hours and book alternative accommodation
* Still fighting for a refund 9 months later
* Credit Card Disputes denied because Mondee transferred payment to the hotel.

MAJOR ISSUES:

1. Mondee refuses responsibility despite: • Processing my payment • Listing the property on their platform • Making false representations about the accommodation • Acting as the booking agent
2. Property Conditions (All Documented with Photos): • Extensive mold infestation • Structural damage (holes in walls) • Broken plumbing • 40 undisclosed steps to room (accessibility nightmare) • Unsanitary conditions throughout • Direct view of nudist pool area (not disclosed)
3. Customer Service Failures: • Refused to process refund • Claimed ""no responsibility"" as middle-man • Told me to ""seek refund from hotel"" (whom I never paid directly) • Ignored safety and health concerns • No resolution after multiple disputes

IMPACT:

* Paid twice for accommodation ($3,500 loss)
* Ruined start of family vacation
* Endless hours wasted on disputes
* Significant stress and inconvenience

BOTTOM LINE:  
Mondee operates on a ""not our problem"" business model. They'll take your money, but the moment something goes wrong, they abandon their customers. Their claim of being ""just a middle-man"" is convenient when problems arise, yet they're happy to act as a direct service provider when collecting payment.

WARNING TO OTHER TRAVELERS:  
If you're considering using Mondee, understand that you'll have ZERO protection if things go wrong. They will not stand behind their listings or support their customers. Your money will be at risk with no real recourse.

ADVICE:

* Book directly with hotels or use reputable travel sites with actual customer protection
* Document EVERYTHING if you do use Mondee
* Check other review sites - you'll find similar horror stories
* Save yourself the headache and avoid this company entirely

After 9 months of getting nowhere with their ""customer service,"" I'm sharing this to warn others. Don't make the same $3,500 mistake I did.

I haven't really been out of the tri-state area much, and whenever I've been out of the city it's been on a train or on a car driven by someone else. Given my current circumstances, I neither have the means nor the money to learn how to drive and get a license/car for at least another few years (college student). 

However, I have a free summer and some saved-up money and I want to go travelling across the US, which is something I've never done. I have a couple of landmarks I want to see and some towns I want to visit, mostly on the West Coast, but I don't know how to do this without a car. I've looked into buses but they're slow and inconvenient - especially considering I want to visit friends who live in smaller cities in Washington, Oregon and California and there are almost no direct bus routes between them. I can only really afford one flight (probably a roundtrip to Seattle or LA) but from there I really don't know what to do. 

I've considered maybe going with friends who can drive but everyone I've asked already has summer plans and I prefer travelling alone. That said, I'm also kind of cautious of taking buses at weird hours as a solo traveller. 

Any advice? Am I screwed? Should I wait a few years until I'm in a position where I can get a license? Should I take my saved money and travel somewhere else? I've been wanting to do this kind of trip for a while for sentimental reasons and any helpful tips would be appreciated.

1jrfftx,reddit,Cinque Terra - Aug 2023,"We spent 4 nights in Monterosso in the old town. Cinque terra is one of my favorite places ever.  I visited on a solo trip in 2000 and was able to return in 2023 with my family.

18. Diving off the pier for a swim at Vernazza. If I could close my eyes and magically appear anywhere in the world, it would be there on that day. Hot as hell, decided to cut sightseeing short and swim with my family for a while. The water was perfect, and somewhat salty so it made you very buoyant and easy to float around.   One of the best days I can remember. Just above this is the old fort and Ristorante Belforte where we water after this and which I pictured above.

1juyt6v,reddit,"Need help: Unintentionally overstayed in Vietnam and now being told extension is the only option, which could take weeks to process.","I overstayed my Vietnam e-visa by 22 days due to an honest mistake. I applied for a 90-day visa and stupidly assumed the visa matched the application, but somehow it was only granted for 63 days. I didn’t realise the actual expiry date and accidentally overstayed.

I tried to leave the country, but immigration at the airport denied me boarding and said I had to go to the immigration office. I wasn’t allowed to pay the fine at the airport.

At the HCMC immigration office, they’ve told me I *must* apply for a visa extension, which could take 2 weeks or even longer. (one officer quoted up to two months!) After this happened, I went back with a Vietnamese friend who clearly asked whether I could apply for an *exit visa*, but the officer said this doesn’t exist and that an extension is the only way forward.

From everything I’ve read online, applying for an exit visa (or exit permit) seems like the standard route for overstays under 30 days. I don’t want to stay in Vietnam longer, I just want to leave as soon as possible and pay the fine.

I’ve already filled out the NA5 and supporting documents, but haven’t submitted them yet.

Has anyone been through this recently and can confirm:

* Does the exit visa actually exist and apply in this situation?
* Can I still request it even if the officer says no?
* Is this just a bureaucratic block or is extension genuinely the only way?

Any help or clarity would be appreciated. I'm just looking for the fastest way to leave.",2025-04-09 05:57:53,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,64,23,,0.74,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1juyt6v/need_help_unintentionally_overstayed_in_vietnam/,thesmarteconomy

1jue6j8,reddit,Thoughts on visiting the same country twice in a row?,"I’ve had this discussion a few times with a friend and we have fundamentally different travel philosophy. He believes in never visiting the same country twice until he’s been to them all, he’s been to over 20 countries and says there’s only one he would revisit at this point. 

We went on my first big international trip last year and I mentioned wanting to go back to do all the things we missed plus some of the solo stuff I couldn’t do with him. 

He told me that would be a mistake and if I’m going to travel I should try going somewhere else before repeating the same country. Even if I want to visit again, at least don’t go back to back.

I’d like to open a discussion on this topic and hear all sides. I personally don’t see what’s wrong with what im doing. This would be my first big solo trip, so I figured going to the same country gives me some familiarity while I get used to traveling alone. And it would be a completely different region in that country anyway, with a different language, so it’s not like I’m going back to the same exact place.

Will I regret it? I can only do 1-2 trips like this a year and im getting older so in a way im missing out on some other destination to do this twice.

1k29tfc,reddit,Would you learn a foreign language for the sake of traveling?,"Essentially what the headline says. I'm interested in any thoughts you would like to share on the topic. 

Optionally, I'll give a bit of context for my personal situation. Feel free to skip this. I might not be an interesting read;

Ever since I reached adulthood I have prioritized traveling in my life. Fortunately, I have a husband that shares my passion and even if our traveling styles are somewhat different, we have always been able to make compromises and plan trips that are satisfying for both of us.

My husband would be perfectly content, flying to the US for every vacation, whereas I always want to see something new and visit places and countries that I haven't been to yet.

This means that for the last 10+ years, we have always spent 2 weeks in the US and 2 weeks someplace else. Therefore, I never really saw the point in learning a new language just for traveling, because even if the language would come in handy for one trip, I would probably never need it again.

However, last year I felt inspired to sit down and think about which countries I feel like I absolutely need to have seen in my life and to my surprise there aren't actually that many left. Meaning that in a couple of years I could essentially visit all the remaining countries.

And of course that brought me to the question: Where will we travel to, once we've already seen all that we've wanted to see? – The answer I have arrived at is that we would revisit those places that we enjoyed most the first time around.

With the prospect of possibly revisiting some of these countries again and again over the coming years, I think it might be worth it to learn some of these languages up to at least a low intermediate level.

While it would obviously be a big plus on the one hand to speak some Japanese for example, when we explore some of the less touristy corners of the country, it would also be a big commitment on the other hand, even if I only dedicate a limited amount of time to it.

I'm also a bit ""worried"" that by learning a certain language, I would be more inclined to choose destinations where I can speak that language. That  might feel like I'm limiting myself, I don't know.",2025-04-18 16:58:02,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,59,117,,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k29tfc/would_you_learn_a_foreign_language_for_the_sake/,salian93

Is there any blanket rule depending on the location(like EU, etc) or airlines or is it mostly handled case by case?

1jrxx7h,reddit,"Bus Service from Tissamaharama (Thissa) to Ella, Sri Lanka","I had a difficult time finding accurate and complete information for the bus route from Tissamaharama (Thissa) to Ella in Sri Lanka (bus route 10) online, so I wanted to provide this for future Sri Lanka bus travel planners.

**General Overview**
According the bus station attendant in Thissa, route 10 buses leave at 7am and 8:10am from Thissa to Ella. The full bus route is from Katharagama to Kandy, which is shown on the bus signage along with its route number.

I got on the “7am” bus in Thissa at 7:09am and I got to Ella at 9:58am. This was a 2 hour and 49 minute bus ride.

The bus from Thissa to Ella costs 467 Sri Lankan rupees (about usd$1.58 at the time of this post)

Primary bus stops on Route 10 are: Katharagama, Tissamaharama (Thissa), Thanamalwila, Wellawaya, Bandarawela, Welimada, Nuwaraeliya, Pussellawa, Gampola, Peradeniya, Kandy

A map and downloadable GPS file I collected of the route can be found [here](https://maphub.net/a_common_porpoise/bus-route-10-from-thissa-to-ella)

**Ride Details and How to**
Get onto the bus either from the front door or back, it doesn’t seem to matter. If you are not at a bus station, and only a roadside bus stop and flagging the bus down, be ready for the bus to only slow down and not actually stop, you have to literally jump into the bus before it speeds back up. The buses typically have route numbers (Route 10 in this case) as well as origin and destination names displayed on the front and back of the top of the bus in English. When you get on the bus, *the conductor will come to you*, tell them your destination. You pay in cash, they can typically  provide change. You will receive a paper ticket or receipt for your journey. Reservations are not possible that I know of, just show up and get on. I did not have a problem finding a seat on my buses in Sri Lanka, I never had to stand, however the buses do fill up periodically through the journey so be prepared to be crammed in if necessary.

There is some space for bags/luggage above the seats (overhead), the opening width is approximately 12 to 15 inches (30 to 38cm). On my several bus rides through Sri Lanka there was always space in these overhead spaces, but a large piece of hard-cased luggage could be difficult to find space for.  I believe there is extra storage on the back of the bus for large items, accessed from the outside of the bus, but I never had to utilize this space, so am uncertain how it works. You can also place bags at your feet or under the seat in front of you, and if there is available space, directly on the seat next to you. As a heads up, if there is no seating left on the bus, and you have a bag in the seat next to you, you may be asked to move the bag elsewhere. 

There are no restrooms on the bus, but most bus stations (not bus stops) do have basic restroom facilities, some for a small fee (~20rs) and some free. The buses do stop at some stations for 5 or more minutes, but I am uncertain how to know which ones these are beforehand if you wanted to get out, talking to the conductor would probably provide this information if you needed it. Ideally you don’t have to do this and just stay on the bus to keep your seat and not be left behind.

The buses stop when people wave them down on the side of the road. This means the buses stop and accelerate frequently depending on the route, day, and time of day. Buses can fill up and empty many times on a multi-hour trip.

Seats are in a 2 and 3 person quasi-bench configuration. On the left side of the bus, each bench can hold 2 people. On the right side of the bus, each bench can hold 3 people.

There is no AC on the buses, but windows do open. The windows are glass as well, so when it is raining you still have a view. Some buses elsewhere, like in parts of India, do not have glass windows but only opaque accordion-like blinds, so this is a nice feature in Sri Lanka.

Seats are covered with a vinyl type material and are cushioned. There are armrests on the aisle seat but not between individual seats. Legroom seems to vary between buses, some it is quite tight and others it is sufficient to generous.

Music is typically played at a medium-loud volume during the whole bus ride. Typically fast tempo local music. Personally, I found the music annoying for so many hours given its loud volume, but it is certainly part of the experience.

At larger bus stations vendors come onto the bus to sell edible items. Typically fruits, corn, nuts, and baked goods. There are also sometimes people selling (or requesting donations for) non-tangible items with pamphlets, possibly religious.

Buses do not have internal signage for stops like in the US, Europe, Japan, etc. You will need to keep the GPS on your phone up and running to know when you need to get off. When it’s your time, be ready to jump fast, as they often only slow down for you.

Bus drivers do not appear to care about road rules or safety. They drive incredibly fast, it feels extremely sketchy.

**Getting to Thissa**

The train does not go all the way to Thissa, so you will likely need to take a taxi or bus to get there. If you are somewhere west of Thissa, like Dikwella / Hiriketiya Beach, then taking the 334-1 bus is extremely easy. It comes about every 20 minutes and is in Google Maps. Most of the information above can be applied to that route as well.",2025-04-05 07:19:13,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,43,11,,0.87,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jrxx7h,soil_nerd

Will be leaving next weekend, flying from Toronto (I'm a 39F of it helps, and I've done solo trips before). I'm not spiritual, so I don't mean a yoga retreat or spa, more so a chill environment with good vibes that I can lose myself in.

I'm a writer, so I would love time to focus on some personal work; an environment conducive to sitting in cafes for hours with my laptop. 

Not too quiet, as I prefer a place with some energy and vibrancy and to see people out and about.

 I love train rides, art/history, and nature. 

Don't care much for partying, shopping, or strenuous physical activities.


I typically hop from one city/town to the next, but if I really like a place then I'll stay longer - I don't book hotels/travel in advance so that I can have flexibility to be spontaneous. 

Favorite countries include Ecuador, Switzerland, Laos, France, and Thailand, and I equally enjoy big cities and small towns, and developed/less developed places. On my bucket list are Sri Lanka, Zanzibar, Mongolia, Norway, Guatemala, and further exploration of small towns across France/Italy. But I'm very open and I don't have to pick one of these locations for this trip.

Would really appreciate your advice!

1k1982l,reddit,Missing items from checked-in luggage,"
Hello!

Did anyone ever experience having stuff removed/missing from their checked-in bags? Me and my bf just flew in from Beijing via Bruxelles, to Budapest, and we opened our checked in bags now. I am missing a bottle of Soju, and he is missing a can of beer. It’s not much, I know, but we double and triple checked the limits of how much alcohol we can bring and we were both well under. 

Moreover, my bag had also some snacks that were tempered with, as I found a tape with “B33” over it. 

Is there anything we can do about it? Would we be able to get any compensation? I don’t mind being checked, but since we were under the legal quantities, I don’t think it was the case for this.

1jxvmui,reddit,what do I do if i’m absolutely getting f****d by greyhound? durham to charlotte,"hey, so i honestly don’t know what to do

I booked a ticket to charlotte from durham and bought 2 tickets for 51$ in total. the plan was the get there at 9:15 and get on the bus at 9:35, okay, cool.

I get there early, around 9:05am and wait. around 9:20am, a bus with a completely different bus number and was called “new york - atlanta” pulled up and I was confused if it was mine or not, so I asked two employees and both told me to go ask the driver, I went up to the driver who was offloading luggage’s and he told me no then proceeds to quick turn his back from me and keep offloading?? so Cool i go back inside feeling like a dum*ss and i wait. the bus leaves at 9:37 and a lady comes up to me and says “baby what time is your bus” and i told her 9:35 and she said “that was your bus why didn’t you get on” then flung her hands in the air and walked away while muttering something? i’m unsure why everyone is a f/ing a/hole in this place I was anxious and this is my first time solo traveling so I’m so confused why 1. He lied to me and told me it’s not my bus (and please guys believe me i SHOWED him my ticket and CLEALY said charlotte) and 2. why was the lady being so rude just cus i missed MY bus? 

I contacted greyhound support, they ignored me. Just contacted them via their website, absolute useless. I called them and was slapped in the face with “yeah that’s not our fault but i can give you a $13 voucher but charge you a $35.99 cancelling fee” ??? what the HELL is this bus station? Please, I seriously need advice how to get all my money back because i will NEVER ever use this bus again.

1k3qkuz,reddit,"Trip 2026 – torn between Taiwan, Thailand, South Korea, Malaysia or Nepal – which one would you recommend?","I am based in Europe and I love traveling  – especially when it’s meaningful and a bit off the beaten path.

So far, I’ve been to:  
Portugal,  Italy, Netherlands, Switzerland, France, UK, Luxembourg,China, Japan, Singapore, Sri Lanka  
Dubai

For my **next trip in March/April 2026**, I’ll have about **2–3 weeks**, and I’m currently torn between:

* **Taiwan** – love the idea of nature, food and underrated destinations
* **Thailand** – a classic, but still new for me: street food, culture, islands, temples
* **South Korea** – big on café culture, design, and hiking. Never been!
* **Malaysia** – super diverse and interesting, **but I might want to save it** for a future trip with my mom (maybe combined with Sri Lanka)
* **Nepal** – fascinated by the landscapes and spirituality; curious about beginner-friendly treks and Kathmandu valley

Since I live in Europe, I like to **combine two countries** when flying to Asia – to make the long trip really worth it. I’m not sure when I’ll be ""in the area"" again, so I try to see a bit more when I go.

**My questions:**  
➡️ Which of these countries would feel **most different** from the places I’ve been to so far?

➡️ Any two-country combinations you’d recommend for a 2–3 week itinerary?

*Is there a destination I haven’t considered that might be just as cool for someone like me?* I'd love suggestions I might be overlooking!

Also curious:  
Are there any trips you think are **especially great in your early 30s** – before life changes (family, limited vacation time, rising costs) make them harder to do later?

Just to add some context: I’m more of a quiet and introverted person – I don’t make connections super easily when traveling, and honestly, I’m okay with that. I enjoy moving around, walking, exploring cultural sites, trying new food, or just relaxing with a book in a cozy café. I’m **not much of a beach bum** or **party type**, so I’m usually not looking for nightlife-heavy destinations.

1juxng3,reddit,Bali- South Coast Beaches 🤮,"(a little rant)

Been travelling the past 14 months (huge island person) and have a home base in Bangkok.

I've avoided Bali for a lot of reasons (over hyped , over tourism, reports of pollution and influencer heaven).

A friend wanted to go to Komodo for a few nights, so we decided to stay in Bali a few nights before catching a quick 1 hour flight to lebuan Bajo.  

My expectations were already really low,  but I thought let's make the best of it, catch the epic sunsets, have a few bintangs and try to catch a few waves on the boards.

Bali Southern beaches were disgusting-  canguu to kuta-  the amount of garbage on the beaches and in the water is stomach turning.

In Thailand, beach bar owners would wake up early every morning and rake any plastic/rubbish that hit the shores..  not here in bali-  they don't give a crap at all.   You would think they would take some pride on their beach to ensure they clear out rubbish-   something that small would make a difference.

I just don't get it.   Trying to enjoy a beer at the beach but you are literally surrounded by trash -  how anyone can relax next to a landfill is crazy.      Not sure how anyone can continue to come here or anyone can actually promote it.

Again- I'm talking about the state of the beaches and water ( not the people or culture).

I've always taken reports of Bali with some grain of salt-   but it was worse than I imagined.      Definitely will never come back.   So many  islands here in Indo that deserve $$ and are actually beautiful      ",2025-04-09 04:42:03,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,37,17,,0.79,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1juxng3/bali_south_coast_beaches/,OneLife-No-Do-Overs

Bali seems to be more famous for ""digital nomads"" which will be convenient as I'll do some of my work there but I fear it'd won't be as a unique experience versus Thailand.

However, in the descriptions of every single tour we found, other than some boat cruises, was the stipulation that ""Travelers should have a moderate physical fitness level.""

For folks more experienced with travel in general and guided tours specifically, what level of physical fitness do you think is considered moderate in this context?

For example, my mom goes for 30 minute daily walks and goes to an exercise class about twice a week, but unfortunately she is a somewhat slower than average walker. Do you think this would be a problem, or would she fall within the range of ""moderate""?

She doesn't have any disabilities or mobility challenges other than her below average walking speed, but since we have been unable to find any tours without this stipulation, we're at a loss.

1jn1663,reddit,pictures & info//tips from my trip to the west coast !,"i traveled with my dad, im a teenage girl so my opinions may be different from a middle-aged man ! but im pretty well traveled so id say my opinions are good 🙂‍↕️
ITINERARY (ish) : 
we started in Tacoma, WA, but we only stayed for the night after our flight and didnt stay for anything but Mt. Rainier and Mt. Saint Helens sadly (both so pretty, but i didnt take many pictures), (i wanted to go to the beaches)
then drove down Highway 1, stopping at a bunch of tourist-y locations along the way, stayed the night in Lincoln, Oregon
kept going along Highway 1 (stopping at tourist locations) until we got to Mill Valley, CA, where we stayed until we left for home.

IMAGES : 

first : Agate Beach, OR
SO windy. the wind on the beaches here are insane. it was super pretty, and the beach itself is massive. there were huge dunes that were insanely hard to walk past 😭. we stayed in the hotel right next to it, gorgeous view! very nice hotel too

second : top of Devil’s Punchbowl, OR
soooo huge ! make sure you go when the tide is low so you dont get swamped.

third : in the Devil’s Punchbowl, OR
tons of wildlife to look at, so beautiful, there was a lot of disrespectful people sadly though-definitely a tourist spot. (i also was a tourist so i cant talk lol

fourth : Natural Bridges, OR
the view is nice but theres not much to do related to it, nothing but pictures lol. cant walk up or anything as far as i could tell (though someone was sitting on that arch at one point?? so unsafe looking i dunno how they got there)

fifth : Ape Cave
cold, but not as cold as youd think (but maybe i just got used to it quick cause we were in there for so long). theres two different trails you can do once you go in, an easy and an intermediate, we thought ‘lets not be scaredy cats’ and did the intermediate, be prepared to sweat and CLIMB. there were HUGE rocks, boulders, that you had to hoist yourself ontop of, most are somewhat wet, and there was one point with about a 7’ cliff (up) that had a small rope to use to pull yourself up with. honestly it was really fun though!! first ever cave i had been to and it was actually such a good workout. warning: very dark! you NEED to have a professional(?) grade flashlight (it was required), we got handheld ones but its cause the forehead ones were sold out. definitely wear some thick pants, my dad wore shorts (for some reason??) and it was reaaall uncomfortable

sixth : Tour Thru Tree, CA
thats the specific location but it was near/in the redwood national forest and the trees are soooo beautiful, super tall and even though theyre not the widest, still probably way bigger than what you’d see anywhere else! 

- orgeon is SO gorgeous
- dont take highway 1. i dont know if its worth the views, the roads are windy and really close to a very high cliff, there were a supprising amount of semis and BIG trucks speeding, i dont get car sick and even i felt nauseous driving on it
- stay outside of san francisco, close by the bridge so if you wanna explore the city you can do it without a far drive-IF youre okay with toll prices. we stayed in Mill Valley and it was a cute little town, very walkable
- as a teenage girl, i loved the Asian Mall in SF, so many cute stores, cafes, etc. definitely worth a visit if youre nearby.
- if you travel through SF definitely consider driving or using an uber 😭. through the different ‘towns’ (japantown, german town, etc) it may say its a few miles, but thats gonna be uphill (from most locations you start from) and its really hard to find bathrooms or places to sit. we ubered back to the car.

1jnuih5,reddit,Can't decide where to go - Budapest/Prague OR Istanbul,"Hi, I'm a 22 year old male college student who plans to solo travel to Europe this summer. I've been two Europe twice, once by myself when I was 19 and I went to Rome, and a second time when my roommate and I went to Copenhagen/Stockholm.

I've been eyeing up both Budapest and Istanbul for a while now. Both have great appeals to me, but I just can't decide which one to go to. I plan to go in late May.

If I go to Budapest, I'm going to go to Prague as well - I'll probably even just fly into Prague first since they offer nonstop flights (and i'm scared of connecting flights lol). I also might stop by Bratislava for a day too on the way, probably not Vienna since I don't have too much time, \~10 days total.

I travel solely for historical appeal, cool buildings, historical landmarks, statues, viewpoints of the city, etc. I'm not a partier, I don't drink, club, nor have any social goals. Budapest is of great appeal to me because it seems to have all of what I just mentioned above. Prague similarly, but I'm more interested in Budapest.

Istanbul seems awesome in the same way, tons of historical stuff, but the most appealing part is the culture difference. It'd be the most culturally different place I've ever been to, as I hail from the US. I've always found great interest in the middle east (if you want to consider Turkey as part of it, I see it as a transition zone - and thus a good gateway into it). I've learned the Arabic alphabet and can write it confidently (don't speak much of the language though), and although Turkey primarily uses latin alphabet nowadays, I know it's still present on some signs and stuff and I think it'd be real cool to see it around as well.

Any help deciding which one to go to? Thanks!

Some of my highlights:

* **Swamp tour in the honey island bayou**: absolutely stunning nature, and the closeness to the animals (primarily raccoons due to the season) was amazing. Probably my favourite part of the trip. 
* **Whitney plantation tour**: very interesting to learn more about the life of slaves on a sugar plantation and the history of the region. It added a much needed real and serious touch after the parades.
* **Cooking class at the New Orleans School of Cooking**: we made seafood gumbo, crawfish pie, and banana foster and I will definitely try to implement some of the things I learned at home. It was very fun and tasty. 
* **St. Louis Cemetery No. 1 tour**: very interesting, even if I would have liked to spend time on my own there
* **Parades**: The whole experience of the floats, the marching bands, the throws - it was wild! From a European point of view, the amount of trash was shocking, and the fact that throwing coconuts etc. is permitted baffled me completely. My favourite parade by far was the *Bacchus* parade. All parades were very impressive (we don't have anything near as big where I live), but this one blew me away even more than the others, with the lights and the moving decorations. 
* **Favourite food**: the praline beignets at *Loretta's* (French market) are to die for and I visited the restaurant *Cochon Butcher* three times while there.
* Favourite places in the city: **St. Patrick's church** was more to my liking than St. Louis Cathedral; **Royal street** (French Quarter) for all the little shops and art galleries; **Audubon Aquarium** was a nice alternative for bad weather or as a change to all the sightseeing, as was the **World War II museum** (it's huge, I could have spent two days only here); the **riverwalk** is very nice to just lounge and relax (it was very crowded on Lundi Gras for Zulu's festival though but the fireworks were worth it).",2025-03-26 16:33:58,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,34,1,,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jkg1uc,PositiveBeginning231

He says he can't book me, but says to change the name on the reservation. I look at Priceline that says you can't change a name. But it DID say you could add a name, however saying that you must talk to the hotel in order to add a name.

So I ask him and he says he can't add a name. I suspect he was lying about something as he said I would have to do it on the website (and his demeanor).

So I end up booking a brand new room (again, with my ID). But what's strange is we were able to use my wife's debit card (with her name) no problem.

Anyway, was wondering who I should talk to in order to get my money back. The next morning a separate concierge said the room last night had in fact been 'cancelled' whatever that means.

Who do you think has my money? And is it worth it write an email to them (depending on if it's Priceline or the hotel). Priceline does say no refunds but this is crazy.

1jzpvcc,reddit,Flying with Ryanair for the first time,"Hello,

We’ll travel to Tuscany in September, fyling from Bucharest, Romania to Bologna/ Pisa (depending on prices).

At the moment, Ryanair seems to be the best option, having the best flying hours, and prices.
However, I can see that most people complain about them, having bad experiences while using their services.

My questions are these:

-As long as we respect Ryanair’s luggage policy, is there anything else to worry about?
-When purchasing their tickets, I can see an Insurance plus, available, covering medical, and some cancellation fees.
Is this Insurance plus worth paying for it, adding up to only 40€ in total, for the entire 12 days trip?
-Should we switch to Wizz air, although the arrival is later in the afternoon, and the departure earlier during the day, shortening the trip by a few hours?

Thank you!

1jmth0g,reddit,My assorted tips after a (mostly) self-guided trip to Egypt,"Hello.

I had a trip to Egypt over Christmas/New Years that I mostly did self-guided. Although Egypt is a very popular tourist destination, many people just organise a guided or all inclusive tour. I self-arranged my trip and so thought I would share some general tips for those who are thinking to do the same. 

I’m by no means an expert on Egypt, but hopefully sharing my experience can help others. 

For context, I visited Cairo, Aswan and Luxor over about 12 days. I am a (non-Egyptian) Arabic speaker and visited with my non-Arabic speaking wife, but I don’t believe speaking Arabic is necessary for self-serving Egypt. Our preferred travel standard for an average trip is one step “above” backpacking, with private rooms in basic hotels, public transport and basic/local restaurants.

Where I refer to prices here, assume I paid EGP (Egyptian Pounds) unless I mention otherwise, although I'll mostly quote prices here in USD. Egypt has had bad inflation and currency devaluation, so online prices in EGP go out of date very quickly, whereas their foreign currency equivalent is more stable. 

And apologies in advance, this post turned out way longer than I expected...

# Airport and Visa on Arrival

If you’re eligible for a Visa on Arrival, getting one is painless and generally the recommended way compared to getting an evisa online - many people report the Egyptian evisa website to be very janky.

It costs 25 USD and I paid in USD cash at Cairo International Airport. I paid with a 100 USD note for 2 visas and got 50 a USD note back (I read online that you get your change back in EGP but that wasn’t my experience). Although I have not tried it, I have read you can also pay in EUR and GBP, and that some of the desks accept credit cards. The VOA is a bit funny in that you buy a physical visa slip from one of a few bank desks at the airport and then take the slip and your passport to the immigration desk. You can find more detailed guides online about this if you’re worried, but it’s not hard when you’re there. 

Incidentally, Cairo airport was totally fine on both the way in and out, I think it’s been cleaned up a bit compared to reports I’ve read online. 

To get from the hotel We arranged a driver from our hotel for $20 which is significantly more expensive than taking an uber, but our flight arrived at night (like 11PM) and so we wanted to be secure. For reference, an uber back from downtown cost around $4.

We picked up a Vodafone sim card at arrivals because we read online that they had good coverage all over the country, there are also Orange and Etisalat booths next to it which probably are fine also. 

# Cash

Cards can be used surprisingly widely in Egypt, but you will definitely need cash as well throughout your trip.

ATMs are literally everywhere - it’s the most ATMed country I’ve ever been to - which is handy as their highest note is only 200 EGP (worth around 4USD at time of writing). Every bank ATM I used was totally free, including for foreign cards. This next advice is not specific to Egypt, but make sure you bring a card that won’t charge you foreign exchange fees for use overseas, and decline any Dynamic Currency Conversion offered by any card terminals or ATMs (Google it if you don’t know what DCC is). I did encounter a higher than average number of out of order ATMs but due to how many ATMs there are everywhere this wasn’t a huge deal. 

Touristy places and larger purchases will probably accept foreign currency too, for instance I was short in EGP for paying for breakfast at a guesthouse, but they were happy to accept GBP for it. Apparently hotels in Egypt are required to charge you in foreign currency for your stay, but I don’t think this is universally followed. I prepaid most of my hotels online, although there was one where I paid cash on arrival. I paid that hotel in USD but they were happy to accept basically anything, including EGP. 

Basically all tourist attractions (temples, museums etc) accept card only. Prices can be found on the Egypt Monuments website https://egymonuments.com/. You can technically buy tickets online to most attractions but ticket lines were never really an issue so we never bothered. 

Getting smaller notes can be a hassle sometimes, e.g. a shop might not have enough change for a bottle of water, so break larger notes where you can.

# Transport in town

**Cairo**

In Cairo, you can use Uber to get around easily and without hassle. You can pay by cash or card but I always used the “pay with cash” option because I read stories online of drivers accepting card trips and then demanding cash anyway, but I had zero troubles with any Uber drivers. All took me where I wanted to go and all charged the amount in the app. Uber is ridiculously cheap and I always gave a cash tip on top as well, although I don’t believe this is expected based on some of the (very positive) responses drivers gave when I would tip them (And I’m talking things like rounding a $1.60 trip up to $2). I also read online people recommending Uber Comfort compared to Uber X to avoid bad drivers but honestly I didn’t notice any difference in service and had no troubles - I used both. With Uber X you might get a dirtier car or a car without seatbelts but all drivers I used were honest with me. 

Cairo also has a metro which is actually quite good, but does not go many places tourists would want to go. You can take it if you visit Coptic Cairo though, which we did. There are plans to expand the network deeper into Giza and towards the airport so maybe in the future tourists will use it more. 

I never hailed a taxi in the traditional way, but outside of tourist attractions you can always find taxis quoting overinflated prices like anywhere in the world. That being said, if you don’t feel like waiting for an Uber after leaving a museum etc, you can use the price of an Uber to negotiate a taxi down to something reasonable. E.g. leaving the Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza I was looking to get back to downtown Cairo. Uber quoted around $3-4. The taxis outside originally asked for $15. Walking away, I told them simply that I was intending to call an Uber and how much Uber was charging, and that they could have my business and save me waiting if they wanted to charge me the same as Uber. I ended up taking a taxi for $4.

**Aswan & Luxor**

In Aswan and Luxor, there is no Uber but I used an app called In Drive which works similar, except that you put your trip in and a bunch of drivers will “bid” for your trip. You can then choose which offer to take based on the price, the driver’s star rating and how far away the driver is. Similar to Uber, I had no trouble with any drivers in In Drive. This app is cash only. 

# Transport outside of town

**Drivers**

I arranged two private drivers for trips that weren’t feasible for us to do alone:

* Driver 1: Day tour from Cairo to Saqqarah, Dahshur and Memphis (quoted $50 but I paid in EGP)
* Driver 2: 4 days of drives around Luxor and Aswan (total $300 - paid in USD per the driver’s request). This was:
   * A day tour from Aswan to Abu Simbel, return
   * Transport between Aswan and Luxor one way, stopping at 3 temples on the way (Kom Ombo, Edfu, Esna)
   * A tour around Luxor’s West Bank, including a guide
   * A day tour from Luxor to Dendara and Abydos with a guide

This is where you can save a lot of money compared to what you can get online through your hotel. On the Egypt Tripadvisor Forums, there is a huge thread where people share the details of drivers and their experiences with them. People share what itineraries they did, how much they paid and the driver’s Whatsapp numbers. You can reach out to the drivers directly over Whatsapp to get some quotes. The thread is here: [https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g294200-i9124-k13746126-Drivers\_Guides\_Agency\_Recommendations\_Here-Egypt.html](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowTopic-g294200-i9124-k13746126-Drivers_Guides_Agency_Recommendations_Here-Egypt.html) I recommend sorting the posts by newest and ignore posts from people with 1 comment giving glowing reviews on a driver, as those are probably fake reviews. It’s a bit more leg work compared to just booking something online or through your hotel but you will save hundreds doing this rather than booking online or through your hotel. The driver can also arrange guides for you. You do need to be clear however about what you want to visit to make sure that both you and the driver have the same expectations, so it's not necessarily as straightforward as booking a tour. 

Our Cairo to Saqqarah driver was incredible, and treated us very well, he even brought us biscuits, mandarins and tea and coffee in the car. We decided to skip Memphis because my wife was feeling a bit unwell (just fatigue) which meant we ended up coming back maybe 2 hours earlier than expected, and he wanted to charge us less than originally agreed, but I still paid him the full amount.

Luxor/Aswan was a combination of our driver who we arranged with and some contacts/colleagues of his for Abu Simbel and for the Luxor Day Trip. While he was a lovely guy, he was a bit disorganised and the Tripadvisor fame is clearly giving him more work than he was able to handle.

**Bus and Train**

I also booked 1 overnight train and 1 overnight bus. 

From Cairo to Aswan, we took the sleeper train (https://abelatrains.com/). Frankly, this is a rip off. We paid $115 each for two people in a private sleeper car. You pay Swiss prices but get Egyptian standards. That being said, flying is a hassle and we did get a decent night sleep compared the bus we'd later take, so I would *sort of* recommend it if you are aware that the train is old and rickety and the food isn’t very good (but just have dinner first before you go, it’s not like food is expensive in Cairo). The staff were nice though. Note that the train now leaves from Bashtil station - a brand new and extremely posh-looking train station rather than the old Ramses station you might still find mentioned online. Inside was quite disorganised without good signage. Multiple people gave us wrong information unsolicited (including a police officer) until we finally asked the ticket office, so I strongly recommend thanking but ignoring police officers and “helpful” locals telling you where your train is, and just ask the ticket office. Nobody was asking for tips either, they were just being helpfully unhelpful? 

From Luxor back to Cairo, we took an overnight Go-Bus https://go-bus.com. The cost here was far more reasonable (something like $20 for a 12 or so hour bus) and the standard is comparable to a coach service you might ride anywhere in the world (Flixbus etc). We booked a “business class” bus - which basically gives you a bigger seat with good recline compared to economy and is still reasonably priced. The trip would have been more comfortable but we were seated in the front and top row of a double decker bus, which meant our leg room was significantly reduced, and the front window was right in front of us so there was lots of bright light coming in from outside. The bus would have been far more comfortable in any other row but that was just our luck. Again, I would sort of recommend it, but have the right expectations. If you have the time, doing it by day could be interesting.

# Attractions, Temples etc

So the temples and monuments are main the reason we all go to Egypt, and honestly they are bloody incredible. Only in Luxor did I find the crowds too much, elsewhere it was totally fine. I won’t list everything we did as there are plenty of guides to these online, but here are a few comments especially about logistics:

**Attractions from Cairo**

**Pyramids**: We just went there by Uber and got around the complex on foot where you can basically go wherever you want. Read up on what to look out for before you go (just google for scams etc.) and you’ll be fine. Inside without a vehicle is a fair bit of walking but you can quite easily get to the panoramic points on foot, there’s a road with a footpath running through the entire site. We went in winter so the walking was fine, but in summer I’d probably want a driver in there with me too as you are just wandering through the desert. We went quite early (I think we got there at 8AM and left maybe 11ish) and it was much busier when we were leaving than when we entered. We chose not to buy the supplementary admission tickets to go inside the pyramids as we saw online that it’s very claustrophobic and without anything to see inside, particularly with other tourists there. If you don’t feel like wandering on foot, you can arrange a tripadvisor driver to come in with you, or I’m sure any Uber would be happy to do it for the right price.

**Saqqarah and Dahshur:** Saqqarah is an awesome site and is worth the visit, an easy day trip from Cairo. Some people combine it with the Pyramids of Giza in one day, which would be achievable with a driver or on a tour. We combined it with Dahshur which are more pyramids further away, and are very quiet. Both of these sites have pyramids you can go inside without the cram and crowds of the Giza pyramids. 

**Islamic Cairo** is easy to get to by Uber and a nice place to walk around, especially by evening where it gets lively.

**Coptic Cairo** is also worth going to if you have the time and you can get to by metro. There are some churches there that claim to have bits of floor where the holy family walked, stayed, drank etc (i.e. Jesus and his folks) so if you are religious (or even not) it is interesting experience.

**Cairo Museums**

Cairo has a bunch of archaeology museums these days which makes it a bit hard to decide which to go to. We went to multiple because my wife is big on archaeology, but for normies you don’t need to do that. 

The **Egyptian Museum** is the old one in Downtown Cairo. It’s full of things to see in a British-era heritage building. As a museum, it does have some big ticket items (King Tut’s mask etc) but is less organised, hotter etc. 

The **Grand Egyptian Museum** is the new one out in Giza. As a museum, it’s much more modern and does have plenty to see but it is more expensive, further away, and doesn’t have the most famous items (yet, I think the idea is to move them there eventually). 

Finally there is the **Museum of Egyptian Civilisation**, this is entirely skippable BUT it does have the mummies of the pharaohs, so if you really need to see the corpses of the various Ramses…es you can go here but otherwise I wouldn’t bother. 

Overall, I’d probably lean towards recommending the new GEM if you were going to pick one, unless you are really interested in any particular pieces, but either the GEM or EM would be ok to visit. As an aside, we walked to the EM from our downtown hotel, whereas we combined the GEM with our trip to the pyramids since both are in Giza (but this turned out to be a huge, tiring day, so I don’t know if it was the right approach). The GEM does have a good non tourist trap food court though, so it made for a great lunch stop after the pyramids too. 

**Attractions from Aswan & Luxor:**

**Abu Simbel**: a day trip from Aswan, this site is incredible and was worth the 3 hours drive each way from Aswan. We went with a driver we arranged per my previous section and honestly is probably the best way to get there. The day was from about 8am-4pm, with 2 hours at the site. 

**Phillae Temple**: A temple on an island accessible from Aswan. I wasn’t sure on how to get here from Aswan without arranging with a tour initially but you can order an In Drive from Aswan easily. After the ticket gate you then have to pay for an inflated-priced boat to the island, not included in the admission ticket. Once outside the site I negotiated with a dodgy taxi driver in a 50 year old car to get back to town, based on the In Drive price I was presented, but I’m quite sure I would have been able to call an In Drive back (and I’d probably recommend that too). 

**Esna Temple**: I call this one out specifically because it’s a less visited temple between Aswan and Luxor we stopped at. It’s a small site but the colours are being restored so it’s super vibrant and beautiful. Strong recommend. 

**Karnak Temple**: A huge site in Luxor, but you can easily get here and back by In Drive. Busy, like everything in Luxor, but it’s huge so you’re not too stifled. 

**Luxor Temple**: Honestly you can see everything from outside so maybe don't bother with a ticket and just walk around the perimeter. Do it at night too where it has nice lighting.

**Dendara and Abydos**. Again these temples are less visited (especially Abydos) but are also awesome, although the two are similar to each other. It’s a long day getting here from Luxor and back, but it was probably our favourite day of templeing in Egypt. 

**Valley of the Kings**: Only call out I want to make here is that you can get extra tickets on top of the normal entry to get into a few more restricted tombs. Some are super expensive but there is one extra ticket we added for the tomb of one of the Ramseses (maybe III?) which was super incredible and worthwhile due to having far less crowds and extremely vivid colours.

# Other points on each city

As mentioned, we stayed in Luxor, Aswan and Cairo. 

In **Cairo**, we stayed at an inexpensive downtown hotel (Hola Hotel, Cairo) which was perfectly fine. I quite recommend staying downtown as there are plenty of restaurants etc around, it’s full of locals rather than tourists so you’re not really so hassled on the street. Getting to Islamic Cairo is very close by Uber (we actually walked all the way there and then Ubered back), and there’s a lot of activity downtown too. Obviously Giza is further but 30 minutes in an Uber isn’t that bad. 

In **Luxor**, we chose to stay on the East Bank, which is the more built up side. Again we stayed in a budget hotel (Nefertiti Hotel) which was also fine. I liked the East Bank because you can easily walk to plenty of restaurants, the markets, or the train or bus station. Luxor is both more and less pleasant than Cairo to walk around in, depending on your demeanour. The roads are less chaotic and it’s definitely prettier, with the wonderful walk down the Nile, but you will be getting approached every minute with something, taxi, shoe shining, souvenirs, some guy saying “I work in your hotel” (he doesn’t) etc. Nothing too pushy but it could be frustrating if you are annoyed by touts. 

In **Aswan**, we stayed on Elephantine Island in a guesthouse. This was awesome and a beautiful change of pace from elsewhere we visited in Egypt. Elephantine Island is mostly a Nubian village on an island off Aswan. Unlike other places where you might deal with touts selling stuff, here you’ll deal with children saying hello, chickens, goats and dirt paths, plus a perplexing number of Jamaican themed cafes and restaurants. There’s also a fancy Mariott hotel which is totally fenced off from the rest of the island, which we learned when we trudged through the jungle trying to use the ATM in their lobby. 

There are two local ferries that go back and forth from Elephantine to the mainland all day for very cheap (10 EGp/$0.20 when we went). The two locations on the mainland are here [https://maps.app.goo.gl/8cLhgxsjBPta1Zay8](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8cLhgxsjBPta1Zay8) and here [https://maps.app.goo.gl/cALhZJrjG5heRjnd9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cALhZJrjG5heRjnd9) One thing to look out for is as you’re walking along the Nile literally every boat guy claims he’s the ferry, so if someone is offering you help, they’re more likely trying to get you on their private boat. The boats are well used by locals so if the boat you’re looking at only has tourists on it it’s probably not the one. 

# Costs

Most things in Egypt we found to be quite inexpensive by western standards.

For basic but clean **hotels**, with included breakfast, we paid like $30-40 a night. I’m sure cheaper options can be found, and you can also pay western prices if you want western brands, but this is the sort of price range we stayed. 

**Food** was quite inexpensive too but like all things it depends. We found food cheapest in Cairo because it was the least touristy. There were some meals we had for literally $1 (koshary) or $2 (shawarma). In restaurants we were still only paying maybe $5-10 each for a decent meal. 

The price of **attractions** for foreigners are similar to what you might pay in Europe etc, but because you find yourself going into many temples, it does add up to more than you might expect. Some examples: going to the pyramids (but not going inside a pyramid) - $13, Luxor Temple $10, the (old) Egyptian Museum $10, the (new) Grand Egyptian Museum $25. Locals and those with an ID card from an Arab country pay far less.

**Transport** was inexpensive other than the overnight sleeper train, see the earlier section. 

And finally the big one people always talk about is **tipping**. I'm no expert and don't come from a tipping country but here is how I handled things:

* Firstly, a general rule everywhere when you travel, anybody that approaches you unsolicited (i.e. not you approaching them) is usually trying to get paid. If you already know this, then you’ll quickly identify that if someone starts showing you around somewhere you didn’t ask or offers to take your photo is looking for tips. As such, you can very easily just say “no thank you” when they start offering their service and you will not feel obligated to give money to people that you’re not wanting to give money to. As such, we didn’t find this a problem, and people leave you alone if they can see you're not interested (and thus aren't going to pay anything).  
* At restaurants, I tipped around 10%. 
* In Ubers, I just rounded the ride up (literally less than a dollar). 
* I gave a tip to the private drivers and the guides we had for those excursions (talking about $5-10 for whole day, although there was one amazing guide we had for one day that we deliberately over-tipped).
* Public toilets (other than in restaurants) have an informal fee which is basically a tip for the attendant who hands out toilet paper and cleans the bathroom. I generally gave them the equivalent of $0.20 to $0.50. 
* Hotel housekeeping I really only felt a need to tip at one place where the housekeeper cleaned the room every day and was a friendly face around the hotel. We paid him $4 directly on the way out. 
* And one general thing. If you tip people, unless you’re tipping a larger amount for someone that’s been with you for a few days, tip in EGP and not in $1 bills or foreign coins. Locals can’t exchange $1 bills and coins so then they have to look for tourists from that country that are willing to exchange for them. So if you see an Egyptian at a tourist site with a wad of dollar bills or a handful of Euro coins saying “change change”, they’re not begging or running some sort of scam, they’re just trying to exchange the money they have for something that they can use. So while I’m sure people won’t say no to your dollar bill, be aware that you’re giving them (and other tourists) more hassle by tipping in this way. 

All in all, Egypt self-guided is not for travel beginners, but is not uniquely difficult. With decent pre-planning and research (not just this post!) IMO it’s perfectly fine to do it yourself. People were friendly, we found it safe and the prices to be reasonable.

Feel free to ask any other logistics type questions, although I may not know the answer. Honestly though the tripadvisor forums on Egypt are a great resource for questions and general reading on self guided travel around Egypt. ",2025-03-29 18:58:43,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,27,11,,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jmth0g/my_assorted_tips_after_a_mostly_selfguided_trip/,funfwf

1k1t67z,reddit,My Personal Tips for an Amazing Trip to Bali,"Just got back from a few weeks in Bali and honestly, it was one of the most unforgettable trips I’ve ever taken. If you’re planning to go, here are a few things I learned that might make your trip smoother (and way more fun!):



**1. Respect the Culture**

One of the first things I noticed in Bali is how spiritually rich and respectful the culture is. If you’re visiting temples, bring or borrow a sarong and sash (most temples have them at the entrance). People are incredibly welcoming when you show even a bit of effort.

**2. A Few Words Go a Long Way**

Learning simple phrases like “Terima kasih” (thank you) and “Permisi” (excuse me) made every local interaction feel more genuine. Locals really appreciate it.

**3. Gojek and Grab Are Lifesavers**

These apps were game changers. I used Grab to get around Ubud and Canggu, and Gojek for food delivery after long beach days. Prices are super reasonable too.

**4. Always Keep Cash**

Even though I used my card at cafes and beach clubs, I needed cash for markets, scooters, and small restaurants. I’d suggest exchanging a little at the airport and topping up at local money changers (look for the legit ones).

**5. Sort Out an eSIM Before You Land**

Seriously, this saved me so much hassle. You can use any eSIM like Airalo & Holafly. But, personally I used Jetpac and activated it right before my flight. It worked instantly when I landed and I can used it as a hotspot too. Their plans quite affordable than the kiosk at the airport. Highly recommend setting this up before you go.

**6. Scooter Adventures (and Caution!)**

I rented a scooter for a few days, such a fun way to explore. But Bali traffic can be intense, especially in Seminyak. Definitely wear a helmet and don’t rush it if you’re not confident.

**7. Off the Beaten Path**

While the usual spots like Uluwatu and Kuta were cool, my favorite part of the trip was exploring Sidemen and Amed. Way quieter, and the landscapes were just stunning.

Absolutely ridiculous. The person on the callcenter basically doesn't know why but says he cannot do anything about it as he doesn't have access to the price I am seeing.

1k0h5gk,reddit,"Kids booked under mom's flight reservation, but now flying with dad – will this be an issue?","Hoping someone has experience with this. We booked international flights for our family (Rome to the US), but due to changing plans, Mom can no longer take the same flight. The kids were originally booked with Mom under one reservation/confirmation number, and Dad has a separate reservation number for the same flight.

Now, Dad will be traveling with the kids on that flight. Since the kids' tickets are technically under the mom's reservation (even though they're confirmed and paid for), will there be any issues at check-in or boarding since Mom won’t be flying?

Do we need to call the airline to split the reservation or link Dad’s info somehow? Or will it be fine as long as the kids are accompanied by a parent and have valid tickets?

Appreciate any advice or insight, especially from anyone who's dealt with international flights and traveling with kids under different bookings. Just want to avoid any last-minute airport surprises.

Thanks in advance!

  
UPDATE: I called the airline and they gave me 2 options to sort it out.

1 - I asked them if merging the reservations is possible and they mentioned merging the reservations would not be possible. However what they could do is do a name change and switch the passengers so that they change mom's name to dad's on the ticket with the kids then on dad's ticket, they will change it to mom's.

2 - They could split mom form her reservation with the kids so that the kids have their own reservation, mom has her own and dad has his own. They are unable to merge dad's with the kids', they will create what they call a Travel -together which lets the airport staff aware that passengers are traveling together.

I guess, I will go with option2 and travel with kids birth certificates.  Thank you every for the helpful comments.",2025-04-16 10:31:25,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,23,29,,0.68,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k0h5gk/kids_booked_under_moms_flight_reservation_but_now/,egonakamura

1jm0ouv,reddit,Turkish Airlines' Refund Process: A Masterclass in Bureaucratic Nonsense,"So, here’s my story. I booked a flight from Pakistan to the Bahamas with Turkish Airlines, paid in cash, and—surprise, surprise—the flight got canceled. Fine, things happen. I was then asked to book another flight. The next available one i booked was a month later and happened to be $400 cheaper. I was assured that I would be reimbursed for the difference if I took that flight.

Fast forward—I took the flight, I’m in the Bahamas, and my refund? Nowhere to be seen. After countless follow-ups, sending my brother multiple times to the Turkish Airlines office in Islamabad, and submitting refund requests online, I finally got a response. And what a response it was! Instead of addressing my query, they sent me a generic email stating that my ticket has already been used. Thank you, Turkish Airlines, for that groundbreaking insight.

But here’s where it gets truly ridiculous—apparently, to get my own money back, I need to travel to **Panama** because the nearest office of TK is in Panama. Yes, you read that right. Turkish Airlines thinks it makes perfect sense for me to book another international flight, spend hundreds of dollars, and go through immigration just to claim a refund they owe me. Oh, and it's not like I can send someone on my behalf—no, no, this refund is apparently a sacred artifact that only I, personally, am worthy of retrieving.

At this point, I’m not even mad about the Panama thing (okay, I am), but all I’m asking is to simply **use my $400 credit for my next flight next month**. Is that really so difficult? If Turkish Airlines can reroute flights across the globe, surely they can manage to apply a credit to a future booking.

Has anyone else experienced this level of absurdity with Turkish Airlines? Any advice on how to deal with this? Because at this point, I feel like I need a **visa sponsorship from Panama just to get my refund.**

I picked up my suitcase from the carousel and noticed there was a weird, kind of a comically yellow padlock on it!

1jt5x3x,reddit,Sabbatical suggestions for adventurous destinations far from the East Coast US,"If you're an American who browses here, you already know that our meager PTO combined with the size of our country makes it hard to venture to the other side of the world. That's why I'm planning to quit my job and take a 4-6 month sabbatical (probably not this year). The idea is to embrace the adventures I've been putting off for ""one day when I have the time"". To not give a shit that takes 2 full days to reach the destination and another 2 days to get home. 

I want to take 2 trips during my sabbatical, and I have already decided on **Indonesia** for the first one. I am looking for a second destination and am curious where you would go in this scenario.

**Criteria:**

1. Probably Asia, Africa, or Oceania - these are pretty far from the eastern US and the goal is to take advantage of actually having time for once. Europe, Latin America, and the Carribbean are easily doable while employed lol

2. Not Indonesia - I've already decided this will be the first of my 2 sabbatical trips.  Even though it's not cost effective, I will go home in between and will NOT be traveling from Indonesia to the 2nd destination

3. Vibrant local culture - I'm open to both touristy and off-the-beaten path places, but I'd like to avoid resorts and towns that revolve around resorts. I'm more interested in local culture than relaxation, even if there is a lot of tourism there. I am a tourist, after all. 

4. Access to beautiful nature and outdoor adventures - one of the goals of this trip is challenge myself physically. I'm no Olympic athlete but I can handle most outdoor activities. 

5. Ancient historical sites - old ruins, temples, etc are just an area of fascination for me

6. Budget - not a huge concern 

7. Length of Stay 4-5 weeks. I am an active traveler and definitely prefer bouncing around to different areas over slow travel. 

**Some Ideas I Have, But Would Love Your Opinion**

1. Sri Lanka 

2. Southern India (Goa, Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu)

3. Ethiopia 

4. Tasmania/New Zealand

5. Cape Verde

1jq95n2,reddit,Agoda does NOT help you if you are scammed,"TL;DR:   
They will side with the scammer and keep your money, even if you have proof of not being able to get in touch with the host.

I booked an apartment in Kuala Lumpur through Agoda. There was no communication from the host prior to check in, so I sent them a message on the platform, an email and called them. No response. So I called Agoda, and they claimed they were able to get in touch with the host. They left my number with the host so they could call me. I sent the host another message on the platform, called multiple times (easily 20), and no-one picked up.

I went to the address, and to my horror there were two other groups experiencing the exact same thing, with [booking.com](http://booking.com) and Agoda. They were also not able to get in touch with their host. 

I called Agoda again, and they kept insisting that the host was ""honoring the booking"" and they could do nothing. 

I end up getting a hotel for the night. The next day Agoda informs me over email that I was marked as a ""no-show"", and that the will keep the entire payment. I called again, and sent them proof of me trying to get in touch with the host, including screen shots of call log, the email I sent them and photos from outside the building.   
I was shocked when they told me that it was up to the host to refund me. In my eyes this is clearly a scam, but Agoda would do nothing to help.   
Obviously the host refused the refund, and now Agoda is saying there is nothing they can do. 

What a nightmare situation, I can't believe they just take the word of the host like that. ",2025-04-03 04:21:06,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,16,29,,0.68,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jq95n2/agoda_does_not_help_you_if_you_are_scammed/,pplazer
1jn7zw1,reddit,Should we go to Patagonia or Galapagos?,"My partner and I are from Australia and are travelling to South America for the first time this November. 

Machu Picchu is on both our bucket lists (we are hiking the Inca trail) so we’re definitely spending some time in Peru. The plan from there was to always go to Galapagos as I’ve wanted to go since a friend raved about it, however this week Patagonia came up too. 

I know Peru to Galapagos is a bit of an easier itinerary.

I love the idea of both but can’t make up my mind. Realistically this will be our last trip before we have kids, and I don’t think either are achievable with kids. I want to explore, see as much wildlife as we can. We’re both both beach and mountain people, we love to get outside. 

What will still be around in 15-20 years? I keep thinking this is our only chance to get to either which isn’t true. 

What would you do when you’re still young and child free? 

ETA: We are a little hesitant on Galapagos for logistical reasons as my partner doesn’t t like boats and the boat tour option is pricey, but I think we could stay on the islands  easily. 

We are looking to spend around 3 weeks to 3.5 weeks in total

1jofmd7,reddit,Traveling to India first time in 10 years. Thoughts,"Hi Everyone! 

I just wanted to come on here and give my thoughts of visiting India as an Indian American after not visiting in 10 years. 

I enjoyed India in two ways as a foreign tourist (Agra) and as a somewhat local (with family in karnataka) 

I primarily stayed in Bengaluru with my family and did a few trips to Coorg, Mysore, and Agra. 

First Did a roadtrip from Bangalore to coorg and mysore and I just want to get started by saying if you haven’t heard of coorg UR MISSING OUT, will forever be my favorite place on earth, lush tropical evergreen forests with huge biodiversity. It’s my second time going to coorg (and mysore) and it’s still as amazing as I remember. Mysore was cool too  

It was also my first time visiting North India. Seeing the Taj Mahal has been on my bucket list since forever and seeing it in person was surreal.   
Left the hotel at 5:45 am and our guide took us to the eastern gate and dropped us 1 km away from it. When I got to the gate there was already a 500 queue 😭, was originally planning to be at the gate 5:30 am but unfortunately could not find my eticket on my phone so took like an hr to find it. Nevertheless still was able to get some solo shots with the Taj and saw the beautiful sunrise. Also it most likely not gonna beat the line so don’t be saddened when you get there and there are already a bunch of people ahead of you. 

Now just differences I saw between the north and south: 
Visiting North India vs South India is like two different countries, The south is very laid back in comparison and felt a lot more homey (makes sense tho since my family is from the south). And the north was very busy and overwhelming. 

I think if you wanna visit India please do proper research and figure out which state would best align to what you want to see in India. I honestly think that each state in India is like hoping countries in Europe. Also please don’t generalize India since it’s more diverse than Europe, what you see on the internet is not what India is like all over. 

I honestly think that every state in South India is a must visit (not biased)
For north India I cannot tell you since I’ve only been to one city and it’s not my place to talk about if I barely know how visiting the rest is. People have also told me Agra is known to be a lot dirtier in general compared to most Indian cities so like my experience there would not match other cities in North India. 

I do plan on going to more cities in the north including, Delhi, Jaipur, Chandigarh, varanasi, udaipur and more.

Also as you can see I’m really bad with words so I could’ve probably explained all of this in a more coherently descriptive way but I forgot what I was gonna type halfway through 😍.

We are a family of 4 (2 kids, 11 and 14). Planing on spending 17 nights in Southern Spain. Leaving around July 10 from Toronto. Please guide me on how many nights I should be spending in the following cities. 

So far we thought of spending:

- 3 nights in Seville
- 3 nights in either Ronda or Malaga
- 2 nights in Granada
- 2 nights in Cordoba
- 3 nights in Madrid (maybe a day trip to toledo)
- 4 nights in Barcelona

We are open to changing our iteniary. Thinking of landing in Seville and renting a car. Dropping it in Cordoba and then taking train to Madrid and finally to Barcelona? Also, would you recommend staying in a central location like Malaga and do day trips to nearby cities (less hotel hopping)?

We are interested in beautiful scenery, unique/picturesque towns, some beach activity (not a lot though), and moorish architecture. Not interested in big museums or art galleries.

1jox5ek,reddit,Inner Mongolia?,"Hi, I'm a recent graduate from the UK and am going to Inner Mongolia in September with my boyfriend (who is from Hong Kong, and also speaks Mandarin).

I don't know *anyone* who has been anywhere north of Beijing, so am pretty stuck on how to do things. I am a photographer and have been given a grant from my university for a photo project on the traditional culture of Inner Mongolia - it's specified that this has to be in China, rather than the country Mongolia.

Plans so far are:

* We're flying in and out of Hailar. I've heard Hulunbuir is wilder than Hohhot, and would like to be as off the beaten track as possible
* We are flying back via Beijing, because I think it would be such a waste of a visa not to visit the Forbidden City and the Great Wall - have to do some traditional tourist things!
* 5-6 nights in Inner Mongolia? At least a few in proper yurt encampments
* Maybe staying a night in Manzhouli? Is it worth it?

I have a couple of questions and would really appreciate some answers!

1. Would we get bored after 5 days in the grasslands, or is that not enough? We want to ride, cook, meet people, take photos, and hike - also happy to volunteer to help out in settlements.
2. How can we actually sort out staying in the wild? In the limited videos and Tripadvisor reviews seen it seems like people book a private driver literally when they arrive at the airport. I definitely want some certainty beforehand...
3. How do you find a driver? There isn't an obvious travel information desk, understandably, and shelling out for a guide when we'll just want a driver and to meet local people seems unnecessary
4. My boyfriend is intrigued by the Ewenki people raising reindeer. Would it be ridiculous to try to stay or visit them? I have no idea where to start, and if this isn't normally done by tourists I assume the drivers wouldn't know exactly what to do.

I'd really appreciate some advice! I hope none of this comes across as insensitive in any way - I want to be respectful and properly honour the culture of the place I'm visiting, so if anything I've asked is stupidly/offensively/badly worded please say! I'm not sure what the vibe is with foreigners just coming up and asking to be involved - is this rude, or do people generally accept and encourage non-Chinese tourists?",2025-04-01 14:36:41,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,15,8,,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jox5ek/inner_mongolia/,Careful-Builder-9931

The Camino de Santiago routes interest me a lot, it's no walk in the park but it is a challenge I'd like to take on. Not the entire expedition, but at least do part of it.

On the trams you have a green button to press to open the door but buses don’t. How do I get off quicker? Do you have to tap before your stop? How will they get an accurate distance then? But if I have a GVB card I suppose it’s fine?

1k4cgww,reddit,Small tips about taking the train between Amsterdam and Berlin,"I just boarded the direct train (Intercity Berlijn) from Amsterdam to Berlin, which I assume is a popular route for European tourists but most of the information on the official operator's website (NS) and even some information at the train station was completely wrong. So here's my experience in case it helps someone:

1. 1st class will be on 1 end of the train, but at Berlin Hauptbahnhof station, the train map was completely reversed. To make matters worse, there is actually no way to get between 2nd class and 1st class cars on this train, so literally all 1st class passengers were sprinting from 1 end of the (very crowded) platform to the other end to get onto the train (also the train arrived at 14:05 with scheduled departure of 14:10 so there was real risk you could miss the train if you didn't run). I would actually suggest standing in the middle of the platform and then you can avoid this rush either way.
2. If you book this particular train online, you can request a seat reservation but you can't select the seat, or even request a window / aisle. I strongly suggest calling the reservation hotline instead to request a specific seat.
3. For 1st class specifically, on the NS website, it said very clearly that 1st class seats only have power outlets on the window. This is false, actually there are power outlets under every seat - but only the window and middle seats have access to a desk. If you are planning to do work / use your laptop (which I assume many people are doing on this nearly 6 hour train ride) then you should really try to get the window seat >> middle seat, again which requires calling the NS phone number in advance.
4. This only changed a few months ago so I can't blame the internet for being wrong, but there is no longer a dining car on this train, just a snack cart.
5. This is just personal opinion but unlike many other intercity trains, this one actually can get quite full (according to another passenger in my compartment who travels this route regularly) and people are sitting on the floor in 2nd class. Keep in mind this is April, not even peak travel season. I would say it's pretty much a necessity to book a seat reservation in 2nd class or just spring for 1st class.",2025-04-21 12:37:59,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,8,9,,0.65,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k4cgww/small_tips_about_taking_the_train_between/,Dry_Row_7523
1k47543,reddit,First Time Flying Fiji Airways – Surprisingly Great Experience (DFW to Sydney),"Just got back from a trip from Dallas (DFW) to Sydney via Fiji Airways—my first time flying with them, and honestly, I was impressed, especially flying economy.

I bought my round-trip ticket just 2 days before departure for only $749, which was an absolute steal for a last-minute international flight.

Check-in at DFW was smooth. The only thing that stood out was the 4-hour layover in Fiji. The staff mentioned that if your layover is over 3 hours, they need to get immigration clearance or adjust you to an earlier connecting flight. Apparently, it’s because the Fiji airport is smaller and they try to manage congestion—which actually made sense.

In-flight experience:
	•	Big legroom in economy
	•	Food was surprisingly good (though could’ve been a bit warmer)
	•	Staff were friendly
	•	Overall very comfortable for a long-haul

Super happy with the experience, especially considering the last-minute fare.

Was it a group tour if so what kind and where? Or was it some kind of special activity you did? Or some kind of special hotel you stayed at?

1jugoec,reddit,INDONESIA: Please help me find the dreamiest beach stay.,"Hi! I am planning a very last minute trip to Indonesia this month for my 35th birthday. I think we'll have a total of 9 days. I would like to do 4-5 nights in Bali and 4 nights somewhere super relaxing on the beach. From everything I've read Uluwatu seems like the best place for us to stay, we'll likely do a day trip to Ubud just to see it. It looks beautiful but I'm not sure it's worth staying. What do you think?

Is Uluwatu a good place to stay in Bali for a couple both in their mid 30s? We are looking for a good mix of party/relaxation for the first days.

I need the most help deciding on the latter half of this trip, I initially wanted to do the Maldives for 4 nights but getting there is so complicated I figured we could find a beautiful beach somewhere in Indonesia. This part of the trip is purely for relaxation, we want to do nothing but sit on a beautiful calm beach, go to the spa, and snorkel. I have looked into Gilli T, but haven't found any true luxury hotels. Not to be pretentious, we don't get to travel this far often so we're looking for a hotel that I won't stop thinking about when I get home to the US. I looked into the infamous Nihi hotel but $5000 a night is insanity so I'll just have to keep that on my wishlist for when i hit the lottery.  
  
Any and suggestions are welcome from food to activities! We are adventurous and will consider it all.  
We originally chose Indonesia because I wanted to swim with whale sharks, but I was ignorant to how truly widespread Indonesia is.

  
Thank you in advance!

My wife and I (from Scandinavia) are planning a 30-day honeymoon adventure and would love advice from anyone who’s visited Mauritius, Réunion, and Seychelles in one go. We're drawn to wild nature, tropical islands, snorkeling, hiking, and spotting wildlife—but we also need to avoid places with Zika virus, yellow fever, or malaria, as we're currently trying to conceive.

We originally planned a dream route from Iquitos, Peru, through the Amazon to Manaus, Brazil (3 weeks in the jungle), ending with a week on Dominica. Unfortunately, that's no longer an option due to health risks.

Now we're considering spending a month split between Seychelles, Mauritius, and Réunion. We'd love to hear:

* Has anyone done this combo? Was it logistically manageable?
* Did it offer enough variety in nature, hiking, snorkeling, and wildlife?

We’re also actively looking for other destination ideas that meet these criteria:

* Tropical nature, beaches, hiking, snorkeling, jungle treks, wildlife
* No Zika, yellow fever, or malaria
* Feels somewhat off-the-beaten path or less touristy
* No need to rent a car – we don’t drive
* Budget: 6,700 EUR / 7,200 USD for two people including flights
* Prefer Airbnb or guesthouses over resorts
* Fine with traveling between two fairly distant places (e.g., Azores + Seychelles)

Some other places we’re considering:

* The Azores (Portugal)
* Okinawa (Japan)

If anyone has experienced both Okinawa and the Indian Ocean islands (Mauritius, Réunion, Seychelles), we’d love to hear your thoughts—was one more special or adventurous? And if Okinawa stands out, any ideas for a second destination to pair it with that fits our nature-loving, low-risk criteria?

1jwp0kt,reddit,Help us out with our itinerary: North Argentina / Chile / Peru (or Bolivia?),"Hola fellow travellers!  

We are on a three-month sabbatical trip. Currently, we are close to finishing two weeks in Patagonia, which has been amazing. In about a week's time, we will arrive in Salta, but we are unsure how to continue our journey from there and would love some advice from travellers who have explored the area before.  

One thing we do know for sure is that we need to be in Cusco on day 16 or day 17 (in the morning) for the start of the Salkantay trek on day 19.  

### Some key info  
- High-paced travellers  
- Early 30s  
- Not a fan of night buses  
- Very diverse interests: nature, culture, food, small villages, but also big cities  
- After the itinerary below, we will continue to Puerto Maldonado (Amazon), Lima, Galapagos, Colombia  
- Flying is not an issue if it saves time  
- Good budget, but not unlimited  
- Heard road safety in Bolivia is not great, so trying to limit time in Bolivia  

### Questions  
1. In general, any recommendations based on the current draft itinerary? Places to add or skip?  
2. We are unsure whether to add Salar de Uyuni. Since we are also visiting Salinas Grandes, we wonder if it would be redundant  
3. How would you incorporate Salar de Uyuni? Which places would you skip or decrease the number of days in?  

### Our plan so far  
- Day 1: Arrive in Salta in the morning, pick up a car for self-drive and explore Salta
- Day 2: Stay at a ranch close to Salta  
- Day 3: Ranch → Tilcara  
- Day 4: Tilcara (Salinas Grandes, Humahuaca, Purmamarca)  
- Day 5: Tilcara (Salinas Grandes, Humahuaca, Purmamarca)  
- Day 6: Tilcara → Cachi  
- Day 7: Cachi → Cafayate  
- Day 8: Cafayate  
- Day 9: Cafayate → Salta  
- Day 10: Salta → San Pedro de Atacama (travel during the day)  
- Day 11: San Pedro de Atacama (tours)  
- Day 12: San Pedro (tours)  
- Day 13: San Pedro (entire day in San Pedro for tours, travel via Arica and Tacna to Arequipa at night)  
- Day 14: Arrive in Arequipa in the morning  
- Day 15: Arequipa  
- Day 16: Arequipa → Cusco (flight)  
- Day 17: Cusco (explore city)  
- Day 18: Cusco (Sacred Valley)  
- Day 19: Cusco (start Salkantay Trek).

So if Amsterdam is too similar to Copenhagen  what would you suggest? No Portugal, no Spain, no Italy, no Greece, no Istanbul, no UK, and no Paris.

My spouse and I enjoy active trips where we will (sometimes reluctantly) see the obligatory sites, but also love exploring and doing a bit more adventuring than most. For instance, we went to Belize and did a spear fishing excursion where we got to eat what we caught. 

We are looking between Ireland or Spain. I did some research and many do not compare these two places and the reason I am is simply because they are the cheapest tickets in the late September/early October window we would be traveling. I thought Ireland would be it hands down to see castles and drive the country, along with some incredible museums. But then as I was looking at Spain with all of its historical sites and landmarks, I am actually more partial to that now.

For Ireland we would fly in and out of Dublin, probably stay in 2-3 Airbnbs throughout the country to get around and see other places. Spain we would be flying into Barcelona and out of Madrid, probably staying in 1-2 spots in between those two.

1jthqwc,reddit,Travelling then vs. now,"Hey fellow travellers!

I have recently visited some of the few EU countries that I hadn’t yet been to, and I have mixed feelings about my experience.

Prague is a prime example of my biggest issue with modern-day tourism. First of all, don’t get me wrong: Prague is a beautiful city and definitely one of the highlights of my trip. However, it felt like the city had 10x the amount of tourists than it was originally designed to accommodate. 

Furthermore, the historical center felt like a movie set created for tourists. Chimney cake vendors, Thai Massage parlours, souvenir shops and neon-lit weed stores every few steps. It was difficult to find authentic local bakeries, shops or commerce catered to actual residents.

I realise that I’m no different than any of the other tourists in the city, but I feel like a lot of popular travel destinations worldwide are becoming copies of one another, losing a lot of their authenticity and original flair. Also, due to the crazy amount of tourists everywhere, it is sometimes really hard to enjoy a nice atmosphere due to having to shoulder your way through people on the sidewalks.

All this makes me wonder: How was travelling like before internet and online influencers? I’m in my early 30’s and perhaps would have had a much better time travelling 30, 40 or 50 years ago. 

Also, do you think things will only get worse in the future, or is travelling gonna go out of fashion eventually?",2025-04-07 10:09:20,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,8,18,,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jthqwc/travelling_then_vs_now/,DundieAwardsWinner

1jykwkh,reddit,Where to go for 3-4 day trip in Bolivia?,"Hello all. I am headed down to Paraguay in a few months and am considering doing a stop in Bolivia on the way there. Coming from the U.S. I am looking at la paz and santa cruz de la sierra bolivia, probably arriving thursday evening and heading out to paraguay Sunday early afternoon.

Santa Cruz seems like it has the better arrival times, no issues with altitude, and a nonstop to Asunción, but La Paz looks more interesting to me for the old ski lodge, chola fighting and Andean food, but also seems to have some of the worst arrival times to get there and  have to time it correctly to transit to Asuncíon on sunday (assuming there is a flight available).

I am curious to hear anyones thoughts who has done either of these spots. I am also considering skipping it if this is too rushed of a trip.

1jwnvrn,reddit,Crossing Albanian borders,"Hello travelers! 

I will soon visit North Macedonia for 12 days, and will get there by bus from Albania (Flixbus). 
I would like to know if they will scan my passeport at the border. 
The reason for this is that as a french guy, I am not allowed to stay more than 90 days in Albania. 
Going to North Macedonia saves me 10 full days of being in Albania, and therefore I will not exceed the limit of 90 days when I will fly back to France (from Albania). 
If my passport is not scanned at the border, then they will think I stayed too much in their country and I will get an expensive fine (~1000€), so I need to know if this would work. 
Could someone help me with this?

1jw45o5,reddit,Best Luggage Tracking for Android (Pixel 8 pro),"Soooo....finally experienced the horror that is lost luggage. While waiting on one of my two bags, I was approached by a friendly member of the airline's luggage team (I'd been waiting for 20+ minutes). She kindly informed me my luggage was left at the origin of my trip, and that I'd need to file a claim. OK, sh\*t. Fast forward, the bag wasn't lost, nor at another airport, it was in fact at the arrival airport; I received the bag the next morning.

All that to say: I need a good Android Luggage Tracker.

All my research has done nothing but lead to much confusion re: what is really best for Android users who travel frequently. I know there is no real Air Tag alternative, I understand Android Bluetooth trackers frequently lack accuracy, but I'd still like some real world advice on what works and what doesn't.

1ju706g,reddit,Is Late October or Late November a Better Time to Travel to Europe?,"Hi everyone!

My husband and I are planning our first trip to Europe and need some advice. We’re considering flying into Budapest (we have direct flights) and are trying to decide whether to visit Italy or Greece alongside Budapest. We’ve also heard that Portugal and Spain could be great options, but we’re concerned about spending too much time on travel, as we only have 9 days total.

# Details:

* Starting from: We’re coming from the Middle East and never been to Europe except Turkey.
* Travel dates: Late October (Oct 24-31) or Late November (Nov 22-28).
* Interests: We love exploring history, culture, food, and local landmarks. We’re particularly interested in ancient sites, museums, nature, and trying local cuisines. We’re not into hiking or outdoor activities, but we enjoy city walks and immersing ourselves in local life. We’re looking for a relaxed trip with plenty of time to enjoy the sights at a leisurely pace.

We’re wondering whether late October or late November would be a better time to visit Europe for sightseeing. We’ve heard mixed reviews about the weather, especially regarding November, and we want to avoid cold, rainy, or gloomy days as we’re not used to such weather. Also, would it be better to focus on **Budapest + Italy/Greece** or would Budapest + **Portugal/Spain** be a good option despite the potential travel time?

Edit: We would only be spending a day or 2 in Budapest. We are visiting the place coz we have direct flights to Budapest.

Now, we're looking to explore other parts of Japan and were hoping to get some recommendations on the best/nicest cities to visit, specifically with vegetarian-friendly food in mind.

We know Japan isn't always the easiest place for vegetarians, especially outside of the major cities, but we're up for a bit of a challenge if the destination is worth it. Ideally, we're looking for places that have:

* A solid variety of vegetarian-friendly restaurants (not just one or two options)
* Interesting regional cuisine that can be adapted for vegetarians
* A great overall travel experience with scenery, culture, history, and walkability

We've been in Japan in November and April in previous years, but this time we found some great flight prices for December. We’re curious if that time of year impacts food options in any way or if there are any unique seasonal specialties worth trying.

We've heard that places like Osaka and Fukuoka might have some good vegetarian options, but we’re open to anywhere. Bonus points for any personal recommendations of specific restaurants or dishes to try!

Obviously, given the size of the country and the distances/travel times, the goal wouldn't be to travel throughout the country, but rather to focus on one region and a few short stops. Do you think there's an itinerary that would lend itself fairly easily to this type of travel? It seemed to me that central Mongolia was the most accessible region by public transport.

1k1me4b,reddit,Portugal Itinerary Advice: 7 Days,"This October my wife and I will be visiting Portugal for our 5 year anniversary. We are looking for a mostly relaxing, not overpacked trip as it’s our one week away from our preschool son (our parents are watching him during the trip).

We have already booked a flight to fly into Porto that arrives Sunday morning. We fly out the following Saturday morning.

We definitely want to do the Duoro valley and Porto.

I’m trying to decide between the following two itineraries 

Option 1:  4 nights in Duoro, 2 Nights in Porto. 

This could also be split up 3 and 3. Idea would be to stay at a couple different quintas (or splurge for a couple nights at the six senses resort. My big question here is if that is too much time in Duoro. We both like wine but aren’t obsessed.

Option 2: 2 nights in Duoro, 2 nights in Lisbon, 2 nights in Porto

Would spent the first couple days in Duoro, then catch the train to Lisbon spend a couple nights and catch and train back to Porto for the last two nights. Obviously this would allow us to see more but we wouldn’t want to be over-rushed.

Of note we would plan to rent a car for however long we are in Duoro then return it after.

Thoughts?

1jzr1hr,reddit,Looking for some additional cities/counties to go to before I finish my Europe trip?,"In a few months time, I will be embarking on my first trip to Spain and Portugal. I (26 M) am solo travelling and then doing a contiki group tour and my itineary so far is as follows:

San Sebastian - 4 days solo traveliing (I'm a huge foodie and love going for beach walks - i think this is the perfect city to relax in before the group tour).  
Madrid - 2 days (I will spend a day and a half here before beginning my group tour) Cordoba - One night as part of group tour Seville- 2 days (as part of group tour)  
Portugal - 6 days (Lisbon, Porto and Algrave)  
Salamanca - 1 day  
Madrid - end group tour and explore more of madrid for 3 days doing solo travelling.

I will probably do a lot of bus travelling and partying as part of my group tour, so i'm looking for potentially finding a city that is more relaxing. I'm also conscious of not getting too overwhelmed with all the travelling since it is my first time in Europe.

After the Spain and Portugal portion, I'm trying to figure out where to go next before I fly home. I'm thinking of either doing London, Como or Bern (3 very different locations I know). However, I think only doing Como without exploring more of Italy would feel too short. Bern looks cool because there’s a nice lake to swim in and it would be interesting to get a glimpse of everyday life in Switzerland, and London just feels like a cool city to visit overall—big, lively, and very different from the rest of my itinerary so far.

That being said, I’m looking for suggestions for additional places that might be a good contrast to everything I’m already doing. Somewhere a bit more chill would be ideal—bonus points if it's near nature (mountains/lakes/ocean), has good food, and doesn’t require a crazy amount of travel from Spain or Portugal. I’m trying to avoid burning out with too many flights or overly packed travel days.

Also, since I’ll be solo traveling again after the group tour ends, I’d love to go somewhere that’s solo-travel-friendly and safe—somewhere that doesn’t feel too isolating and where there’s a good chance to meet other travelers or locals. Whether it’s a social hostel scene (ideally I would like to stay in a hotel thought), walking tours, or just a generally friendly vibe, I’d really appreciate any advice on cities that fit that.

Would love to hear any thoughts or personal recommendations—especially if anyone has done a similar route or solo traveled in these places.

1jykb2f,reddit,Towns/cities with unique/preserved urban architecture styles?,"I am interested in towns that have been able to preserve unique urban architecture styles (that generally predate the 1800's). It seems that in most places, once industrialization took hold the local architecture style was ditched for a more uniform western style (whether due to colonization or western hegemony).

I am not interested in places that only have 1 or 2 buildings with a given style (such as a cathedral or palace), but places with a very high saturation of these buildings. 

As an example, [Berat](https://imgur.com/a/berat-PJsF2SG) and [Gjirokastre](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.0741952,20.1385301,3a,75y,145.42h,97.5t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1stZxBo7zvclJLjkeyV_NFaQ!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D-7.504916289099654%26panoid%3DtZxBo7zvclJLjkeyV_NFaQ%26yaw%3D145.4228274316431!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDQwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) in Albania have preserved 16th century ottoman architecture very well. While this style can be found in small pockets throughout the Balkans, there is nothing at the saturation of these two. I was able to visit these places over the summer and I found them fascinating

Other examples:

[La Alberca, Spain](https://imgur.com/a/D0RGsq2)

[Srinigar, India](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Wo8xx8xADRVLpMXg9)

[Foroglia, Switzerland](https://imgur.com/a/JEWzdrl)

[Sana'a, Yemen](https://imgur.com/a/COGfs8J)

I guess the goal is to find places that still seem representative of the way they were 200+ years ago in terms of architecture (so I can visit + wander around them :). This is easy enough in Europe, but when trying to find examples in Asia or Africa it becomes much harder. Even within Europe, trying to find examples of pre-industrial architecture is a challenge.

1jw9cre,reddit,11 Days in Europe,"Hi everyone,

I’d really appreciate some help making a travel decision! In June, I’ll be spending 14 days in Spain (Barcelona, Madrid, Toledo, Granada, and Seville)—that portion of the trip is already planned and booked. After that, I’ll have 11 unscheduled days before I return to work, and I’d love to spend them exploring somewhere else in Europe, but I’m torn on where to go.

I’ll be traveling with my mom during those 11 days. In the past, we’ve visited England, Italy, Greece, Spain, and France, so we’re hoping to experience somewhere new. We tend to travel at a fairly fast pace—we enjoy having full days—but we also prefer spending an extended amount of time in one country, rather than hopping around too much.

One option we’re considering is Portugal. We were thinking something like 3 days in Porto, 3 in Lisbon (with a day trip to Sintra), and 3 in the Douro Valley (we’d love to do the Paiva Walkways). Our only hesitation is that we might feel like we’re missing out by not making it down to the Algarve.

Another idea was a mix of Amsterdam, Vienna, and Prague. We both love great food, art museums (the Picasso Museum in Paris is my all-time favorite), walking through cities, and a bit of nature as well.

With that in mind, do you have any thoughts on Portugal vs. the Amsterdam/Vienna/Prague route—or any other recommendations that might fit the bill? We’re hoping to keep the budget around $4,000 total (not including flights).

1jw5m04,reddit,Quick trip to Bali. (Trip report),"I’m sure Bali has been covered 1 million times but here is a quick 9 night trip report.

 

40 Male- 40 Female couple USA/NYC

 

We flew Singapore Airlines from JFK-SIN-DPS. My first time on Singapore airlines.  We booked “Premium Economy” exit row. What we didn’t realize is that on this flight there is no Economy class. Only First, Business and premium economy. So essentially if you are Premium economy you are in Economy class. Regardless, the seats were comfortable enough, and the food was impressive. The exit row provided unlimited leg room, making it easy to stand up to stretch or use the facilities.

 

We arrived at DPS around 11am and our hotel provided free pickup from the airport.

We met our driver and headed to Ubud. We stayed at Ubud village hotel. The Hotel was on the main drag right in the middle of town. However once inside, the chaos of the main street was nonexistent. The property was very quiet and serene. We had a room facing the pool. The room was very clean and spacious with a very large balcony. The pool area was also very nice, with comfortable loungers and friendly staff offering towels. The pool area also had a bar with happy hour specials.

On our arrival day we just walked around town for a bit and had an early dinner. We went to sleep early from the jetlag.

Day 2 we woke up early, went to a local coffee shop and had a light breakfast. Next, we walked down the road to the monkey forest. We spent a few hours there walking around and taking in the scenery. Afterwards we walked up to Ubud palace and Ubud water temple. Had lunch and visited the market.

 

 

Day 3 we hired a driver using Get your guide. Our driver picked us up at 8am. We headed to 3 different waterfalls, the famous water temple, rice terrace and a coffee plantation. The guide was great, and I highly recommend using get your guide to arrange a private tour.

 

Day 4 we arranged a ride with our hotel to take us to our next location, Sanur beach.

In Sanur we stayed at Hotel 101. Another great stay. We had a room on the first level with direct access to the pool. There are two pools at this hotel, I would recommend trying to have a room near the pool in the rear.  The front pool seemed a bit overcrowded and noisy.

Sanur overall was a good fit for us, it has an older more laidback crowd. But still, lots to see and do. We checked out an Irish pub that had live music (the wicked parrot).

Day 5 we just walked around town and visited some shops and the beach, nothing important to mention.

Day 6 we used Grab for a ride the Sanur harbor. We used Setia ferry to take us to Nusa Lembongon. The ferry was great, and the boarding process was very organized.

Once on Nusa Lembongon we stayed at Lembongon Summer hotel. The hotel is made up of 4 private bungalows. Each with a mini plunge pool. We were very impressed with how nice this stay was. It was close to the main road but far enough back to be quiet and peaceful.   On NL there are no cars. Only motor bikes and mini pickup trucks (taxis). We opted to not rent motor bikes and instead use the taxis or walk.  

Day 7 we arranged a SCUBA diving trip with Legend divers, and it was a great day. We went to manta point and got to dive with giant manta rays.

Day 8 we took a taxi to dream beach and spent the day at D’bayus beach club. It was a small beach bar that served light food and was playing some great music. Very relaxing day.

 

Three restaurants to mention on NL.  Little Prema BBQ for fresh grilled fish, Lemongrass for pizza and cocktails and Curry traders for Indian and cocktails.

 

Day 9 we headed back to the mainland and arranged a ride using Klook. Our driver met us in the ferry arrivals area and easily took us to Kuta to our hotel Grandmas Plus Hotel Legian. The hotel was fine for one night, no complaints. It is right in the middle of town, so plenty to do. We got some small tattoos at Rose tattoo Bali. Good clean shop with treasonable prices. Both tattoos came out nice.  Later, we walked over to the beach and hung out at one of the beach bars for sunset.  

 

Final day we once again used Klook for a 4am pick up to take us to the airport. The driver was there on time and got us to the airport without any issues. 

 

To wrap it all up, this was my first time to Bali, and I was a bit apprehensive at first. I usually try to avoid visiting overly touristic places.  However, I really enjoyed our quick trip and would defiantly like to return for a longer visit.

I used the seat boost for the condor flight and was the only one on the bidding list, so my bid was accepted at the opening bid price of $595.

For my Lufthansa flight I also put in a bid at the lowest possible bid of $575 which was accepted 2 days before the flight. I've never had an upgrade on Lufthansa be accepted so I was really surprised.

1jptnbw,reddit,Any EU citizen who recently visited Guyana by land?,"Hi everyone,

I am currently planning my trip to Suriname and Guyana and as you all probably know, there is very little information out there about these countries. 
I wanna go overland from Brazil to French Guiana, Suriname and finally Guyana and unfortunately Guyana is the only one that requires visa for (some) EU citizens (I am Czech). On top of that, my country does not have Guyanese embassy and even if it did, I am currently in Colombia so it wouldn’t help me anyway. 

From official government website it seems that for countries like mine with no options to obtain visa home, you can get visa on arrival but one of the requirements is an invitation letter of your host and I am not sure if an airbnb host or a hotel would be enough?

I’ve also found few reports from travelers that you can basicly just show up at the border and get a stamp but lot of these reports are pretty outdated and since this part of the world is pretty remote and not easily accesible, I wanna make sure I come prepared, especially because my flight back to Colombia would be from Georgetown.
Does anyone here (preferably an EU citizen) have recent experience with this?

Wanting to validate if anyone had the same customs experience we did at EWR from Italy with an overnight stay in Copenhagen. It was our first time flying international via EWR (vs we typically fly from JFK). We each had a checked bag while I have Global Entry and my husband does not (not sure if that makes any difference) with us in the same booking.

We breezed through Passport Control in Terminal B, claimed our bags and passed a single Xray machine where it appeared people were only being stopped randomly. We didn’t get stopped but hesitated and tried to ask but the guys working the xray line weren’t paying attention/stopping anyone other than the 1 guy they were dealing with. Otherwise, we (and many people before and around us) just took our bags and moved forward expecting another customs checkpoint but were suddenly outside the airport!

No customs paperwork. No lines. Just grab your bags and go. I feel like we missed a step somewhere since we’re so used to JFK but were directed where to go each step of the way except after baggage claim. We were expecting to have to declare some wine and purchases from Italy (under the $1600 limit for 2 ppl).",2025-04-01 12:02:04,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,4,4,,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jotup8/ewr_customs_experience/,qball28

1jkqvnh,reddit,2 week trip to india - changed hotel booking after getting the Visa. Is it a problem?,"Hi! 
I am traveling to india in 6 days, already got my Visa in order and everything. 
Only problem is, in the Visa, they asked me to put an address for a hotel i booked or the address of someone I'm staying at. I put there a hostel reservation I had booked beforehand, in shimla. I got my Visa but then changed my mind and cancelled the booking because I wanted to go to rishikesh instead. I cancelled the hostel in shimla, and booked one in rishikesh. 

My question is, will I get in any trouble for this at the customs when arriving? Is there any chance that they'll ask ne where I'm staying, or something similar? And if I say that I'm staying in rishikesh, but they see on the Visa that I put shimla, will this be a problem? 

Or, if I say I'm going to Shimla, to not get in any trouble, will they ask me for a booking confirmation? (Which I don't have since I cancelled my booking). 

I'm traveling from the EU btw, and thanks for the help! Its my first time traveling this far, so im a bit scared.

I am drafting an itinerary for this summer (end of july/beginning of August), we are a couple and we are planning on staying 12 days on Peru (we can eventually add or remove some days as we are flexible).

This Is the itinerary that I was planning:
**Day 1-4 Cusco**
We plan on staying 4 days in Cusco, visiting the city and its ruins and planning some excursions (e.g. Rainbow mountains, Humantay lake)
**Day 5 Sacred Valley tour**
We plan on departing from Cusco to visit the Sacred Valley (Maras, Moray, Pisac), ending the day with a train from Ollantaytambo to Aguas Calientes (spending the night in AC)
**Day 6 Macchu Picchu**
Pretty self explanatory, planning on visiting MP on the morning, train to Ollantaytambo in the afternoon and spending the night there
** Day 7 Ollantaytambo**
We plan on spending a day in Ollantaytambo as I've heard great things about it online, then we plan on catching a transport to Cusco in the late afternoon, in order to catch a night bus to Pino
**Day 8-9 Lake Titicaca**
Coming to Puno in the early morning, we plan on hopping on a 2 days 1 night tour. I've seen online that a lot of travel agencies are offering different itineraries. What's the best itinerary in your opinion?
**Day 10-11 Colca Valley**
From Puno, we plan on hopping on a 2 days 1 night tour starting from Puno and ending in Arequipa.

Does someone have experience with this kind of tour? What's a recommended tour operator?
**Day 12 Arequipa**
We plan on visiting the city, I've read online that one day Is enough, we will depart from Arequipa on day 13.

I was looking for advices on this draft, as already said we are flexible with the number of days, we are planning on visiting Mexico right after our trip to Peru.",2025-04-23 15:08:11,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,5,14,,0.85,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k61inq/itinerary_check_12_days_in_peru/,Certain-Question1483

1k4j6bm,reddit,April: Sicily or Mexico,"Good evening team. My kids are getting old enough now to travel a little more adventurously.

Due to the nature of my job it's often necessary to plan holidays a year in advance, so we're already looking at next year's Easter holidays.

Two options we are considering are Sicily and Mexico.

If Mexico, we would consider 7-8 days in Mexico City and plan trips, sight seeing and excursions (ideally with cooking/proper local food experiences), followed by an internal flight and then 4-5 days in Cancun to visit Chichen Itza, and spend some time by the sea or at a resort to fully relax for a couple of days before flying home.

If Sicily we would rent a car (we are used to driving in South Italy, Greece, etc - we know what the roads and drivers can be like) and plan something more of a tour around and stay in smaller villas and B&Bs in villages, towns, to see a lot more of the incredible island.

Two very different trips, but both would provide a mixture of (varying) exploration and relaxation. They both seem to be a good step up from our previous holidays when the kids were littler towards the more rough and ready travel my wife and I were used to (kids will be 10 and 8 by next spring).

(My wife has decent Spanish, I have lower-intermediate Italian - but I know that may not necessarily translate all over Sicily)

So, for people that have been to either or both - what were your experiences of these sorts of itineraries at that time of year? Are there better plans for family trips in those areas?

The first 5/6 days I'm doing an organised trek to Mount Toubkal, and then the last 7 days I'm doing another tour of Northern Morocco, starting in Casablanca (although not really spending any time there) and then Tangiers, Fez, Marrakesh and various places along the way.

I'll have a 2 days in between both tours where I'll be based in Marrakesh, and I want to do a couple of days trips. I've identified the 4 following possibilities, so I'd be grateful if anyone had any thoughts on any of them so that I can pick 2 (also open to any suggestions not listed below that people might have).

Note: Both organised long tours include time in Marrakesh so Marrakesh will be covered.

\* Go to Casablanca a day early so I can see the sights there (as it isn't actually included in the second tour I'm doing)

\* Agadir - Day Trip (I appreciate it's quite a distance from Marrakesh)

1k1xzlt,reddit,Rate my Romania itinerary,"I put this together with special emphasis on Jewish history (because my Jewish family is partially from Romania and we have almost no info about them) as well as communist/eastern bloc history because it interests me. That’s why I’ve decided to visit transnistria and iasi. I will be visiting in July and early august.

I of course have heard that brasov and timisoara are cool. I can’t figure out how to get them on this itinerary because I really deeply wanted to hike a portion of via transilvanica but I definitely welcome feedback if you feel I’m really missing out. I don’t think I’ll be renting a car as the whole via transilvanica thing makes that extra complicated. Plus I’m by myself and I feel like public trans makes more sense.

Day 1: fly into chisinau. 

Day 2: day trip to transnistria (think I will splurge on a Russian-speaking guide). Stay in chisinau

Day 3: bus to iasi
Days 4-5 explore iasi

day 6: travel to putna Monastery

1jzshfo,reddit,Looking for an autumnal resort getaway this fall in the US. Planning to propose to my girlfriend of four years.,"Hey there! I wanted to pop into this subreddit to get some advice for a possible proposal trip I'm trying to plan for this fall. My three goals are as follows:

1. Find an autumnal resort of some kind that has all sorts of fall themed activities to do
2. Hopefully find a good renaissance festival that isn't too far away happening at the same time
3. Schedule it so I can pop the question on October 11th (our anniversary)

We've been ren-faire goers for a while now, but are wanting a fall festival to attend to get a change of atmosphere. I'm hoping that, while attempting to accomplish this, I can have us stay at some fall themed resort. My girlfriend loves the fall season and changing leaves.

Ultimately, this resort idea was inspired by an ASMR series on YouTube from the creator Goodnight Moon. Every fall she posts a new video featuring a roleplay of a hotel check in at her recently dubbed ""Mahogany Lodge"" where she goes over all sorts of fall themed activities and scenery to enjoy at this fictional location. Basically, I'm trying to find this sort of place. One that actually exists lol. If any of your guys know of such a location, please let me know! I'd greatly appreciate your help.

If it happens to be located not too terribly far from a renaissance festival, that's bonus points to me.

1jzrq7x,reddit,Solo travelling Europe at 16,"TLDR: My experience solo travelling Europe at 16 coming from New Zealand and the planning side of things. Traveled through London, Barcelona, Andorra, Warsaw, Budapest, Berlin, Munich, Prague, and Istanbul. Encountered no major safety issues and met lots of nice people through hostels and walking tours. Hoping to inspire others under 18 who want to travel independently.

This is for all those under 18 who want to travel but don't know how. I'm about to turn 17 and i'm planning a solo trip around east Asia, but I first wanted to talk about my solo trip to Europe. I'm from New Zealand and had always loved travelling, at 15 I went on an exchange year to California, USA, and whilst there I had met a couple of other exchange students from Europe. A year later, I wanted to go explore, so after the school year finished, I compiled all my money (from my part time job and extra savings), I had around $7000NZD and started booking flights and hotels.

At first, I did some googling to find where I could stay as most places would not let minors check in to hotels - flying alone was fine as I had flown numerous times alone. I was on reddit (there wasn't a lot of info about this, so i'm hoping this post will help others), but I found out YHA London had a ton of hostels throughout London that would allow minors to check in, so I booked 2 nights there (YHA Oxford St). This made me realise that there were DEFINITELY hostels/hotels out there that would allow minors to check in. And so my trip began...

I flew 13 hours from AKL to LAX, (as I said before I had previously lived in Cali for a bit so LA was pretty familiar to me), I had a LONG layover so I left the airport, went to Grand Central Market for some lunch, then took a train (LA public transport is really not that bad) to meet some friends and then went back to the airport, had a nap, and slept for the next 12 hours on the flight to London. I arrived in London in the evening, went straight to the hostel and checked in and continued to sleep until the morning. After 2 days (definitely not enough) in London, seeing all the sights, I hopped on a flight to Barcelona which was a very last minute decision, I had literally changed my itinerary a week before, as I wanted to go snowboarding in Andorra. Anyway, when I got to Barcelona in the evening, I was confused on where to meet my bus. I was stressed and waiting along time when finally my bus came and it was 3 more hours to Andorra le Vella. Booking a hotel here was a nightmare, I think I must've called every single hotel in the city or looked through their FAQs to see whether a minor was allowed to check in, but I found ONE (im sorry I forgot the name, it's a local owned one). After snowboarding in Andorra, I went back to Barcelona, spent the day there, and then went back to the airport to Warsaw, Poland.

In Warsaw, I stayed at the Kapsula Hotel (a capsule hotel), they allowed minors to stay here on the condition of a signed consent form from parents. This was also by far the cheapest hostel I found ($18NZD a night) and it was really clean and pretty spacious considering it was a capsule. After Warsaw, I flew to Budapest and stayed at the Maverick City Lodge in the Jewish Quarter which also needed a consent form to stay here. There's a lot of good nightlife and food around this area. I then flew to Berlin where I stayed at the MEININGER hotel in Alexanderplatz (this is a hotel chain all around Europe), where they also required a consent form. The hotel was right next door to one of the subway stops which went straight to the city centre which was a bonus. I then flew to Munich and stayed at A&O hostels, which is also a hotel chain all around Europe, that allowed minors to stay there with a consent form (up to 14 years old! Whereas the rest you had to be 16). Then I took the earliest train to Prague and spent the entire day walking around the Old Town, going to museums etc.

And finally flew to Istanbul, Turkey (was upgraded free to first class!). I was here for what was supposed to be a 1 hour layover but was delayed to over 7 hours. I had landed in Istanbul at exactly midnight and had no idea what to do. So, as someone who wanted to explore, I left the airport in the middle of the night and googled what to see in Istanbul and took a taxi all the way to the Hagia Sophia Grand Mosque. I was genuinely so tired and half way through the one hour taxi ride, I asked the taxi driver if we could turn back to the airport (I had seen that the airport had sleeping pods), BUT the taxi driver insisted I go see the mosque. He was a really nice guy, he actually made a couple of stops on the way at some other landmarks and offered to take some photos for me, which I'm so grateful for. Then eventually, went back to the airport, I had walked all over the Istanbul airport (it's really big) and every sleeping pod was booked, every lounge chair was taken, so I ended up sleeping on the floor. Then over 24 hours later, I was back in my own bed in New Zealand.

I had previously been to Italy and Croatia with my family so I was generally aware of the tourism culture in Europe. There was at no point during the entire trip did I feel unsafe, in fact the most unsafe I felt was walking in downtown LA. I tried booking private rooms whenever I could. I did go out almost every night to experienced the nightlife...and was mostly let in. I met a ton of amazing people on walking tours and in the hostels, I also met up with a couple of friends in each city. All in all, it was a great time and I will definitely be back.",2025-04-15 13:20:57,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,3,7,,0.56,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jzrq7x/solo_travelling_europe_at_16/,Public-Guest7512
1jzbus5,reddit,Is my Inca Rail itinerary too risky for a same-day Machu Picchu entry?,"Hi everyone,

I bought an all-inclusive Inca Rail ticket for June (Sunday) and didn't think much of it, assuming they'd only sell a safe itinerary. Here's the schedule:

09:55 — Depart Cusco by bus

12:00 — Arrive at train station

12:30 — Train departs

14:00 — Bus to Citadel (I heard queues are shorter around this time)

14:40 — Arrive at Machu Picchu

15:00 — My entry time (20 min buffer)


Inca Rail assured me it’s fine, and mentioned there’s actually a 40-minute grace period for late entry. Still, I’ve seen reviews where the train was delayed by hours — and that makes me nervous.

I’m thinking of switching to an earlier train at 08:30, but:   
- I’m traveling with a senior, and the extra 1.5h helps them rest (especially with other tiring days ahead)
- The 08:30 train is lower class — refund and change would be a hassle
- I’ll miss the better food and comfort of the nicer train
- I’d rather avoid dealing with bureaucracy unless absolutely necessary


We also don’t want to do a two-day trip, so going the day before isn’t an option.

In short: I prefer to keep my current plan, but I’m worried it’s cutting it too close. Has anyone had issues with delays on this route?

Thanks!

1jz8a3r,reddit,2 week trip in April to Poland: Help deciding which cities (and in what order) should I visit?,"Hi all,
First time heading to Poland, 2 weeks total! My beginning city will be Warsaw and then my end city will be Krakow. I already booked the flights and can’t change it. But beyond the end points, the rest hasn’t been decided yet. But I have two weeks to see a few unique cities and would love to get some advice as to which cities to choose. 

I was thinking Warsaw -> Gdansk -> Wroclaw -> Krakow? Open to less or more or different ones, so long as Warsaw is the beginning and Krakow is the end.

Some things about how I like to travel:
- I’m usually a “wing it” type of traveler but I do want a general idea of which cities to visit. As far as how long I stay in each city, I base it according to how I feel!
- Will be solo and will be carrying city clothes/shoes (this is just part of a longer European trip). Prefer the party hostels.
- I do love nature but due to lack of proper shoes, it would have to be more of a stroll
- I like artsy stuff, thrifting, morbid museums, local food, places that don’t emit too much of a “Disneyland for tourists” vibe
- Will do some touristy stuff but don’t care to visit EVERY single museum or attraction
- Prefer a slower pace travel. Am okay with staying 4-5 days in a city as long as there’s nice places to stroll around and to just sit and people watch. Beautiful greenery/scenic views are a plus.
- will be traveling within the country via train

- **DAY 1**: ARRIVE airport 9:50am. PRAGA - Old town walk around (Astronomical Clock, Stone Lamb house of astronomer Hájek, Hanging Freud, Bethlehem Chapel, tomb of astronomer Tycho Brahe, Mozart house, Café Louvre, etc.), Praga Bunker tour (14:45-17:15). *Sleep Praga station area*

- **DAY 2**: Start early, Hrubá Skála walk, maybe Prachov Cliffs. -- Still figuring out how to do this day trip by public transport. After, head up to Hřensko. *Sleep Hřensko*

- **DAYS 3-4**: Bohemian Switzerland National Park: Děčín, Hřensko, Pravčická Archway, boat ride, Neurathen Castle... Haven't decided on exact trails yet, but I think a couple days would be good. Return to Praga day 4, Plague Tour starts at 20h, sleep old town.

- **DAY 5**: Early train to Karlštejn. Walk around town. Start tour at the castle 10am. Return to Praga after, National Museum if time, opera/classical concert (Dvořák or Figaro, depends on schedule) starts 19h. *Sleep Praga old town*

- **DAYS 6-7**: Karlovy Vary area, Loket Castle, maybe Marianske Lazne, Národní přírodní rezervace SOOS and/or Cheb. *Sleep Karlovy Vary*

- **DAY 8**: PRAGA - Early morning return to Prague. Be at National Technical Museum at opening time, full day in the museum (probably won't take more than a few hours but it's a priority of my trip due to the large astronomy exhibit, so want to give it breathing room; I went to the Tech museum in Berlin which is very similar and regretted not spending more time there). Afternoon: Speculum Alchemiae if I feel like it, Jewish Cemetery, walk around. Medieval Underground Tour begins 18:45h. *Sleep castle area*

- **DAY 9**: Nový Svět, Tycho Brahe & Kepler statue, Kafka house, Golden Lane, see castle from outside. Whatever I have time for. Flight leaves at 15:15h.

I know I've split my Prague days up. This is because I generally don't like cities much and I'm pretty sure I'll go a bit mad if I'm in Prague too many days/nights in a row, and this way I can try sleeping in a few different areas too.

1jwvhrq,reddit,Flight Protection?,"I'm sure this question has been asked many times here, but I'm asking this for my girlfriend. I just bought the cheapest flight ticket i could find for her going from Hong Kong to Minnesota. I'm wondering whether flight protection is even worth it. We have no intentions on canceling or changing the flight at all. She is still young and has no serious medical conditions. Even if any of her flights are delayed, most airlines will try to avoid the time threshold the policy requires for any reimbursement. It seems that most people who get flight protection are those who have medical concerns, travel a lot, or are really worried about extreme delays and other unlikely events. I have friends who travel (domestically and internationally) often and say they always deny any insurance and have had no problems with their trips. I guess protection is really meant for worst case scenarios, or if you're not someone who doesn't have health concerns and doesn't travel often, or if you are someone who wants the extra peace of mind?

I of course would like my girlfriend to be safe, as well as my money, but I can't imagine anything other than extreme cases that would really necessitate getting insurance for a flight. I'd like to hear different opinions on this topic.

1juxrl9,reddit,Where to go in southern Mexico?,"Hello everyone 

It might sound counterintuitive but I'm a Mexican guy asking to foreigners about places in Mexico to visit but I have some days off and I want to solo travel somewhere near in the south. I'm not well traveled specially not solo, so I want to hear your recommendations for the South of Mexico. 

I'm looking for a place I can get to in a day by plane or bus, (I'm located I'm in the state of Tabasco), a place with vibrant nightlife with people from different countries. I'm more into house/dance music, so having places where I could dance to it would be nice. I'm not really into cultural stuff, I've seen them tons of time since I was a kid, so I'm looking more to connect with people.

Places that come into my mind are san Cristobal de las casas, but I already went there like two months ago, PDC or Tulum also come into my mind but I don't know how easy is to meet people there, it seems like many people go there in groups of friends not really looking to meet people so I wouldn't like to spend a small fortune to go sit in a beach listening to music and watching memes. Oaxaca is another place that comes to my mind but I've never gone there so I don't know what to expect, the same with Campeche, I know it has some Caribbean like beaches but I've never tourist there and it's not a major tourist spot so I don't know how good of a plan would be. 

I recently went to Rio and I really liked the vibe there, specially in pedra do sal where everybody is drinking in a public space, there's music, people was singing along, and I met a lot of people from many countries specially Argentinians and I would like to re live something similar here in Mexico but I don't really know what could be the closest place to replicate something like that.

1jqtznn,reddit,Puerto Rico travel,"For those traveling from the US it is a simple process to get to and from the island. All you need is a real ID. I would suggest you take a couple hundred in cash as taxi drivers don't always take cash. The streets especially in the towns are poorly marked even if you are comfortable with Spanish. You might want to load the app that converts English/Spanish as many menus are in Spanish. My sister and I stayed in San Juan, but it did not feel to be the safest of places with bars on windows and doors. We got out and walked in our area but felt we had to be back to the apartment before dark.
One of the places we were hoping to see was their Bioluminescent Bay. Unfortunately we got our VRBO in San Juan. The taxi fare to the ferry and back from San Juan would have cost us $190, then take the ferry over to the small island, then an extra $40 from the ferry to the bay. Then you have the cost of the adventure itself at about $150. These glass bottom kayaks are taken out at night and when the water is stirred with your paddles the small sealife glow. The problem was we would take the last ferry off the island back to PR and wouldn't get to the landing until at least 10:30 and it is not well lit and the taxi ride back to San Juan is another 1 1/2 hours. Needless to say we didn't go. However, if I had known that most people book a night or to on Vieques Island first and get a hotel or whatever there and then the next day head off to PR.  
Lastly, old San Juan is beautiful and has a rich history and nice shops. If your taking at trip to Puerto Rico, just stay in the Old San Juan part of town. Trust me it is worth it.

We live in São Paulo, Brazil and are off to a wedding in Lisbon in the summer. We’d been looking at an adventurous journey back via Luanda - a chance to go to Angola and take advantage of being Portuguese speakers.

While messing around on flightconnections.com, however, I’ve spotted that TAAG has reasonable connections to Windhoek - with an option to go on to São Paulo via Johannesburg. Namibia has long been on our list and this is probably the closest we’re going to get.

Would combining both be madness? We’ll have a couple of weeks and I was thinking (perhaps) 4-6 days in Luanda to get a sense of Angola and do an excursion, and then sink the rest of the time into some of the natural beauty of Namibia. We’re not massive adventure tourists.

During the past several years, I’ve been using Google My Maps / Google Maps to plan my travel itineraries and daily activities. I have also seen some other travellers recommending it here on this sub. 

That said, there are some issues/flaws that are very frustrating to me:

- When opening your “My Map” on Google Maps, Google Maps basic features become unavailable, such as seeing location pictures, reviews, etc. I end up having to close Google Maps entirely so I can get out of the “My Maps” section.

- You are unable to make any changes to your maps, apart from enabling or disabling different layers. I generally use layers to plan different days, but would appreciate the option to adjust things on the fly if needed.

- The actual Google My Maps platform on desktop is quite limiting, and outdated.

I have also tried just using Google Maps instead, saving the different places I’d like to visit. A similar thing seems to happen though, and sometimes the places I saved just come up as GPS coordinates on a map instead of the actual place name.

1jov3e3,reddit,Barcelona to Montserrat day trip - your advice on planning and ticketing?,"Hi all,

I'm visiting Montserrat from Barcelona with my mother on Wednesday 9 April and I would really appreciate and benefit from some help planning for the day. So thank you in advance.

For context, we are travelling there on our own by public transport (R5 line and cable car). We plan to visit the Montserrat Monastery (not watching Boy's choir), museum, have lunch, and take the funiculars up/down for the views.

So far, I have seen multiple people suggesting the Trans Montserrat Card/ToT Montserrat Card and we are planning to get the Trans card to cover all core transport and entry to the Monasterry. However, it also says on Barcelona's Turisme's website, that *access to the Black Madonna and basilica is included, no pre-booking required but ticket holders must queue for entry*.

My question here is:

1. As no pre-booking is required, is entry still guaranteed and we can do it anytime of the day? How long should we expect the wait to be?
2. Approximately how long would it take to visit the whole the Monastery, if we are not queuing to see the Black Madonna?
3. Is the Museum worth seeing?
4. . Aware that there will be a lot of groups and tours, what's the best way to plan for the day to avoid the crowd? Should we start with the funiculars and get the views early then visit the Monasterry after 2:30/3:00pm assuming it will be a little less crowded as the groups start to leave?
5. Finally, do you have any suggestions of decent restaurants/coffee shops at Montserrat?

I would much prefer to hike at Lake Skadar to see it from above but so far I haven't found any tours that bring us up instead of just boating on the lake. Any advice regarding how to get to these places, and would it be safe to do them by myself? Otherwise, would anyone have any recommendations for tours?

1jlzww0,reddit,Should I stay longer in Berlin or go to Dresden?,"Hi all, I'll be in Berlin from May 18-30 for a Maymester. I will then be making my way to Vienna for a summer semester. I'm planning on stopping by Prague and Cesky Krumlov (it's 10 days between Berlin and Vienna). My question is, before I head to Prague, should I stay in Berlin or go to Dresden? I know I'm in Berlin for 2 weeks, but not really since on the weekend of May 24-26, I'm planning on going to Ibiza with a friend, and during most of the day, I will be doing class activities (many of them include museums that I would go to anyways).

My question is, should I stay in Berlin (May 31-June 3) or go to Dresden? I'm worried I'll be tired from moving around a lot, and also, I'm not spending a TON of time in Berlin, but I might be missing out on Dresden if I don't visit. Is it worth the visit? Or should I just stay in Berlin for the extra days?

Looking at budgeting/pricing, they both seem to be about the same price in terms of hotels (at least the ones I'm looking at) and public transport.

1k6wt57,reddit,Itinerary guidance for a month in the Stans!,"Hi there, I’m planning a trip to Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan from the UK with a friend and looking for guidance on our itinerary/ tips for travel. We will be arriving in Bishkek in mid-August and have exactly 4 weeks to travel (28 days). We are active people and actively looking to spend time in nature and with nomads at homestays but mixed with some city visits.  
  
The current basic idea is as follows, but we appreciate any recommendations surrounding places to add/ remove, transport options between remote spots, tips for hiking or local homestays etc.  
  
Arrive to Bishkek – Ala Archa – Suusamyr Valley – Toktogul Reservoir – Tashkent – Samarkand – Panjakent? – Fann Mountains/ 7 Lakes – Dushanbe – Fly to Almaty (rent a car there) – Cholpon Ata – stopoff at Skazka canyon – Karakol for hike to Ala-kul – Saty for Charyn Canyon – Altyn Emel? – Almaty for flight back  
  
We would also ideally like to do a trip to Afghanistan potentially before our flight from Dushanbe but unsure on best way to organise. Would our best bet be to go to mazar-i-sharif overland granted we get visas? Lots of recommendations surrounding going with a tour guide, is this still best practice?  
  
Unfortunately, with this itinerary we miss the Pamir mountains + highway but on a shortish time schedule and a large distance, we would rather fly to explore Issyk kul lake surroundings.

I'm attaching my itinerary for a 7 day trip to Tanzania in June. You can see the different places we'll be going each day and the places we'll be staying. 
I'm having doubts about it because I think we'll be doing more travelling from place to place rather than just out taking our time searching for animals - I've seen this online as well.  
Should I add an extra day in one place and remove somewhere else? Just looking for any recommendations on what would make it the best trip for us. Starting to stress about this!

1k62f5b,reddit,Advice for getting to Cusco Peru (Machu Picchu),"Hello, I am planning a trip with my wife to hike the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu. The trip starts in Cusco Peru, so we are trying to figure out the best/cheapest way to get there. We are traveling from the U.S. and looking to fly into Lima (round trip), then take a second flight (separate round trip ticket) from Lima to Cusco. We are doing this because it will save us about $200 per ticket. Our flight lands in Lima at 8:20PM. Flights from Lima to Cusco leave just about every hour, so I am debating if it would be a good idea to just buy a ticket at the gate once we get through customs in Lima. Looking at Google, flights for today/tomorrow look to be only a few dollars more (but also not in a high tourism month).

Option 2: Should I do the normal thing and book the second flight 3 hours after we are scheduled to land in Lima (11:30PM). Obviously, this would not protect us if our flight is delayed for any reason, and on the other hand, if we fly through customs, it would be a bummer to wait and get into Cusco super late, about 1AM. 

Just wondering if anyone has done this before, if it worked out, or if they regretted it. Thanks in advance!",2025-04-23 15:44:24,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,3,20,,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k62f5b/advice_for_getting_to_cusco_peru_machu_picchu/,Architect_Mitch

1k5sq1r,reddit,Itinerary check: 22 days in Japan for first-timers,"Hi everyone! On July 2nd I will fly with my girlfriend from the Netherlands to Japan for our very first time. It has always been a dream to visit and it is finally coming true. We have made an itinerary. Our stays are fixed already, but within those stays we can still scrap, change, and move. Any suggestions are most welcome, for instance: the many train discount options currently have me a bit confused, or: which days do you see as (too) intensive or very intensive? We get it's hot and humid in July, but since I'm a teacher (and bound to school holidays), we had little other options.

We are happy with seeing our main highlights. I get places like Tokyo and Kyoto will be marvellous and each deserve a month, but we are happy with seeing the main highlights right now and coming back for a quieter trip next time. We love the traditional areas of Japan, its architecture, we love food, and combining a bit of souvenir hunting and shopping. Thank you very much for any help in advance!

***July 3 - Day 1: Arrival in Osaka***  
Late arrival at Osaka Airport (KIX) around 20:30. We will stay in the Shinsaibashi area, quite close to Dotonbori. We'll probably enter our hotels, exhausted, so it sounds like a great chance to get to know the Japanese konbini and tuck in early.

***July 4-5 - Days 2-3: Osaka***  
These two days will be fully dedicated to Osaka and can be swapped either way. Most likely on **Day 2** we will visit Osaka Castle. Since it will be our first day in Japan, we are happy to just straddle along Osaka's streets, pick up something to eat wherever we go, and perhaps buy a small souvenir.

On **Day 3** we might just stay close to our hotel: with Dotonbori, all the shopping streets, Kuromon Ichiba market and if we have time, we might fit a visit to the Lion shrine into this day. It will mainly be about the culinary highlights.

***July 6-9 - Days 4-7: Kyoto***  
We would like to spend more time in Kyoto for its traditional areas. We will stay near Karasuma Station. My girlfriend really likes matcha, so I suppose we will also look around to find many matcha-related things! There isn't necessarily an order to these days, we can swap them around.

On **Day 4** we will focus on the eastern part of the city. I am really eager to get to know the spectacular views of Ninenzaka and Sannenzaka. These are the views I have dreamt of seeing as a child, so I am eager to get up very early to get to walk there while it is still (relatively) quiet. We will take our time here, and visit nearby sites such as the pagoda, Kiyomizu-dera, Yasaka shrine and the Gion area.

On **Day 5** we plan to visit Fushimi Inari early. Upon return, we might go to the Nishiki market.

On **Day 6** we will visit the Arashiyama Bamboo forest, followed by the Golden Pavilion.

**Day 7** will be a day trip to Nara. My girlfriend really wants to meet the deer, so we'll do a round-trip to Nara. We might also visit Todai-ji if we have the time.

***July 10-11 - Days 8-9: Hiroshima***  
We will leave Kyoto early on 10 July to head to Hiroshima in the shinkansen. It will be a relatively brief visit, but sufficient to get to know the two major highlights we really want to see. We will be staying near the Hiroshima JR Station so it'll be easy to get on the move on 12 July.

On **Day 8** we plan an early arrival in Hiroshima to leave our luggage and head into the city. For now the major highlight we want to see this day is the Hiroshima Peace Monument. If time allows it, we will also visit Hiroshima castle.

**Day 9** will be about a visit to Miyajima. We will make this a laid-back day. We mainly want to see the world-famous torii and the Itsukushima shrine. We might also use this day to change our city-filled itinerary with some nature.

***July 12-14 - Days 10-12: Seoul (K)***  
Instead of taking a shinkansen all the way up to Tokyo, we have decided to take a 1h50 flight to Seoul and get a small taste of South Korea. Our flight leaves at 10:30 AM. We will mainly see the traditional old town, some palaces, and grab some Korean souvenirs and food.

***July 15-19 - Days 13-17: Tokyo***  
Tokyo is one of the main highlights of our trip. We've got some major highlights we want to visit, both inside and outside of Tokyo. The days below, except for Day 13, are interchangeable. Since we want to visit Mt. Fuji for a day trip even though it is not the best period, we might save it for the best day and visit it spontaneously and early on that day according to the forecasts.

On **Day 13** we expect to land at Narita Airport around 15:30. Since it might take a while to move into the city, we plan to drop off our luggage and make the most of our evening. We will be staying close to Asakusa Station (slightly south of it), so we might pay a visit to Senso-ji and find a nice restaurant in the area.

On **Day 14** we will visit the Akihabara area. As a child who grew up with lots of Pokemon, Mario, and Nintendo, I intend to find my inner child once again. Depending on how the day goes, we might also visit the Tokyo Tower this day.

For **Day 15** we will plan a day trip to Mt. Fuji. The view from Chureito Pagoda fascinates us, so we both are very much wanting to visit the Mt. Fuji area this day. We are still doubting whether to take an organised trip which takes us along all the highlights or travel (very) early by ourselves to beat the crowds. We might also hire some bikes to cycle along the Kawaguchi Lake and visit famous viewpoints, such as the Lawson konbini. At the end of the day, we will head back to our hotel in Tokyo.

On **Day 16** we will visit the Shibuya Crossing. I suppose it's maybe a sight for about an hour, finding some nice viewpoints, so afterwards we will explore the Shibuya area a bit more. As dog lovers, we also want to see the Hachiko statue, in honour of our loyal friends who sadly aren't with us anymore. If time allows it, we will also visit the Meiji shrine on this day.

For **Day 17** we are still divided between a day trip to Nikko or sticking around and discovering Shinjuku. Unless someone has a strong suggestion, I think we will decide this on the go.

***July 20-21 - Days 18-19: Takayama***  
Getting to know the traditional Japan with its typical architecture has a great pull on us. Therefore, we intend to cross the Japanese alps and get a glimpse of the atmosphere in some of its beautiful places.

On **Day 18** we plan to leave Tokyo early since the trip to Takayama will be long. We intend to spend the day getting to know the town with its traditional streets, enjoying some food and taking some nice pictures in its historical centre. If we are on time, we might just drop off our luggage and visit the morning markets.

**Day 19** will also be spent in Takayama. Possibly we might also plan (half) a day trip to Shirakawago here. Our main doubt is whether to plan the Shirakawago trip during our stay in Takayama on this day, doing it on the move towards Kanazawa the next day, or using a day in Kanazawa to backtrack to Shirakawago. What would you do?

***July 22-23 - Days 20-21: Kanazawa***  
Kanazawa is a further opportunity to get to know the more traditional and perhaps slightly less touristy areas. Main interests are the Higashi Chaya district and the Nagamachi district, along with Kanazawa castle. We will be staying in a centric area in the Musashimachi area, near the JR Station. As said previously, we are doubting whether to spend one of these days in Shirakawago or not.

**Day 20:** we plan to leave Takayama early and possibly stop in Shirakawago. If we visit Shirawakago in the morning, we might drop off our luggage at the hotel in the afternoon instead and visit Kanazawa castle for this day. In that case, **Day 21** will be spent visiting the historical neighbourhoods mentioned previously and Myouryuji.

***July 24 - Day 22: Back to Osaka***  
On this day we will be travelling back from Kanazawa to Osaka. Our hotel is close to the airport, so we might decide to drop off our luggage in a centric area, maybe make the most of enjoying Japanese street food one more time, buy some additional souvenirs and visit the Glico sign once again, before heading back to the hotel and tuck in early.

***July 25 - Day 23: Back home***  
Sadly, all good things come to an end. Our plane leaves at 9:30 AM. Fortunately we will be close to the airport, so the commute will be very small. On the way back, hopefully, we will have a great journey to look back upon.",2025-04-23 06:48:28,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,3,12,,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k5sq1r/itinerary_check_22_days_in_japan_for_firsttimers/,Alo1702

1k3e9mv,reddit,Iberia Luggage Woes?,"tldr: Upcoming international flight with Iberia and worried about them losing my luggage, am I overthinking things? 

I have an upcoming trip with an Iberia flight from Chicago to Portugal, with a layover in Madrid, and I’m getting nervous. I’m generally not a nervous flyer, but I’ve never flown with Iberia before and have recently heard they’re famous for the amount of luggage they lose, especially when there’s a MAD layover. Based on LuggageLosers, they’re almost always in the top 5 (if not #1) in terms of baggage lost.

I do have to check a bag and although I definitely plan to stick an AirTag in there, I keep stressing about the likelihood of them losing my bag and everything inside! It also sounds like it’s incredibly difficult to get them to actually reunite you with your bag even with the location sharing, and in all honesty I would rather not spend my vacation constantly on the phone trying to explain the situation to their CS agents. 

Any reassurance or recommendations to help stop me from stressing over this? Should I just expect them to lose my bag and be happy when they don’t?

I live in the Washington DC area. I’m excited to be invited on a Trip to Italy for Refugio hiking in the Dolomites July 15-19. 

I want to arrive early to get over jet lag before hiking. 

I have an option to go to London on July 12 but I think it might be better for me to go directly to Italy. 

Time is my biggest constraint. I love wildflowers and have never been to Europe in summer!!

Edit to say I would consider more hostels or refugios!!! And that I am trying to use buses and not get a rental car if possible. 

Where can I go in Italy that will be restful before the hiking? I prefer do day walks or swimming or take a gondola to see wildflowers. 

Also posting on travel Italy community. 

EDITS: July 15-19 exact location: Alta Via della Marmotta begins in San Vito di Cadore and ends in Auronzo di Cadore. Both towns are close to Cortina d'Ampezzo, a renowned destination in the Dolomites and a good base for exploring the region.

1k2owe6,reddit,Advice for Borneo / Orangutans,"My girlfriend and I are going to Borneo in mid-May. But we are having trouble trying to decide how to best spend a few day, focused on seeing orangutans.

We are starting in Kuala Lumpur on Sunday and need to be in Kota Kinabalu by Friday at noon for a 3D2N Mount Kinabalu (dates are fixed and can’t be changed). So we have 4–5 nights to work with beforehand.

While we booked a 3N orangutan river cruise in Tanjung Puting (Indonesia with Orangutan Days) the logistics are starting to make me question if this is the best use of time, as we would need to:

* Fly KUL–CGK (Sunday) Overnight in Jakarta
* Fly CGK–PKN (Monday)
* PKN–CGK (Thursday), followed by CGK–BKI 
* However, the nonstop CGK-BKI was just canceled by AirAsia so now it would be CGK–KUL–BKI

So now we’re considering skipping Indonesia altogether and staying within Malaysian Borneo. 

Have been looking at either the Kinabatangan Wetlands Resort or Sukau Rainforest Lodge since we can fly direct KUL-SDK and then SDK-BKI. Considering 2N or 3N options there. 

I’m also intrigued by Borneo Rainforest Lodge, although it’s very expensive and might be tough to squeeze in time-wise between Sunday and Thursday.

Wondering what advice people have here

1. Should we stick to the original plan even though it's requires 5 flights? We were excited about the boat journey
2. How does Kinabatangan compare? Thoughts between the two resorts?
3. Is it worth the effort/expense to try to make Danum Valley work? Can we do both this and Kinabatangan in this time window?

**Days 1 - 3** - **Dublin** (3 nights)
> * Arrival at noon / Half-day + 1 Full day to explore
> * 1 Day trip: *Belfast* (2 hours each way) OR *Cliffs of Moher* (3 hours each way)

**Days 4 - 7**: **Amsterdam** (4 nights) - *Flight from Dublin*
> * Half-day + 2 Full days to explore (Jordaan District, Rotterdam, Utrecht, etc). Spending my birthday here.
> * 1 Day trip: *Delft* or *Haarlem*

**Day 8 - 10**: **Brussels** (3 nights) - *Train from Amsterdam*
> * Half Day + Full day to explore
> * 1 Day trip: *Bruges* or *Ghent* or *Antwerp*

**Days 11 - 13**: **Paris** (3 nights) - *Train from Brussels*
> * Half Day + 2 Full days to explore

**Day 14** - **Return to Dublin** (1 night) - *Flight from Paris*
> * Half Day

**Day 15** - **Departure**

1k17tkn,reddit,Why nobody is going to Java? (Also please help with travel plans),"Hello everyone!

I'm trying to plan a trip to Java for two weeks (Apr 27 — May 11). After some research it seems 95% of travelers in Java are domestic tourists, and the other 5% are people going on tours from Bali for a couple of days.

Why are there so few independent international travelers in Java? Am I missing smth or is it just undiscovered yet?

Some context: I'm a female solo traveller and I'm white so my main concern is safety and just being comfortable — I don't enjoy standing out too much.

First version of my itinerary looked like this:

Yogyakarta (4 nights) (flying in)  
Dieng Plateau (6 nights)  
Yogyakarta (1 night)  
Train from Yogyakarta to Probolinggo, then transfer to Cemoro Lawang  
Cemoro Lawang (3 nights)  
Transfer from Cemoro Lawang to Surabaya (to fly out)

I'm mostly interested in nature, the island seems out of this world with all the volcanoes and waterfalls. I thought i could stay in Dieng and do some hiking, maybe rent a scooter and explore.

Now I'm thinking of skipping the Dieng Plateau because it looks too remote and it seems not many international travellers go there. Should this be a concern?

Should I go to Malang and/or Banyuwangi instead?

I've been planning to use public transportation (trains, buses) to get around. I can also drive a scooter if the traffic is not too crazy. Not a fan of group tours but it looks like there aren't many other budget-friendly options for some attractions such as Ijen.

Please help me figure this out. Any advice will be appreciated.

P.S. One more question: how big are the Labour Day celebrations? Should I be worried about hotels/tickets because of increase in travel during the holidays?

EDIT: I understand that popular places such as Jogja, Bromo, Ijen see a lot of international tourists. My main concern is with less popular areas. 

My understanding of Java being somewhat under the radar comes from research: there is little popular travel content about the island on Youtube etc. ",2025-04-17 08:28:08,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,3,44,,0.57,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k17tkn/why_nobody_is_going_to_java_also_please_help_with/,ilyazd

I’m a Moroccan passport holder flying soon from Casablanca to Bangkok with a layover in Beijing (under 24 hours).  
I plan to use the 24-hour visa-free transit (TWOV) policy in China, which I know applies to Moroccan citizens. I already have a confirmed onward ticket from Beijing to Bangkok, but the problem is:

\-And I won’t have the boarding pass for the Beijing–Bangkok flight when I check in at Casablanca

I’ve heard that in such cases, Chinese immigration may allow a temporary entry permit to collect luggage and re-check for the onward flight.

My concern is this: Will I be blocked at the Casablanca airport check-in desk if I don’t have a Chinese visa and I’m transiting on separate tickets?

Have any other nationalities faced issues with this kind of setup — like being asked for a visa or denied boarding at their origin airport (especially with separate tickets)?

1jzewyr,reddit,"2-week itinerary for Germany, Czechia, Austria & Switzerland – too much?","Hi everyone! I’m planning a two-week trip through Germany, Czechia, Austria, and Switzerland in late September and would really appreciate any advice or suggestions. We’re a group of four young guys (late 20s), all pretty easygoing and looking for a good mix of culture, sights, food, beer, and fun. Definitely want some nightlife here and there, but also enjoy spending time in nature and just generally soaking up the atmosphere in new places.

To give a bit of context: the trip is centered around two major events: I'll be in Berlin to support a friend running the marathon (Sept 21), and then heading to Munich for Oktoberfest (Sept 25–27). Beyond those two fixed points, we’re still figuring out the rest of the route and wondering if we’re squeezing too much in or missing any gems.

Here’s the rough plan so far:

**Sept 19–22: Berlin**  
Arrival. Planning to stay a few days to explore the city and cheer on my friend in the Berlin Marathon. No set itinerary yet for Berlin, so open to ideas!

**Sept 22–25: Prague**  
We’ll head to Prague for a couple of days. Again, nothing really planned yet.

**Sept 25–27: Munich**  
Back to Germany for Oktoberfest. We’ve already got accommodations sorted here.

**Sept 28–Oct 3: ??**  
This is where things are still flexible. We were thinking about doing something like:

* Salzburg for a night or two (it’s so close to Munich, seems like a no-brainer)
* Then maybe head to Innsbruck, and finally Lucerne to end the trip
* We’d fly out of Frankfurt on Oct 3, so we’d need to factor in travel time back there

My main question: does this feel too rushed? We want to see a good mix of cities and scenic spots, but also don’t want to spend half the trip on trains or feeling burnt out. Also curious if anyone has suggestions for places we might be overlooking (or that aren’t worth the time).

1jz4n68,reddit,Some questions about train systems on Spain,"¡Hola! 

I have a question about how Spain's train system works. I bought a RENFE ALVO train ticket for April 21st from Barcelona to Seville through the RENFE website. I have a few questions: 

1) When buying a ticket, I wrote my passport number in the option where the ID number was requested (I am Turkish, I wrote my Turkish passport number.) but the ""nationality"" option did not appear. Is there such an option or is it enough to just write my passport number as it is? 

2) Is there a place, person, kiosk etc. at Barcelona Sants Station where I need to validate my ticket or is it enough to just get on the train? 

3) The ticket came to me in PDF format. I printed that ticket in black and white. Will printing it without color cause problems when I am asked for my ticket?

4) Also the trains route will be Barcelona - Madrid then Madrid - Seville. How is the train change in Madrid train station?",2025-04-14 17:29:39,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,3,8,,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jz4n68/some_questions_about_train_systems_on_spain/,According_Gene_5269

- not more than 2 hours from an airport
- strong food culture
- sleepy and slow town where there’s not much to do but lay around and eat

1jyikm5,reddit,Lisbon/Cascais/Sintra trip- does it make sense to make Cascais our home base?,"Planning a trip to Portugal in June. We have 9 days in the country. The three major parts we want to see are Sintra (day trip), Cascais, and Lisbon. We want the flexibility in our trip to be able to spend time relaxing at pools/beaches, while also seeing the major city. Because of this, we are contemplating making Cascais our home base and choosing a nice resort to stay in that area, and traveling to Sintra/Lisbon from there. 

We’d want to do 2-3 days in Lisbon, a day in Sintra, and the rest of the time in Cascais, mainly because it seems central to all spots and we can relax a bit. It also gives us flexibility if we do decide we want to relax one day, we’re not stuck in such a city atmosphere. Does it make sense to stay at a resort in Cascais the whole time, or would you say it’s necessary to spend a couple nights in a hotel in Lisbon? From what I can tell, the train from Cascais to Lisbon is about 45 minutes, so I don’t think it would be a problem to do this a couple of separate times. The bus from Cascais to Sintra looks to be about 25 minutes.

Also, what hotels/resorts would you recommend?

Unfortunately, I’ll need to have a surgery consultation, so I have to travel to France. I’ll be staying there between June 19–24. The consultation will be in Montpellier, and my girlfriend and I will arrive by plane in Marseille.

Since I’ll be spending a few days there anyway, I’d like to see some beautiful places. I’m not sure how warm the sea is around that time, but it would be great to go for a swim since we’ll be near the coast.

So I was thinking of spending June 19–22 in either Nice or Cannes.

Nice seems like a much more interesting city, but based on videos, the sea looks like it has strong currents. I’m not sure if it’s suitable for swimming.  
Cannes has a beautiful beach, but apparently there are few public areas and the city itself is a bit boring.

1jvuory,reddit,2 weeks Nicaragua vs. Mexico City & Oaxaca,"Hi!  
I'm a 20s Male, and got roughly 2 weeks I want to spend in Central America in the 2nd half of July (2nd half), as a solo backpacker.  
I'm conflicted between doing Nicaragua (maybe combined with a few days in El Salvador), vs. Mexico City + Oaxaca. Will be flying from and to Boston.  
For Nicaragua, I was eyeing Leon, San Juan del Sur, Granada, Masaya, Ometepe and Corn Island (weather-permitting). For CDMX and Oaxaca, I suppose around 1 week in each is a good amount, but haven't done any research yet, so I'm open to any suggestions of nearby towns to stay at/visit as well.

Nicaragua is definitely cheaper and better for my budget (including the flights) and might have a more chill backpacker vibe to it, but the food and culture/history part seem to be better in Central/Pacific Mexico. I understand there is a festival in Oaxaca during July (Guelaguetza) so it might be a bit too crowded but could also be fun, and the food in this region is a big draw. I'm guessing safety is rather similar between the two.

I've already been to Central America (Costa Rica, Caribbean Mexico, Belize, Guatemala (just Tikal tho) and Cuba) and also South America (Peru, Colombia), I can speak Spanish, and my interests are hiking, food, culture (temples, ruins), more food, nature and meeting other ppl/locals (so if there are other backpackers as well it's definitely a bonus), and am a pretty fast-paced traveler. Not too much into museums (history is fine), and I don't surf if that makes any difference.

1jug23h,reddit,Travel with medication (to China and in general),"Dear all,

in my family, each of us must take medication for personal use. Altogether we have about 10 different ones. I am always worried that this may cause problems when travelling to other countries. Next trip: probably China.

We all know that it differs from country to country what is considered a normal medication, controlled substance, or illegal drug. What can be a a normal medication in one place could in the worst case be illegal in another. Especially when it comes to regions that are known for hard drug laws I am worried. I've read reports of people sent to jail (or worse) for carrying painkillers, e.g. in Egypt. I didn't yet read it about China, but it is known for hard drug laws.

How do you handle this? Can the embassy certify in advance that you are allowed to bring it?

Obviously, I am googling. But I find the default answer ""bring your doctor's prescription"" unsatisfying. If a substance is illegal, a letter written by someone (a stranger to the customs) from the other side of the world will hardly change that. If a doctors prescribes you marihuana, it will still be illegal in those countries. As a laymen I know this about marihuana - but how should I know which of the long list of medical incredients (many of which with multiple names) could also be problematic?

I am going from LAX to MEX and am not familiar with the quality of the airlines options. The first choice is a flight with United.

Cons: both trips require a 2 hour layover making it a 6 hour total flight both ways with plane swaps. Also, this flight time is not ideal with an early departure at 0500. The next option is Volaris. The Pros: it is a direct flight at a convenient time for me. Cons: I've heard rumors that the quality of the airline is subpar, and that the trips are sometimes cancelled at the last minute. The pricing for this flight is $307 on a website called ""Kiwi"" that I haven't heard of. If anyone could share their experience with this airline or the booking website? Also, there is no carry-on option. The third option is AeroMexico. Pros: Its a direct flight at a very convenient time for me. Also, one carry-on bag is included. Cons: This is the most expensive option at $410, although there is an option for $382 on a website called ""eDreams"" but once again I question the legitimacy.

1jrjuah,reddit,"Buenos Aires, Iguazú Falls, Rio","Hi everyone! My husband is turning 30 this September.

We want to celebrate by going somewhere fun he doesn’t need a visa for (he’s Ecuadorian). I was thinking of doing Buenos Aires, Iguazú falls and then Rio. We’ve both been to Rio before so we’ll probably skip Christ the Redeemer and possibly Sugarloaf mountain (unless he really wants to do the helicopter ride) and just chill in Ipanema. He loves a beach vacation. 

We’ve never done Buenos Aires so we want to do 3 full days there, 2 days at the falls, and then 3-4 full days in a Rio. We want to fly Buenos Aires to the Argentinian side of the falls and fly out to Rio from the Brazilian side. 

Would you adjust the time? Do you have any recs? Has anyone done a similar itinerary with tips?! Appreciate it! ",2025-04-04 19:04:35,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,3,9,,0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jrjuah/buenos_aires_iguazú_falls_rio/,Special-Beach9735

1jpoync,reddit,Take the Amtrak or drive to NY?,"Hello, I’d just like a few opinions on if me and my friend should take the train to New York or just drive. We’re roughly 6 hours away by car, the train would take about 13 hours with the stops and layover it has on its route. 

For both of us using the cheapest option for seats, it comes to around $380 since we are taking two connecting trains. I know people say this can be cheaper due to gas and parking expenses, however we are planning on staying in New Jersey and would not be driving into the city, instead taking an Uber or another transportation system. 

Part of me feels like it would be cheaper to drive, but I’ve never been on the Amtrak before and thought it would be a fun idea, but I don’t it to turn into something super expensive. I enjoy driving, but after 3 hours I personally start to get antsy lol. I wanted some opinions on if you were in my situation if you would rather drive or take the train. Thank you for any help!!

EDIT: Thank you all for your suggestions and opinions! I honestly appreciate that a ton of people gave me lots of ideas and things to consider.

I completely forgot to mention in my post, but we are going to see a concert and it estimates on amtrak that we’d get there around 1-2 hours before the concert starts. 

Some people have said there can be delays with the train, so I’m now considering flying instead to not deal with the potential of missing it. If the ride was shorter and I wasn’t needing to be somewhere at a certain time, I’d probably take it, but I don’t want to risk it lol.

Again, I appreciate all the responses and suggestions I didn’t even think about! One day I’ll take the train, but I may this time for the trip lol",2025-04-02 13:47:29,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,4,50,,0.83,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jpoync/take_the_amtrak_or_drive_to_ny/,livyIabufanda

I'm planning a trip to Africa to visit safari. This is only my second solo trip and first one was Japan so a bit different planning. I would like to go in second half of October and want to start planning to calculate costs and see if i can even afford it. From what i see safari became extremely expensive and i dont have a lot of savings. Most people are suggesting Botswana or Kenya but from what i've read on reddit people claim that Kenya is a cheaper option. How much can i expect for 5 or 7 day safari to cost. I'm talking cheapest option possible. For 1 person, backpacker. I dont care where i sleep, dont want expensive hotels, all inclusive or anything like that. I just want to travel through wilderness and national parks, see as many animals as possible and check a city or two. Can you point me to some safary agencies, or give me tips and advice for planning the trip, what to see and where to stay. I would like to mention that i have the option to travel with agency, the trip is 13 days and costs about 1700€ + attractions(about 1000€) and includes 1 day of safari. But i prefer to travel alone and organise trip according to my interests.

The trip with agency includes Nairobi, Masai Mara national park and safari, Kibera, Diani Beach, island Wasini, biking throgh Ukunda, Robinson Island, Mombasa.

I've been doing a ton of research in regards to the requirements for my cat to travel with me, but nothing seems straight forward and I want to be certain I do it right. 

I know that she needs to have the rabies vaccine and be up to date on all other vaccines, but does anyone know if a rabies titre test is required? Or is that just for dogs? Additionally, if I have a layover in Paris, even though my final destination is the US, will she need to be microchipped and have an EU pet passport? I've already reached out to Air France representatives, but their response to me wasn't clear. 

The requirements at my final destination are only that she has record of a rabies vaccine (but no titre) and that she doesn't exhibit any signs of illness. I'm worried about getting caught up in France.

This summer I have a month to see Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Albania. However, I’m having some trouble figuring out the most efficient route that includes all the places I would like to see, and in which order I should see them that causes the least amount of stress. I’m definitely a little worried about bus travel as it would be my first time in the area. 

I’m mostly concerned about getting from Bosnia to Montenegro. The start needs to be in Croatia (Dubrovnik) and I should eventually end up in Northern Albania (Shkoder). 

In Bosnia, I’d like to see Mostar and Sarajevo. In Montenegro, at least Kotor and Bar. I’m willing to add one or two new places for the sake of efficiency, I just don’t know in what itinerary makes the most sense! Anyone else follow a similar itinerary and have any advice?

1jonsbh,reddit,Northern lights?,"I would like to plan a trip for next year, thinking of march to try to see the northern lights. 
I am currently in Fairbanks and unfortunately there’s been a nasty snowstorm while I’m here. There’s a chance I may see them tomorrow but either way I’ve been obsessed with the northern lights for a while and know I am going to want to see them again.

I want to stick with North America as I cannot do long flights. I would prefer not to come back to Fairbanks as I like traveling to new places. Willing to come back to Alaska again though.

My ideal trip would be staying in a hotel that has breakfast and food in the lobby/ or walkable to restaurants. Would like to be able to see the lights from outside my hotel or accommodation. 

I have enjoyed sleeping during the day and staying up all night while I’ve been in Alaska and would be fine staying somewhere without many activities. Preferably somewhere that I would not have to rent a car and could easily get to where I’m staying from the airport.

Also an extra would be somewhere that’s on the cheaper side and easy to get to from Denver, Colorado. 

I have read about a few different places in Canada just wanted to see if anyone has personal experience that might match what I’m looking for.

Thanks in advance!

This is the itinerary I've cooked up, we're not really big city people but everyone says we have to give Tokyo time. We love museums, nature, and learning about different cultures.

I would love to hear your tips, tricks, recommendations, must sees, and criticism on the itinerary itself! If anyone knows of any off the beaten track must see locations I have no problem renting a car and driving there.

Is the itinerary too much? Too many daytrips maybe?

Also, I pulled out 300 000 yen cash because I hear cash is still king in Japan. Do I need more? Or do most places have credit card access? I know small vendors and restaurants probably don't. But this is a fat stack of cash. I hate traveling with a lot of money like this.
