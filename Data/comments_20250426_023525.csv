It reminds me of the Alberta oil boom in a way - where so many didnt invest their earnings. So many lived beyond their means and got blindsided by the oil work fizzling out that they got trapped under debt. This seems to be a big factor in the conservative support out west. Pure anger that is projected into the world - and conservative/republicans campaign on this anger and get people to direct it at the left.

I feel worse for steel industry, as it seemed to be a little more stable. But not being somewhat prepared for emergencies is on the individual.

I wish they would teach financial literacy and budgeting in high schools. It would go a long way.

Ive had to change careers at least twice because of careers that just weren't sustainable.

Layoffs aren't always permanent either. We've known about this pending disaster for a while now, hopefully these people affected managed to make a plan for this moment.

But when you got to vote, and think the conservatives will save you - remember that layoffs are crucial to ensure maximum profits for billionaires and stakeholders.

Literally everyone on *both* sides of the conflict could've told Trump there is no mutually acceptable resolution to this war, as long as both sides are capable of fighting. Putin's actions threw down the gauntlet to the international rules-based world order. You can't break these rules ""half way."" Either our post WW2 system, which *in principle* renounces territorial annexations by force, works, or it doesn't (in which case we will have a cascade of wars all over the world, as every 2-bit dictator tries to re-evaluate past treaties and settle past scores, with only international law stopping them before.)

This is bigger than Ukraine, but they're the ones doing the fighting, and all Trump's actions have and will cause is a lot of dead Ukrainians (and possibly a lot others if and when this war spills over, which is far more likely to happen if Putin wins.)

The Canadian government under Justin Trudeau spent the last 9 years trying to mask weak GDP growth with mass migration..almost entirely driven by arrivals from India (as well as lesser amounts from Pakistan, Middle East, China, Philippines). This was done done in the name of ""economic growth"" but with no regard for housing affordability, strained infrastructure and public services as well as socioeconomic issues. The end result is the lowest GDP per capita in the entire G20 (the UK is not much higher) alongside a doubling of national debt and an ongoing affordability crisis.

Too many politicians are short-term strategists with equal or even less foresight than the general public. If this trade deal in any way allows for easier migration (especially for low-skilled workers) from India to the UK (whether through formal immigration channels or backdoor channels ie. applying for permanent residency while in the UK on a temporary visa) then this deal should be reconsidered or the UK runs the risk of making the same mistakes as what was done here.",2025-04-10 04:17:41,57,SpaceRacketeer,worldnews

mo0t5gz,1k39jqy,reddit,"The deeper you go into these definitions, the closer you are to discovering that gender differences are cultural. Sex differences are biological, but gender is prescribed.

How?

Look, all you need to do is imagine being born with nothing down there. Just a black slate, a bit like a plastic doll. Imagine that there is nothing at birth. In addition to this, imagine that like some turtles, our sex determined just a little bit later during development. Imagine that it gets determined at around 48 months. All the aspects of this imaginary human species are identical.

Do we behave like boys or girls, before we *know*?

Do we treat them as boys or girls before we know?

The cultural indicators and expectations applied to new borns occurs before the child is even born. We have studies supporting this. We *can* alter the gender of a child after birth. We have plenty of case studies about this. The moment we identify a child as sex female we begin projecting gender female norms and expecting gender female behaviour. Same for sex male and gender male. If we didn't know the sex, how would we behave? Think about it.

Sex is biological, and there's three of them. Female, male, neuter. A breeding pair can only be made up between a sex female and a sex male. Any individual who refuses to, or cannot, engage in reproductive sex is, by all intents and purposes, sex neuter. It doesn't matter the details when it's a human because consent is a part of being a person. Neuter, therefore, is as much a biological construct as it is a choice: abstinence, contraceptives, gonad removal, gonad liganding, or simply being naturally infertile, for humans specifically, are the same. Not so for beasts, but humans, yes.

You can choose to be sex neuter! You can choose to no longer be able to be one of a breeding pair. Permanent or temporary, it doesn't matter, you can, and probably do, exercise this choice. Despite having the gonads of sex male or sex female, you can choose to be sex neuter.

Bring it back around, if the infant hasn't yet expressed its sex role, if it's still in development, which means it's sex neuter, what then is the gender?

Now, finally, consider this: infanrs are not able to be pair of a breeding couple. Despite having the perceived sex, the function isn't present until puberty. They are, technically and biologically, at this easily definable moment in time, sex neuter. Even though we know to expect them to later on, post puberty, become authentic, breed able sex M or F. We also know that they can, and probably should, avoid being fertile until they reach an appropriate age, despite the biology of it.

Now that you've been enlightened somewhat, help define what it means to be female at birth. What does this truly mean for humans specifically? How can this not be cultural? How can this not be embedded within time? How can the definition of a breeding pair be applied to humans just as it is applied to beasts?

How can you condone gender as being something you're born with, when your sex, at that moment in time, is neuter?

ml4bcqm,1jq2ws7,reddit,"I've seen this story before.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoot–Hawley\_Tariff\_Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoot–Hawley_Tariff_Act)

Ended with the Great Depression.  I'm not an American, but I think brushing up on that act would probably be a good idea.

>In May 1930, Canada, the most loyal trading partner for the U.S., retaliated by imposing new tariffs on 16 products that accounted altogether for approximately 30% of U.S. exports to Canada.[^(\[19\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoot%E2%80%93Hawley_Tariff_Act#cite_note-19) Later, Canada also forged closer economic links with the [British Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire) via the [British Empire Economic Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire_Economic_Conference) of 1932. France and Britain protested and developed new trade partners. Germany developed a system of trade via clearing. 

>The depression worsened for workers and farmers despite Smoot and Hawley's promises of prosperity from high tariffs; consequently, Hawley lost re-nomination, while Smoot was one of 12 Republican Senators who lost their seats in [the 1932 elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1932_United_States_Senate_elections), with the swing being the largest in Senate history (being equaled in [1958](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1958_United_States_Senate_elections) and [1980](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_United_States_Senate_elections)).[^(\[20\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoot%E2%80%93Hawley_Tariff_Act#cite_note-20) Nations other than Canada that enacted retaliatory tariffs included Cuba, Mexico, France, Italy, Spain, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, and Switzerland.[^(\[4\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoot%E2%80%93Hawley_Tariff_Act#cite_note-:2-4)

...

>Unemployment was 8% in 1930 when the Smoot–Hawley Act was passed but the new law failed to lower it. The rate jumped to 16% in 1931 and to 25% in 1932–1933.[^(\[27\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoot%E2%80%93Hawley_Tariff_Act#cite_note-27) 

...

>The 1932 [Democratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)) campaign platform pledged to lower tariffs. After winning the election, President [Franklin D. Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt) and the now-Democratic Congress passed [Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocal_Trade_Agreements_Act) of 1934. This act allowed the president to negotiate tariff reductions on a bilateral basis and treated such a tariff agreement as regular legislation, requiring only a majority, rather than as a treaty requiring a two-thirds vote. This was one of the core components of the trade negotiating framework that developed after World War II.",2025-04-03 00:22:10,281,Silicon_Knight,worldnews

From an economic perspective, I currently consider the Chinese leadership to be significantly more competent than the American one.

If you look at the forecasts of some experts, you often read that the US could still win, albeit with heavy losses, if it wanted to defend Taiwan or wage war against China.



However, Trump wasn't yet in office when most of these forecasts were made.  
The US has weakened almost all of its relationships with allies and severely damaged its economy.  
And that was just the beginning.

I assume the Chinese government is well aware of this.  
They simply have to wait until the financial repercussions, and thus the impact on the US military, become more and more apparent.

Once China knows that the US can no longer win a war against a major power outside its continent, it can attack Taiwan.

Frankly, I also suspect that this will happen then.

By sea would be their best bet, but even then that area of the Baltic and North Sea are rife with Germany's NATO allies. 

So that leaves nukes, and nobody believes Russia is going to use nukes for something like that. If they did they'd get nuked right back. So really Russia has no options for ""escalation"". Some might say they would do more covert sabotage, but the thing is they are ***already*** doing that, hence the word **more**, and even that could be grounds for NATO reprisal if they get caught. So really Russia has no threats they can leverage against Germany, or practically anyone else for that matter.

mn93n31,1jzp268,reddit,">**The Kremlin criticized Germany’s chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz on Monday over comments suggesting Germany might send Taurus long-range missiles to Ukraine.**

>Merz, leader of the center-right Christian Democratic Union, was asked by German public broadcaster ARD if he would supply Kyiv with Taurus missiles and said he would consider it if it were part of a wider package of support agreed with European allies.

>“This must be jointly agreed. And if it’s agreed, then Germany should take part,” said Merz on Sunday. He is due to take office next month.

>Germany has been one of Ukraine’s main military backers, granting roughly € 7.1 billion in military assistance in 2024 alone, according to government data.

>But despite Kyiv's repeated requests, Berlin has never supplied Taurus missiles, which have a range of more than 300 miles (480 km).

>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters it was clear from his comments that Merz would advocate a “tougher position” which “will inevitably lead only to a further escalation of the situation around Ukraine.”

>“Unfortunately, it’s true that European capitals are not inclined to look for ways to reach peace talks but are rather inclined to further instigate the continuation of the war,” he told a daily briefing.

>The outgoing Social Democratic Party Chancellor Olaf Scholz had ruled out sending them to Kyiv.

>Both the U.S. and the United Kingdom have supplied long-range missiles to Ukraine.

>Germany and Sweden jointly manufacture the Taurus missile, costing approximately one million euros each.

>The powerful, hi-tech missile weighs 1,400 kg and is launched from a fighter jet. It is designed to target enemy bunker systems, command and control centers, ports, and bridges.

>In the ARD interview, Merz also said Ukraine needed to go on the offensive against Russia and suggested destroying the Kerch bridge that links Russia and Crimea should be an objective.

Many advanced polls in smaller communities have only one or two booths, so lines are inevitable if a lot of folks turn up at the same time. Election Day polling places will have many more stations set up as that's traditionally when the majority of voters come out.  

You can also vote at your local Elections office or apply to vote by mail, though the deadline is the 22nd on that option.

mmrfqwx,1jxjufb,reddit,">Currently, cannabis is legal for adult use at a national level in Uruguay, Canada, Malta, Luxembourg, Germany, and South Africa. Additionally, two dozen states in the U.S. have adopted recreational cannabis measures, regional adult-use pilot trials are operating in the Netherlands and Switzerland, and top courts in multiple other countries have ruled against adult-use prohibition policies.

>Chile is another country that may join the list of legalized nations, with lawmakers having recently introduced a measure that would legalize cannabis for adult use in the South American country if approved.

>“Chile is entering a new chapter in its cannabis policy. Lawmakers have introduced a comprehensive bill to regulate adult-use cannabis, advocacy groups are rallying behind it and one of the country’s top presidential candidates has pledged to push for legalization if elected.” stated [*Benzinga*](https://www.benzinga.com/news/legal/25/04/44743798/chile-moves-to-legalize-adult-use-cannabis-with-backing-from-presidential-candidate) in its original coverage.

>“The bill outlines several major changes: adults would be allowed to cultivate up to six flowering plants, store up to 800 grams annually and carry up to 40 grams in public. Consumption would remain restricted to private spaces; public use—including in schools, transport or around minors—would be prohibited. Cultivation collectives of up to 500 members would be legal as long as distribution is limited to members and not commercialized.” the outlet also reported.

>Cannabis legalization models differ across the globe, with no two jurisdictions having the exact same legalization model. Canada has the most robust adult-use commerce system, with sales permitted nationwide, including sales to non-residents. Uruguay also permits adult-use sales, yet they are limited to residents only.

>What is being proposed in Chile is more akin to legalization models in Germany and Malta, both of which permit home cultivation, personal possession, and cultivation associations. However, the cultivation and possession limits being proposed in Chile are considerably greater than what is currently permitted in Germany and Malta.",2025-04-12 17:12:36,30,BubsyFanboy,worldnews

mky425p,1jpbeq3,reddit,"Snippet from this news article: “Russian forces’ advance into Ukraine has slowed significantly in the past few months, with Moscow seizing just 133 square kilometers in March, the lowest monthly total since June 2024, battlefield monitoring group DeepState reported on April 1.

The pace of Russia’s offensive had steadily increased since July, peaking in November when Russian troops captured 725 square kilometers, overrunning a badly overstretched Ukrainian defense in several areas, especially in the south of Donetsk Oblast.

Gains have consistently declined since the beginning of winter, with the Russian army seizing 401 square kilometers in December, 321 in January, and 189 in February.

This relative stabilization of the front line was achieved thanks to the winter conditions, effective work of Ukrainian drone units, and a temporary exhaustion of Russian offensive potential.

Russian forces continue offensive operations, particularly around the city of Pokrovsk in in Donetsk Oblast, where fighting intensified at the end of March.

Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on March 31 that Russian forces are “stalling” and failing to advance in the area. Pokrovsk, located about 70 kilometers northwest of Donetsk, remains a major flashpoint.

While Russia’s advances in Ukraine have slowed, its forces have nearly reversed Ukraine’s territorial gains in Russia’s Kursk Oblast. Ukraine controlled 407 square kilometers there in early March but held just 70 square kilometers by month’s end, DeepState reported.

Ukraine had initially seized 1,300 square kilometers of Russian territory before Moscow, reinforced by North Korean units, launched a counteroffensive. Since launching operations in Kursk Oblast, Russian forces have suffered over 55,000 casualties, Syrskyi said on March 27.

DeepState warned that Russian forces previously engaged in Kursk may now be redeployed elsewhere, posing additional threats along the front line.",2025-04-02 00:26:08,32,AndroidOne1,worldnews

mmq518e,1jxexg2,reddit,">**Germany’s defense minister has said that peace in Ukraine “appears out of reach in the immediate future” following a meeting of Ukraine’s closest allies in Brussels.**

>“Given Russia’s ongoing aggression against Ukraine, we must concede that peace in Ukraine appears to be out of reach in the immediate future…Russia needs to understand that Ukraine is able to go on fighting, and we will support it,” Boris Pistorius said. 

>Pistorius made the comments at a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group on Friday, which he co-chaired alongside his British counterpart, John Healey. 

>The Ukraine Defense Contact Group is a forum bringing together NATO members and other countries that have supported Ukraine – such as Australia and Japan – set up by the Biden administration during the first weeks of Russia’s invasion of its neighbor. 

>Since President Donald Trump returned to power in January, however, the U.S. has stepped back from the role of chairing the group, with the U.K. now taking a more prominent leadership role. 

>American Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was a notable physical absence at Friday’s meeting — which was attended by defense ministers from around 50 countries — choosing to instead make an appearance virtually.

>Pistorius insisted Hegseth’s choice not to attend in person was due to scheduling reasons, adding: “The most important fact was that he took part.” 

>At the same time, the minister acknowledged that it was not clear how U.S. support for Ukraine would develop in the future. 

>Trump has made finding a resolution to the war in Ukraine a priority of his administration, saying he wants to be remembered as a peacemaker.

>However, many European powers are concerned Trump could be turning his back on Europe for a bargain that makes significant concessions to Putin.

>On the same day of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting, Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, arrived in Moscow for reported talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

>NATO allies, meanwhile, pledged over €21 billion in new military aid to Kyiv on Friday, with Berlin set to provide four IRIS-T air defense systems with 300 missiles.

>The U.K. announced that, alongside Norway, it would provide money for radar systems, anti-tank mines and hundreds of thousands of drones.

>Friday’s meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group also comes a day after a gathering of the so-called “coalition of the willing,” a group of countries led by France and the U.K. that are willing to send peacekeeping forces into Ukraine following a future ceasefire agreement. 

>The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said consensus on how such a peacekeeping mission would work has not yet been reached, and that “discussions are still ongoing,” British newspaper The Telegraph reported. ",2025-04-12 12:55:49,14,BubsyFanboy,worldnews

> US and western intelligence officials do not believe that Russia is interested in negotiating a ceasefire deal with Ukraine in good faith, CNN has reported. Moscow still believes it can sustain its war effort and outlast Ukraine on the battlefield.

>A senior NATO official reiterated that on Thursday, saying that “Russia still believes that time mostly is on its side.”

>“We have had questions for a long time about whether Putin intends to negotiate in good faith,” the official said. Russia is “willing to continue those talks [about mending ties with the US] at the same time that it is delaying and stalling and saying that they can’t accept the US proposals right now, on the actual ceasefire. I think all of that supports the idea that Russia’s goals haven’t changed at all—that right now, what it is trying to do is probably stall for time, make less concessions on the war, and try to instead make progress on sanctions, on Russia’s place in the international community.”

And keeping Boris Pistorius as the Defense Minister in the new government is indicative that some brainpower is being applied to governance, not just fear.  Boris inspires confidence among allies.  As reluctant as it has been in the past Germany is a beacon of the west and the tentatively of prior government leadership was a real drag.

I just hope NATO sans America really pushes hard in the next few months and completely takes over leadership and supply for Ukraine in every possible context.  I wish America was with you and many if not most of us individually are totally in support of Ukraine and its allies, but we are currently ruled by clowns and our electoral system has declined to the point that the tail wags the dog.  While we sort this out sadly we are unreliable.  I know American aid is continuing to Ukraine but the issue is the reliability, and Ukraine needs reliability.  That sends a message to the enemy Russia.

Everything I have read seems to indicate that this year is a transformative year for Ukraine.  The latter part of 2023 and 2024 were focused on the nascent stages of building/rebuilding military industrial capacity.  Very late 2024 and 2025 is the period much of it accelerates to full capacity and builds upon itself.  Resulting in the EU and Ukraine substantially obtaining independence of America.  Not 100% but vastly improved vs 2022/2023.

Trump desires this break from Ukraine but for the wrong reasons.  However, he is willing to rape Ukraine prior to it achieving that independence and he is pushing hard knowing the day is coming when he will be an afterthought and just a very distasteful remembrance of the past.

There is a reason these sites exist on the dark web and not the open net. It makes it very hard to find the operating location of the server and the location of the users.

mnezrt4,1k0fzoq,reddit,"People keep saying this ruling specifically extends protections to trans people from discrimination as if the ruling doesn't void the primary form of discrimination against trans people as no longer discrimination but law. 

This is a horrible precedent for trans people. Believe it or not the vast majority of trans people are not abusing sex based services as some attack on cis people. It simply makes no practical sense to segregate trans people on biological sex for most sex segregation situations and when it is done this way it greatly harms trans people and significantly increases their risks of being victimized, significantly more than cis people ever getting victimized by trans people. 

This kind of mandate basically says that bearded trans men with penises who may have spent most of their lives already as men must be placed with cis women, in jails, locker rooms, bathrooms, womens shelters, etc. Meanwhile transwomen with vaginas must be placed with men in all these same places. Absolutely outing them to literally everyone. But you can't discriminate against them for being outed or forced into these spaces... as if that'll happen. 

Believe it or not not all trans people look like the stereotype you have in your head. Way more of us fly under the radar than you think. More of us every year live longer as our transitioned gender than our gender assigned to our biological sex. 

Without having any nuance to these laws all that is happening is shafting trans people harder, creating more opportunities for discrimination for anyone that 'doesn't look like they belong' in the mandated sexually segregated spaces, raising tension and only 'saving' a tiny tiny portion of people ever victimized by trans people at the cost of all trans people. 

And that doesn't even get into how much this shafts intersex people that'll just have to go with whatever their doctors or parents wanted at birth.",2025-04-16 14:39:49,-11,agprincess,worldnews

>Speaking at a regional security conference, Hegseth said that China-based companies were controlling land and critical infrastructure in strategic sectors.

>“China’s military has too large of a presence in the western hemisphere,” Hegseth said. “Make no mistake, Beijing is investing and operating in this region for military advantage and unfair economic gain.”

>He called on the region’s governments to work together to deter China and address threats posed by transnational drug cartels and mass immigration.

>Hegseth was speaking a day after meeting Panama’s President José Raúl Mulino and touring the Panama Canal. The two countries agreed to step up security coordination and appeared to say they would work toward a way to pay back fees that U.S. warships pay to pass through the Panama Canal.

>The visit comes amid tensions over U.S. President Donald Trump’s repeated assertions that the U.S. is being overcharged to use the Panama Canal and that China has influence over its operations — allegations that Panama has denied.

Sure, he's getting intelligence briefings and all the information that goes along with his job, but if I was, say, the director of the Center for Disease Control, and they started giving me all kinds of detailed information about epidemics around the world, I simply wouldn't have the background/experience/knowledge to be able to parse it in an informed way.

I imagine Hegseth is in a similar situation - maybe he is getting up-to-date information about goings-on around the world, but as someone who had this job thrust upon him kind of out of the blue, he has no foundation upon which to build an understanding of the current situation around the world, so statements like this... don't really mean anything.

Just looking at the debris, 99% it's because of the large number of massive very heavy ACs and what looks like maybe some generators or power converters on a heavy concrete roof which apparently was damaged in fire some years back, inspections likely rushed or bribed off (because that's how a lot of the Caribbean operates if you have you ever spent any time there) so the nightclub could keep operating without having to do a very expensive roof replacement after the fire. Also, regular structural inspections of concrete roofs with lots of heavy crap on top of them should be followed to the letter, unknown if those requirements even exist in DR though. 

This is all on the owners and the building inspectors: allowing insufficient support for a heavy roof that had tons of heavy crap stacked on top of it and had already been damaged previously, then possibly suspending more stage and lighting crap from the roof on the inside without providing any more shoring, and on top of that having very loud events directly underneath this concrete roof that is of course going to reverberate and resonate with the loud music happening right below it.

Dear UN: Just fucking build everyone a Nuke plant that doubles as a UN base. 1 per country upon request. Staff it with UN staff on a rotating bases. Anyone country can have 1. They can purchase additional ones from the UN. Then a small surcharge to cover the costs and then excess energy can be use to convert into exportable resources (hydrogen gas for example, i know it's shitty but just using it as an example) that can then be sold on an open market with the nation getting 60% of the net revenue and the rest going back into the UN Energy Services.

A: counties can get access to clean, well regulated, safe energy without the worry of weaponization.

B: A bit of stability since the facility doubles as a small UN base and economic buffering from the sale of the excess energy in one form or another.

C: The rotating staff from the UN would help stimulate the economy around the facility. Peace through trade.

D: Cheap clean power means more food, safer industries.

mosk35e,1k6mr3x,reddit,"Reading between the lines, even though there are no direct negotiations, this does seem to be a response to the US public offer yesterday of agreeing to mutually lower tariffs to 50-65% and to make further sectoral carveouts. The Chinese counterproposal is to have unilateral cancellation of US-imposed tariffs, which would be very hard for Trump to do after making a big deal of imposing them in the first place, but an impending supply shock going into summer would badly complicate domestic support at a time when Trump's reconciliation bill is being marked up and support for immigration policies is waning.

And in the mean time, it seems even the fastest trade MOUs aren't going to be signed in the near term. Japan is trying to get something done, but their thinking is to have a deal signed at the G7 in June, and they can't risk alienating China either as China is a larger trade partner to them than the US. The same is true for a lot of European and Southeast Asian nations too.

“Freezing the war” is not the same as “ending the war”. This implies that the war will restart at some point, and is absolutely not a good faith effort at a peace deal. Especially considering the whole “no NATO membership” thing. It’s literally more of the same garbage Russia has been saying for years.

Second thing, and it may be unpopular, at some point Ukraine is going to have to give up any hope of getting Crimea back, assuming they haven’t privately done so already. I’ve seen a lot of comments in the last few years say “only end the war if we return to the pre-2014 lines and Russia pays for all the damage they’ve caused” which is just completely unrealistic. As much as I’d love for that to be the case, you’re asking a country who is currently gaining territory (and resources) thanks to their war, to just have a complete opposite change of heart and say “you know what, all those people died for nothing. Here’s everything we took back *and* we’ll pay you”. If Russia was on the brink of ceasing to exist, I could see this as an actual realistic option. But I genuinely do not know what reason they would ever have to accept something like that. 

Unfortunately we have to live with the fact that, assuming this isn’t going to be a 20+ year war, Russia is going to walk away with territory from their illegal war. I hope they lose as many people and as much money as possible in the process, but it’s not realistic to expect the side currently “winning” (if you can call it that) to essentially accept the terms you’d only be offering someone in an unconditional surrender.",2025-04-22 20:48:54,21,pkosuda,worldnews

mnj3awx,1k0yuoq,reddit,"Israel isn't a state party to the icc, and when travelling in his capacity as a government official Netanyahu enjoys the protection of the Vienna convention, which codifies a much older and much more important practice.  If I were a in charge of a state, I would protect the Vienna convention over the Rome statute.

Now, if he was travelling as a private citizen that might be different.

The icc knows this. But they are obliged to do their own thing, which is to demand states party to the Rome Statute follow it or at least explain why they won't.

Vienna must take precedence, otherwise what could very quickly happen is the Israelis would seize embassy staff of the offending country, and or threaten the use of force to retrieve their head of government.  The fact that something like this could spiral in escalation is why the Vienna convention takes precedence.

As a head of government Netanyahu will travel with armed guards who would be authorized to use deadly force to defend him.  If he is successfully detained, the Israeli state would retaliate, if it escalates beyond just two countries, China, India, the US and Russia would all be on the side of him having diplomatic immunity, and if you are going to make enemies it's not wise to pick on the 3 most populous counties in the word, the 3 richest etc. All at once.",2025-04-17 04:01:31,114,sir_sri,worldnews

I think we have a lot of guilt being the place where Trump's grandfather made his initial fortune.

Starlink has been a hard one for us though, Our local internet is pretty awful and unreliable, and in today's age it's becoming more and more important we have functional internet.
Last year we had a 30 or so hour long telecommunications outage. No internet, no cellphones, etc. It was... honestly pretty amazing, however the banks couldn't operate, lots of businesses couldn't function, and the government couldn't work.

So we had a sudden large push of everyone starting to get starlink. I kinda hated seeing that because of Elon, but this was also before the election in the states and everything that's happened since.

Now a lot of us are really feeling a lot of guilt over supporting Elon as well, So people are beginning to drop starlink \[if they care\]

We've already decided to not get it at my workplace, after planning for a long time to do so.

Friedrich Trump called his business in Bennett, a town that sprang up because of the Klondike Gold Rush, the Arctic Restaurant & Hotel.

Parks Canada says the replica at the Chilkoot Trail National Historic Site was constructed in 2017, and the kitchen inside is now exclusively used by government workers. (…)

A 90-year-old Yukoner who wrote a booklet about men who became wealthy off the gold rush, including Friedrich Trump, says the replica should remind President Trump to show gratitude to Canada rather than launching a trade war and annexation bid against it.»",2025-04-04 22:05:46,4,Billy_Ektorp,worldnews

one imagines they are planning to bunkerbust the hell out of Iran. which is risky, because if they miss anything Iran will have every incentive to push rapidly ahead with at least one functional nuclear bomb (something they seem to already be doing). A single loose nuke could be used as a retribution weapon if it could be smuggled appropriately. 

normally I'd expect NEST/NNSA would be able to intercept any such device, but with the cuts across the government its hard to say. a lot of people who work NEST are borrowed from other agencies and are not full time, so if people have been cut already there may be a whole in US capabilities to stop a loose nuke hidden in say a shipping container filled with bananas or the like.",2025-03-28 23:53:19,4,Iyellkhan,worldnews

So, what reason does Iran have to agree to any deal with the US, when we have already violated previous deals?   What's the incentive for Iran to slow down when the US will merely use it as an opportunity to gain the initiative?

It's so stupid.  Trump's threats are empty because he'll follow through with them regardless of any deal, so other countries are inclined to just do whatever they want, regardless of the US interests.

'**International law prohibits states from intervening in the internal and external affairs of other states, but only if the method of intervention is coercive.** This Article argues that coercion can be understood in two different ways or models. First, as **coercion-as-extortion**, a demand coupled with a threat of harm or the infliction of harm, done to extract some kind of concession from the victim state—in other words, an act targeting the victim state's will or decision-making calculus. Second, as **coercion-as-control**, an action materially depriving the victim state of its ability to control its sovereign choices. This may be done even through acts like cyber operations that the victim state is entirely unaware of. The Article argues that many of the difficulties surrounding the notion of coercion arise as a consequence of failing to distinguish between these two different models.

mkv3yav,1jox8xr,reddit,"> “We will approach these negotiations from a position of strength,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a speech to the European Parliament on Tuesday, the eve of Trump’s big tariff announcement.

> “Europe holds a lot of cards. From trade to technology, to the size of our market. But this strength is also built on our readiness to take firm countermeasures. All instruments are on the table.”

> In targeting U.S. services, Brussels could be thinking of bulge-bracket banks like J.P. Morgan or Bank of America, or tech players like Elon Musk’s social network X, search giant Google, or Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer.

>...

> The EU is a net exporter of automobiles, pharmaceuticals and food to the U.S. But it’s a net importer of services — and that gives it more leverage in a trade dispute. (Taking goods and services together, transatlantic trade is actually broadly in balance. The EU enjoys an overall surplus of just $50 billion, or about 3 percent of the $1.7 trillion in annual transatlantic commerce.)

> “America’s tech giants, financial industry, and pharma companies have deep roots in Europe. Push too far, and Brussels could tighten the screws: digital levies on Silicon Valley, regulatory clamps on Wall Street, or taxes on U.S. pharma exports,” said Tobias Gehrke, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. 

>...

> The thing is, there are only so many goods you can hit when the damage is so big. 

> “If Trump imposes reciprocal tariffs, we are entering a whole new game,” said an EU diplomat, granted anonymity, like others quoted in this story, to speak candidly.

> Depending on Trump’s own playbook, there are two broad ways the Commission could go about hitting services.

> First, by making use of the existing regulations it has built over the last five years, it can tighten rules governing Big Tech; tax major American banks; or slow the issuance of licenses to do business in the EU. 

> “When you see the positioning of the big American tech companies over the last few months, who are all close to Trump, you get the impression that they’re lobbying the White House against Europe. In fact, they’re extremely vulnerable to retaliatory measures,” said Yves Melin, a founding partner at law firm Cassidy Levy Kent. 

> A case in point is the bloc’s Digital Markets Act, which seeks to curb the power of dominant tech players and safeguard competition. The Commission is set to decide as soon as this week whether Apple and Meta are in breach of those rules. 

> But it’s also an area where Brussels will be cautious of fanning the flames. 

> “The problem with the digital part is that the moment the EU does that, the pressure from the U.S on the regulatory framework will even increase,” said Arnoud Willems, partner for international trade at law firm King & Spalding. 

> Taxing financial transactions and digital flows, or making American airlines pay more to land in European airports, are other levers available to the EU, he added.

> The EU could also restrict the access of U.S. companies to public contracts under its new International Procurement Instrument. If Brussels shuts out American energy or consulting firms from EU public contracts, that would hit a major revenue source.

>...

> As a last resort the EU can deploy its trade “bazooka” — the Anti-Coercion Instrument. As the name suggests, it would enable a broad-spectrum response, including targeting services, if Brussels concludes that U.S. actions are excessive.

> “These things are in principle … possible, for example, under the Anti-Coercion Instrument,” said the senior EU official cited above when asked whether the EU would hit trade in services.

> Within six months the Commission could go as far as to pull the plug on Musk’s X; restrict the intellectual property rights of U.S. tech giants; or bar them from investing in the EU.

>;While the EU executive would call the shots on when to use that nuclear option, it would need the support of 15 out of its 27 member countries to decide whether and how to strike. 

> “Many member states don’t want to escalate by triggering an anti-coercion case,” said the EU diplomat quoted above.

> European businesses also worry about going down that route.

> “The problem with all these ideas of leverage is that they are not really leverage,” said Luisa Santos, deputy director general at corporate lobby group BusinessEurope. 

> “Our economies are so intertwined … that even if you impose tariffs or any other measure on the services side, you will be hurting your own interest,” she added. 

> And even as it signals its willingness to escalate, Brussels also hopes to bring Washington to the negotiating table. Trade Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič is hoping his U.S. counterparts can settle on a “term sheet” that sets out a framework for talks — when the next round of tariffs takes effect.

> These could entail lowering duties, investing in American defense firms, boosting purchases of U.S. liquefied natural gas, or softening some regulations.",2025-04-01 14:50:08,51,DifusDofus,worldnews

**Suspension of Indus Waters Cooperation**: India has suspended the Indus Waters Treaty, under which 39 billion cubic meters of water from the Indus River system flows from India into Pakistan annually. The treaty, which governs the sharing of river waters between the two countries, has long been considered a symbol of cooperation even amid years-long conflict.

**Closure of Attari-Wagah Border**: The iconic Attari-Wagah land crossing, a critical point for trade and people-to-people contact between India and Pakistan, has been shut down with immediate effect.

**Ban on Pakistani Nationals Entering India**: The entry of Pakistani citizens into India has been suspended indefinitely. This includes both visa services and cross-border travel permits.

**Expulsion of Military Advisors**: All military advisors posted at the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi have been expelled, signalling a downgrade in military-to-military diplomatic engagement.

**Reduction of High Commission Staff Strength**: India has asked Pakistan to reduce its diplomatic presence in New Delhi to a skeletal staff of 30, effectively slashing the mission's current operating capacity of 55",2025-04-23 16:02:59,265,RGV_KJ,worldnews

Glad you did it first!

It's a very substantial development as Indus water treaty is a major pact between the two countries that hadn't been touched.

Pakistan is a failed military state masquerading as an 'Ally to the west Democratic nation'. Situations are certainly starting to stirr up. Water is a very precious commodity in Pakistan owing to the extensive irrigation policies from British Era till now.

I think we may see further rising in tensions between these two states, with this being the accelerator.

motoavs,1k62ulu,reddit,"As India is the upper riparian country, it had all the cards, and Pakistan depends on the Indus Valley Basin for a majority of its domestic needs. The treaty was not at all favorable to India, but the then Prime Minister Nehru went ahead with it, thinking that it would help foster some cooperation with Pakistan. Obviously, that never happened. India and Pakistan have gone to war four times after it, along with multiple skirmishes over the decades, but India has upheld its part of the deal throughout.


In 2019, after the Pulwama terror attack, India, which was using only 14% of its mandated 20%, started using the full 20% of its own share, which Pakistan didn’t like. Now, there are talks of suspending the treaty entirely. 


The Indus Water Treaty does not have an exit clause as it was meant to last indefinitely. Generally, India has a good reputation for honoring its treaties, but I wonder on what basis it could get out of this one. Without an exit clause, it’s difficult, but following the maxim rebus sic stantibus, a party may no longer be bound by a contract if there has been a fundamental change in the circumstances that existed at the time it was signed, though the claim is tenuous. Or by mutual consent of both countries, though i don't see that happening. 


Though this is an existential threat to Pakistan, realistically India cannot do much to divert much of the water immediately. It would take 10-15 years to do that. ",2025-04-24 17:29:58,7,Affectionate_Bee6432,worldnews

Yes, Pakistan has a history with LeT. No one’s denying that.

>The reporters – Antonina Favorskaya, Sergei Karelin, Konstantin Gabov and Artem Kriger – have been on trial behind closed doors since October on charges, which they deny, of belonging to an “extremist” group established by Navalny in 2011.

>Prosecutors claimed the four had produced material for the YouTube channel of Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK), according to Reuters, which is prohibited under the country’s “foreign agents law.” Amnesty International has warned that the “repressive” legislation is an “attack on freedom of association” in Russia, where Moscow has increasingly attempted to stifle journalists under censorship laws.

>In February, mourners gathered at Navalny’s graveside in the Russian capital to mark the first anniversary of his death in prison. Dozens of people were detained at memorials, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW) and other rights groups.

>Over his storied political career, Navalny generated some of the largest anti-government demonstrations in recent years, and unfurled corruption at Russia’s highest seat of power, under the FBK.

>Navalny died suddenly at the age of 47 on February 16, 2024, while serving a 19-year sentence on extremism charges he denied. At the time, Russia’s prison service claimed he “felt unwell after a walk.” But Navalny’s wife, Yulia Navalnaya, and former US President Joe Biden have long held Russian President Vladimir Putin responsible for his death. Moscow has rebuffed those allegations.

MOSCOW, March 28 (Reuters) - Russia accused Ukraine on Friday of attacking its energy facilities despite a moratorium on such strikes, saying a gas infrastructure unit in the town of Sudzha had been destroyed and reserving the right to hit back against such attacks.
A Ukrainian official said it was Russia that attacked the gas transit point in Sudzha and the Ukrainian military said Kyiv “strictly adheres” to the moratorium. Reuters could not independently establish which side was responsible.

The United States announced separate agreements with Ukraine and Russia on Tuesday to pause their strikes in the Black Sea and against each other’s energy targets - potential stepping stones that Washington hopes will lead to a full ceasefire and peace talks to bring a definitive end to three years of war.
Each side has accused the other of breaking the energy truce, underscoring the fragility of the U.S.-brokered agreements. Ukraine’s general staff said Russia had attacked energy facilities in the Kherson and Poltava regions of Ukraine in the past day.

Sudzha, in Russia’s western region of Kursk, is the site of a gas metering station at the transit point where Russia pumped gas by pipeline across Ukraine and into Europe until the end of last year.
Flows stopped on January 1 after Ukraine declined to renew the deal because of the war that has been fought since Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February 2022.
In a daily conference call with reporters on Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Ukraine was continuing its strikes on Russian energy facilities.",2025-03-28 17:11:19,7,AndroidOne1,worldnews

mnwpk7n,1k2rbwr,reddit,">**More than 150 beaches along Russia’s southern Black Sea coast remain unsuitable for summer vacations due to ongoing contamination from a recent oil spill, the head of Russia’s consumer safety watchdog said Friday.**

>Oil slicks continue to be detected off the coast of Anapa, a popular resort town in the Krasnodar region, nearly four months after two aging Russian tankers were damaged in a powerful storm. The vessels released thousands of tons of heavy fuel oil into the sea, sparking an environmental crisis that has since cast serious doubt over the upcoming tourist season.

>“The Temryuksky district and the coastal areas of Anapa don’t meet the requirements for organizing summer resort holidays,” Rospotrebnadzor chief Anna Popova told reporters, according to the Interfax news agency.

>“At present, 141 beaches in Anapa and nine beaches in Temryuk have failed to meet pollution, sanitary and hygiene standards and cannot be used for health and recreational purposes.”

>The Temryuksky district lies just east of the Kerch Strait and borders annexed Crimea, another popular summer destination. Emergency workers have been deployed across affected areas to contain the spill and clean up contaminated coastlines, including beaches on the annexed Crimean peninsula.

>Despite the pollution, Russian authorities have continued to organize spring and summer trips to the affected areas for groups, including children with disabilities, raising safety concerns.

>In January, a 17-year-old university student died in Anapa after he was reportedly exposed to toxic fumes during volunteer efforts to clean up the oil spill.

>Still, on Friday, Popova offered a more optimistic assessment of the situation in Crimea and its port city of Sevastopol.

>“More than 6,000 samples tested... have shown no violations of hygienic norms,” she said, crediting rapid cleanup work for the relatively safe conditions. In contrast, over 60,000 samples were analyzed in the more severely affected Anapsky and Temryuksky districts.

>Popova noted that while “small spills” continue to be observed along the coast, they are being localized and contained swiftly. They “don’t affect the overall condition of the coastline,” she said.

>The spill and slow cleanup effort have already caused a steep drop in tourist demand for Anapa, threatening local economies that rely heavily on seasonal visitors. Last month, the government environmental watchdog Rosprirodnadzor said the oil spill had caused an estimated 84.9 billion rubles ($1 billion) in environmental damage.

>The companies that own the two oil tankers involved in the disaster face multiple lawsuits from regional prosecutors, the Russian Maritime Rescue Service and the city of Anapa, which in March said that it had spent 211 million rubles ($2.4 million) on beach cleanup since the Dec. 15 spill.

>According to an investigation by transportation authorities, the ships were not supposed to sail in the open sea during winter, as they were designed mainly for river navigation and calm coastal areas.",2025-04-19 10:57:44,8,BubsyFanboy,worldnews

mkndt1t,1jntwvx,reddit,"One thing that's totally foolish is how these NGOs typically are pro Palestine and anti-Israel. Their messages online are extremely hostile and their workers have all picked one side despite sometimes living in Israel or visiting Israel to relax. I'm not going to speculate on single cases. But you really don't want to constantly piss off one side in a war as an NGO. If they were extremely pro Israel it would be a mistake too. At the end of the day we are still talking about single soldiers deciding if your name and logo should protect you in any single case. You'd want single soldiers to always error towards keeping you safe. What happens if you have 6 Hamas fighters in your car using it for safe transport to a battle? And now you have opposing soldiers seeing this knowing you hate their side. So they figure you are working for Hamas directly.

You'd have single soldiers erroring on the side of hitting Hamas even if your trucks are nearby. It's still wrong and should not happen. But it's like the NGOs don't understand common sense. Why are you showing extreme animosity towards a side with guns and rockets? Just putting the lives of your workers in danger. It's totally perplexing and horrid.

Imagine if an NGO helped during the Iraq war and then on their site talked about how evil the Ba'ath party is, daily. Do you think it would keep your workers more or less safe? Or they could talk about how evil USA is for being there. You better hope both those single American soldiers responsible for the drone strikes have never visited your site or read your propaganda.

I would straight up refuse to work for such groups. And I don't understand why they would ever think their anti-Israel messaging is a smart idea.

Tell your workers to not speak up online for one side or the other while they work. I think a lot of people have a totally misguided understanding of Israel like it's an army making no errors as they are Western and modern. They absolutely make errors, daily.

*President Xi Jinping on Wednesday stressed that China would stand with Malaysia and other Asian nations to combat unilateralism and protectionism, as the Trump administration's U.S. tariff policies cloud economic prospects in the region.*

*Xi was in Malaysia for a three-day state visit, his first trip to the Southeast Asian country since 2013.*

*""In the face of shocks to global order and economic globalization, China and Malaysia will stand with countries in the region to combat the undercurrents of geopolitical and camp-based confrontation, as well as the countercurrent of unilateralism and protectionism,"" Xi said during his dinner party speech. ""Together, we will safeguard the bright prospects of our Asian family.""*

*Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim also touched on the recent trade tensions in his dinner speech. ""Trade is not a contest of winners and losers, but a shared endeavor. ... What we are witnessing today is not an honest reckoning with the imperfections of globalization, but a retreat into economic tribalism,"" he said, adding that trade tariffs are being weaponized.*

*""China has been a rational, strong and reliable partner. Malaysia values this consistency,"" Anwar said.*

*The two countries, on the same day, exchanged a total of 31 memoranda of understanding (MOU) and bilateral agreements, spanning security, trade, infrastructure, digital economy, education, and cultural cooperation, highlighting further collaboration in various areas.*

*""China-Malaysia relations are now entering a new golden era,"" Xi told Anwar at the beginning of their meeting earlier in the day.*",2025-04-16 13:43:15,130,NikkeiAsia,worldnews

mm3wyyq,1jupgh9,reddit,"Snippet from this news article:”A drone strike destroyed a missile storage facility and a technical building used to service Kh-22 and Kh-32 missiles at Russia’s Shaikovka airbase, according to the satellite imagery published by Ukrainian OSINT team “CyberBoroshno” on April 7.

The airbase, home to Tu-22M3 strategic bombers, was targeted by drones during the night of March 31, 2025.

The strike significantly damaged the base’s infrastructure, particularly a facility for preparing Kh-22/32 missiles, where fueling and launch configuration occurs.

According to CyberBoroshno, these missiles require liquid fuel, but satellite images show that the stationary fueling stations have vanished following the strike.

Destroyed storage facilities for the supersonic Kh-22/32 missiles were also identified at the airbase. One heavily damaged depot was located near an aircraft parking area, as confirmed by satellite imagery.

In one section of the base, the object present could not be clearly identified. Visually, it appears that it may be aircraft wreckage, though it’s also possible that it is the remains of a building.

At the time of the attack, local authorities reported that 24 drones were launched at the base and claimed that all had been successfully intercepted by air defense systems. However, they did not comment on the explosions that were heard at the facility.

Together they have more people, more money and plenty of tech, military toys (including nukes) and natural resources – including much more oil - to work with each other - and leave the US outside looking in.  China can be a part of this. Let the MAGAs find out what relying on Russia is like. The US has been in decline for some time; MAGA stuff and moves like this are just a sort of official recognition of that fact. We are the latest second-rate nation on the world scene.  One of the great unintended ironies of all this is that MAGA, instead of making America great, are destroying what made American great in the first place, and in the process are rapidly pulling the US down toward the bottom of the pile.  We are becoming a second-rate nation with nukes. Like Russia.

Not long ago Trump declared, with his usual smug certainty, that from 1789 to 1913, the United States was the wealthiest it’s ever been, purely because of tariffs. According to him, we were collecting so much money so fast that the government didn’t know what to do with it. Of course, he left out the part where most Americans lived in poverty, where wealth was concentrated in a few monopolists' hands, and where child labor and 14-hour workdays – 6 or 7 days a week - were the norm. The “wealth” he refers to was largely theoretical for the average citizen and absolutely real for the Carnegies, the Rockefellers, and other Robber Barons of the Gilded Age. Tariffs weren’t some magic goose laying golden eggs, they were regressive taxes that hit working people hardest, all while padding the profits of a corrupt elite.

mkbngyp,1jmh2k4,reddit,"***The Telegraph reports:***

The death toll from [the powerful earthquake in Myanmar](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/03/28/myanmar-new-capital-city-dust-earthquake-thailand/) has surpassed 1,000, as rescuers use their bare hands to dig through rubble for survivors.

The country’s military regime said 1,002 people had been found dead after the shallow 7.7 magnitude quake hit the centre of the country on Friday afternoon, followed by several strong aftershocks.

The junta said in a statement that most of the dead were in the Mandalay, the country’s second largest city, and 2,367 people were confirmed injured.

Rescuers are now in a race against time to pull people from collapsed buildings.

# ‘We heard screams, then silence’

“We are doing our best to rescue survivors,” Yan Naing, a rescue worker at Sky Villa Condo, told The Telegraph. One of Mandalay’s most expensive apartment blocks, the building sank into the ground when the disaster struck.

“We heard screams last night, but this morning, there was silence. We continue to do everything we can to save lives.”

Some two miles away, Dr Aung Win said Mandalay General Hospital had been “overwhelmed by the surge in patients”.

“With so few doctors and nurses, our capacity is extremely limited,” Dr Win told the Telegraph. “We urgently need reinforcements. 

“It’s heartbreaking to see patients dying when they shouldn’t be, and we desperately need first aid kits. We were never prepared for a disaster like this.”

mlgohd5,1jrp5nn,reddit,"Let me posit a theory: Trump runs on getting the USA out of foreign wars. Trump knows very well that the Russians and Ukrainians have no intention of listening to the USA, but the idea sells well to voters so he runs with it. Once in office, Trump needs a way to endorse the war continuing without looking like he is flip-flopping. So, he strong-arms Ukraine to the table offering a deal that favors Russia, but doesn’t leave Russia in control of Ukraine. If Ukraine collapses under the pressure, the war ends. If Russia doesn’t take the deal he can say they were lying about wanting peace and keep sanctioning them and lay off Ukraine, while saying it is Russias fault, not his. Either way, he gets to stop spending time trying to stop that war.

If this is the case, since Ukraines defense hasn’t collapsed, I would expect to see Trump's team ramp up the rhetoric about the lack of peace being Putin’s fault, and stuff about the world shouldn’t have to wait on Russia for peace, etc. the goal being for that message to get to his base and gauge their reaction and see if they are OK with that excuse. It doesn’t matter so much if that rhetoric makes sense or how it is received by the left or other countries, since it is meant to appease his base.

It’s just a theory though. There are certainly many other possibilities for why Rubio is putting out this messaging.",2025-04-05 00:00:01,-2,BlueMaxx9,worldnews
mkiy0gy,1jnby15,reddit,"Abortion should just be a medical procedure.

In Canada, which has no abortion laws at all, all abortions are fully covered by the national health system. In addition real sex education is taught in the schools and female centric birth control is easily available. This has resulted in the actual number of abortions, not just the rate, falling for the last several years even though the number of women childbearing age is increasing.

Now having said that in Canada all abortions are done early in the first trimester, only 2-3% are done after 16 weeks, and no doctor performs abortions past 20 or 21 weeks except for compelling health or genetic reasons. Third trimester abortions are extremely rare and are only done if the mother's life is in immediate critical danger because it is safer to stabilize the mother so she can go to term than to introduce the physical trauma of an extremely late term abortion.

Where does all this money go if it's not going to building and maintaining the infrastructure? 

If the baseline cost to consteuxt a single in the GTA is 180k then it's ridiculous to expect houses to be sold at affordable levels for the average Canadian.

mornatm,1k6nhsy,reddit,">At least nine people have been killed and more than 70 injured in Kyiv after Russia carried out one of the most devastating air attacks against Ukraine for months, with Kharkiv and other cities also targeted.

>Waves of drones as well as ballistic and guided missiles struck the Ukrainian capital early on Thursday. There were explosions for much of the night, beginning at about 1am local time, and the rattle of anti-aircraft fire as Ukrainian defences tried to shoot the missiles down.

>Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said rescuers were pulling survivors from under the rubble. The injured included six children and a pregnant woman. A house, cars, and other buildings were set on fire, with extensive damage caused by falling debris in several districts, he said.

>“Russia has launched a massive combined strike on Kyiv,” Ukraine’s state emergency service said on Telegram. “According to preliminary data, nine people were killed, 63 injured.”

>Ukraine’s interior minister, Ihor Klymenko, said a big rescue operation was under way in the Svyatoshinsky district of Kyiv, involving dogs and engineering teams. “Mobile phones can be heard ringing under the ruins. The search will continue until everybody is got out. We have information about two children who cannot be found at the scene of the incident,” he added.

>On Wednesday evening, drones could be seen buzzing in the sky above the north-east Kharkiv region and flying over a forest. Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city, was hit by seven missiles and 12 kamikaze drones in strikes throughout the night as black smoke plumed overhead.

>According to Kharkiv’s mayor, several private houses, a factory and a high-rise apartment block were hit. “One of the most recent strikes hit a densely populated residential area. Two people were injured there,” Ihor Terekhov said, urging people to be careful.

>The onslaught came as Donald Trump lashed out at Volodymyr Zelenskyy for failing to support a US “peace plan”, in which Crimea and other Ukrainian territories would be handed to Russia.

>On Wednesday, Trump accused Ukraine’s president of prolonging the “killing field” and making “very harmful” statements. Zelenskyy has ruled out recognising Crimea as Russian and says a complete ceasefire is needed before any settlement can be discussed.

>On Thursday, Zelenskyy said he was cutting short a trip to South Africa because of the attack. “It has been 44 days since Ukraine agreed to a full ceasefire and a halt to strikes... And it has been 44 days of Russia continuing to kill our people,” Zelensky said in a post on X. “The strikes must be stopped immediately and unconditionally,” he added.

>The Ukrainian foreign minister, Andriy Sybiga, said Russia’s “maximalist demands for Ukraine to withdraw from its regions, combined with these brutal strikes, show that Russia, not Ukraine, is the obstacle to peace”.

>He added: “Moscow, not Kyiv, is where pressure should be applied. Putin demonstrates through his actions, not words, that he does not respect any peace efforts and only wants to continue the war. Weakness and concessions will not stop his terror and aggression. Only strength and pressure will.”",2025-04-24 10:58:25,3,BubsyFanboy,worldnews

Carney has shown a high level of competence and planning so far imo and has not shrunk from verbal confrontation like most politicians. His build up and arrival have been executed very well.

He has invaded multiple countries and has threatened many others with hostile actions. Yet, somehow people have decided to shirk off these threats because this line of rhetoric is something he has stated repeatedly as a warning against EU “encroachment”.

Yet, when Trump says anything regardless of what it is, humanity itself will end. I get it, you don’t have to like Trump, and to be honest I’m only using him to point out a bit of hypocrisy. If this current American Administration strikes fear in your hurt (A lot of Redditors believe our Government is colluding with Russia) then we should definitely be taking this serious.

What happens when a sick Putin, who is facing a possible loss or stalemate in this war, economic collapse and NATO troops at his doorstep. Decides he just doesn’t care anymore? Now, there are probably military checks and balances so that he doesn’t actually Nuke someone. But what if that’s just wishful thinking. 

Both Putin and his “Minions” have threatened a Nuclear strike, they aren’t stupid, knowing full well that if they did such an action it would be the end of Humanity.

But many countries have moved from ""manufacturing"" to ""service"" industry.  For example at one point Britain offshored much of their manufacturing and moved to being professionals such as architects, engineers, etc... who sold services to other countries.  

Sure that will *eventually* change again, but what they offer is next level tools.  Planes, nanometer fabrication tech, consulting, etc....  which require advanced technical minds.  

Anyhow, if you think manufacturing of iPhones is coming back with tariffs, than you are blocking those other services which actually make you money for what you ""think"" can come back.

mn8lre1,1jzokcb,reddit,"From Gemini, Google AI

According to multiple news sources from today, Tuesday, April 15, 2025:

The Chinese government has reportedly ordered its airlines to halt taking new deliveries of Boeing aircraft in response to increased US tariffs on Chinese goods.

Beijing has also allegedly asked Chinese carriers to stop purchasing aircraft-related equipment and parts from US companies.  

Boeing's gross backlog as of March 31, 2025, included 130 aircraft destined for Chinese airlines, which is about 2% of Boeing's total unfilled orders. This number includes both Boeing 737 MAX and Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft.

Additionally, reports indicate that around 35 more Boeing aircraft intended for Chinese carriers had their first flights between January 2019 and March 2025 but have not yet been delivered.

Therefore, while the exact number of purchased but not yet delivered Boeing airplanes is subject to the specifics of completed paperwork and the implementation of this new directive, it is estimated to be at least 130 aircraft with existing orders, and potentially more when considering already-built but not delivered planes.

But.. going to Wikipedia;

Going by Wikipedia, the current Chinese open orders are 247 aircraft with an average price around $100 million  each:

\- Air China: 4 Boeing 737 MAX 8

\- China Development Bank Aviation: 19 Boeing 737 MAX

\- China Eastern Airlines: 7 Boeing 737 MAX 8 & 6 Boeing 787-9

\- China Southern Airlines: 37 Boeing 737 MAX 8

\- Hainan Airlines: 33 Boeing 737 MAX 8

\- Juneyao Air: 1 Boeing 787-9

\- Kunming Airlines: 8 Boeing 737 MAX 8

\- Okay Airways: 2 Boeing 737-900ER, 5 Boeing 737 MAX 8, 8 Boeing 737 MAX 10 & 5 Boeing 787-9

\- Ruili Airlines: 60 Boeing 737 MAX & 6 Boeing 787-9s

\- Shandong Airlines: 18 Boeing 737 MAX 8

\- Shanghai Airlines: 3 Boeing 737 MAX 8 & 1 Boeing 787-9

\- Shenzen Airlines: 9 Boeing 737 MAX 8

\- XiamenAir: 10 Boeing 737 MAX 8, 10 Boeing 737 MAX 10 & 3 Boeing 787-9s

There is a discrepancy between Gemini and Wikipedia.

Nevertheless, these undelivered aircraft represent only part of the economic impact. The reported halt on Boeing parts will be an additional, significant blow, as the long-term revenue from parts and service contracts is often the most substantial aspect of these deals.

Not sure how China can switch its orders to Airbus; Airbus already has a significant backlog of orders. As of the end of March 2025, Airbus had a total order backlog of **24,825 aircraft**, with **332 aircraft on order from China-based airlines** (excluding lessors). Absorbing a large number of additional orders from Boeing customers would significantly extend Airbus's delivery timelines, which are already facing supply chain constraints.",2025-04-15 14:27:58,-11,sunsetair,worldnews

mo9xxox,1k4h9aj,reddit,"""The head of Israel's domestic intelligence service said on Monday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's bid to sack him followed his refusal to fulfil requests that included spying on Israeli protesters and disrupting the leader's corruption trial.

In an affidavit submitted to the Supreme Court, the head of Shin Bet, Ronen Bar, said that Netanyahu's March move to dismiss him was not based on professional grounds but was prompted by unmet expectations of personal loyalty to the prime minister.

In response, Netanyahu's office said it would soon deliver a detailed refute of Bar's affidavit, which it called ""false"".

Netanyahu's move to sack Bar fuelled [protests](https://archive.is/o/kfvpW/https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-opposition-netanyahu-finds-voice-war-returns-gaza-2025-03-19/) in Israel and was suspended by the Supreme Court, after political watchdogs and opposition lawmakers argued the dismissal was unlawful.

Critics say that the government is undermining key state institutions and endangering the foundations of Israeli democracy. Netanyahu's Likud party has [accused Bar](https://archive.is/o/kfvpW/https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-pm-netanyahus-party-steps-up-pressure-shin-bet-head-go-2025-04-15/) of acting against the prime minister and turning parts of the Shin Bet service into ""a private militia of the Deep State.""

Israel's government has [backed](https://archive.is/o/kfvpW/https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/anti-netanyahu-protesters-clash-with-israeli-police-2025-03-20/) Netanyahu, who said that he had lost confidence in Bar over the agency's failure to prevent the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, a security failure that had led to the country's deadliest day.

But in the unclassified part of his affidavit, Bar argued that the quest to oust him began more than a year after the attack. He cited a series of events between November 2024 and February 2025, which he said appeared to prompt the prime minister's moves against him.

Those included Shin Bet investigations into leaks of secret army documents to the media and possible links between Netanyahu aides and Qatar, and a Shin Bet inquiry into its own failings, which also pointed to the government ignoring warnings before the October 7 attack and policy failures that preceded it."" - Reuters",2025-04-21 16:13:47,99,Crossstoney,worldnews

ml4mscc,1jq5qke,reddit,"Snippet from this news article:”Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has said US tariffs on European Union imports are “wrong”, after US President Donald Trump announced he would begin charging a 20% rate on EU goods.
Meloni is one of the many world leaders reacting to Trump’s “liberation day” announcements, which include a universal 10% baseline tariff on all imports into the US from 5 April.
Around 60 countries - including the EU - will be hit with steeper tariffs from 9 April. Some of the highest rates will be levied on smaller countries, such as Lesotho, which has been hit with a 50% levy.
Trump said the measures would “make America rich again”, adding that he had been “very kind” in his decisions.

Meloni, a Trump ally, said the EU tariffs would “not suit either party” - referring to the EU and the US - but that she would work towards a deal with the US to “prevent a trade war”.
Her Spanish counterpart Pedro Sánchez said Spain would protect its companies and workers and “continue to be committed to an open world.”
Irish trade minister Simon Harris said he was ready to negotiate with the US, calling it the “best way forward”, while Taoiseach Micheál Martin said Trump’s decision was “deeply regrettable” and benefitted “no-one”.
Outside of the EU, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Americans would end up paying the biggest price for what he called “unjustified tariffs”, but said his government would not impose reciprocal measures.
“We will not join a race to the bottom that leads to higher prices and slower growth”, he added.
Latin America’s biggest economy, Brazil, approved a law in congress on Wednesday - the Economic Reciprocity Law - to counter the 10% tariff imposed by Trump. There was no immediate reaction from the president, but last week Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said his country “cannot stand still” in face of the tariffs.
Shortly after Trump’s announcement, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned countries not to “retaliate” and “sit back, take it in”.",2025-04-03 01:29:20,13,AndroidOne1,worldnews

Historically, it has been my country, the US, that has depleted landscapes, stripping communities of their ability to have robust local economies. Look what US agriculture did to Puerto Rico, turned it from a biodiverse island capable of producing all of it's food needs into a monoculture sugar cane waste field. The agriculture practices that caused the dust bowl of the 1930's and 1940's have spread throughout the globe. 


With the smartest scientists at our disposal we've managed to poison virtually all of our food. Ironically,  my country spent hundreds of years bashing aboriginal practices, when those aboriginal practices lead back to the original four commandments in the garden of eden. The country that processes God on the surface despises the very food forests God had in plan for us.


The world's problems can be partially solved in a food forest. Many of our statutes make real agrofoodforestry illegal to implement.


This will not solve all our problems, but in terms of ensuring no child dies of hunger, and all locales have bartering ability to market unique produce derived from their individual microclimates, we could be doing much better as a species abiding by the fundamental principles of how soil works.

mlfafcj,1jrk796,reddit,"***The Telegraph reports***:

Emmanuel Macron is set to become Europe’s point man to hold talks with Vladimir Putin over peace in Ukraine, The Telegraph can reveal.

Some members of the “coalition of the willing” have pushed for a European leader to take the helm on engaging Russia as part of efforts to support Kyiv.

The French president and Sir Keir Starmer, who lead the group of nations planning to secure any ceasefire deal in Ukraine, have been singled out as the most likely interlocutors with Moscow.

But The Telegraph understands Sir Keir has no plans to hold talks with [Putin](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/04/03/the-longer-the-war-goes-on-the-weaker-putin-becomes/) as part of the UK’s efforts to support Ukraine’s defence.

An Élysée Palace source said Mr Macron was willing to take up the role “when the time is right”.

Mr Macron has positioned himself as Europe’s go-between with Putin since the start of his full-scale invasion.

He opted to leave diplomatic channels open with Moscow longer than any of Europe’s most ardent supporters of Kyiv, despite harsh criticism for his actions.

But he ended any direct contact with the Kremlin when it became obvious to him Putin had no intention of halting his invasion.

Asked whether the time was right to resume contact with the Russian president, the Élysée official told The Telegraph: “Apparently, not yet.”

So far, Donald Trump is the only world leader to engage directly with Putin on the mechanics of a ceasefire deal.

Some in Europe believe the US president has been too lenient on Putin, whom he has often heaped praise on and promised to reset relations with as part of the peace process.

This week, Alexander Stubb, the Finnish president, said Britain and France should take the lead on any talks with Putin.

“My personal preference would be that our representatives of the coalition of the willing would be doing that. In other words, France or the United Kingdom,” he said.

France and Britain are happy to allow Mr Trump’s diplomatic attempts to end the war play out, but have called for further pressure to be applied on Putin to encourage him to come to the negotiating table.

mltbpap,1jtczze,reddit,"From the article:

> In an interview with Belgium’s VRT broadcaster on Thursday, Prime Minister Bart De Wever was asked about Hungary’s decision to not act on the ICC warrant against Netanyahu during the Israeli leader’s visit to Budapest this week.

> “To be completely honest, I don’t think we would either,” De Wever said during the interview.

> “There is such a thing as realpolitik, I don’t think any European country would arrest Netanyahu if he were on their territory. France wouldn’t do it, and I don’t think we would, either.”

> ...

> After the ICC’s decision to issue the warrants, several countries, including Hungary, Argentina, the Czech Republic, Romania, Poland, France, and Italy, have said they would not arrest Netanyahu if he visited.

> US and western intelligence officials do not believe that Russia is interested in negotiating a ceasefire deal with Ukraine in good faith, CNN has reported. Moscow still believes it can sustain its war effort and outlast Ukraine on the battlefield.

>A senior NATO official reiterated that on Thursday, saying that “Russia still believes that time mostly is on its side.”

>“We have had questions for a long time about whether Putin intends to negotiate in good faith,” the official said. Russia is “willing to continue those talks [about mending ties with the US] at the same time that it is delaying and stalling and saying that they can’t accept the US proposals right now, on the actual ceasefire. I think all of that supports the idea that Russia’s goals haven’t changed at all—that right now, what it is trying to do is probably stall for time, make less concessions on the war, and try to instead make progress on sanctions, on Russia’s place in the international community.”

* The Major Federal Project Office would have a ""one project, one review"" mandate to eliminate duplication of federal and provincial environmental assessments and speed up reviews.Summary by Bloomberg AI
* Carney's plan also includes expanding a critical minerals exploration tax credit and developing a trade and energy corridor through a C$5 billion fund to build infrastructure to reach export markets.Summary by Bloomberg A

Prime Minister Mark Carney pledged to make Canada the world’s “leading energy superpower” through a plan that includes establishing a single office that would decide on major projects within two years.The Liberal Party leader said at a campaign stop in Calgary that his government would create a Major Federal Project Office with a “one project, one review” mandate. The aim would be to eliminate duplication of federal and provincial environmental assessments, speeding up reviews.“We are going to aggressively develop projects that are in the national interest in order to protect Canada’s energy security, diversify our trade, and enhance our long-term competitiveness — all while reducing emissions,” Carney said in a statement. “We can lead the energy transition while ensuring affordable energy at home and building the strongest economy in the G-7.”Mark Carney, Canada’s prime minister, speaks during a campaign rally in Calgary on Tuesday.*Photographer: Gavin John/Bloomberg*Canada ships some 4 million barrels of crude a day to the US — the vast majority of its production — and also relies on a pipeline that goes through midwestern states to supply provinces in the east. US President Donald Trump’s threats to Canada’s economy and sovereignty have intensified pressure to accelerate projects that reduce its dependence on the US.Carney Pledges to Speed Permits, Make Canada ‘Energy Superpower’",2025-04-09 23:59:03,1,Acceptable-Pie-7522,worldnews

From a moral and factual standpoint, Russia’s actions in Ukraine—invading a sovereign nation, annexing territory through force, deliberately targeting civilian infrastructure, and spreading systematic disinformation—align with behavior often associated with state terrorism. These actions have been widely condemned by governments, international organizations, and human rights groups.



However, the hesitation in officially designating Russia as a “terrorist state” comes from the legal and diplomatic complexities involved. Many governments, including the U.S., avoid such labels for major powers due to the significant geopolitical consequences, such as limiting diplomatic engagement and economic relations.



So, while the facts of Russia’s actions support the argument that it behaves as a terrorist state, the reluctance to apply the label is largely political rather than factual. If you’re asking for a straightforward answer based on conduct alone, then yes—Russia’s actions are consistent with state terrorism.",2025-03-27 10:12:33,3,FantasyFrikadel,worldnews

Trump tried to con Carney to take his side about how much richer they could all be if Canada was sold to America, like he did with major Canadian Conservatives like Harper, Poilievre and Harper’s last failed Conservative Big Boy, Kevin O’Leary.

It was Carney & Trump’s first official call, Trump started with his bullshit again about selling out Canada and that language was shut down if he wanted to continue the call.

Exactly what Carney promised he would do.

What has Harper, O’Leary & PP done to show they are open to trade talks without compromising Canada? Since it took until April 22, 2025 for PP to publicly release the party’s platform that still doesn’t outline an economic plan taking Trump’s tariffs seriously shows how aligned the party and it’s majority financial backers are with Trump. 

Do you really think the appropriate response was for Carney to tell Trump to get fucked and hang up the call? As much as we want that to happen, that is not at all how you handle major trade disputes or exercise diplomacy. 

He let Trump talk and then shut him down by saying they will continue talks based in agreeing to disagree on Canada joining the world’s richest shit hole, third world country led by billionaires and still can’t even feed children in school or offer accessible health care. Well, he didn’t call out America for being a third world dictatorship. That’s the general consensus of what America is.

That’s 0 in the EU. 0 EU universities are in the top 25 and only 17 are in the top 100. The overwhelming majority of the top 250. universities are all in the IS. Even small cities have multiple schools that rank higher than in the EU. That’s not heresy with poorly academic performing US reject professors from mediocre  schools, that is based on professional rankings by independent sources.

Our unemployed has been so low for the past decade that it is virtually impossible to fill open positions. I’ve had multiple openings for $100k jobs that go unfilled for months. I have no idea where you got the idiotic idea that it’s difficult to get a job in the US. Typical uniformed European idiocy.

US Youth sports participation is overwhelmingly higher than the EU. I don’t know any parents whose  kids don’t participate in at least one sport year round.  US  olympic medal count is overwhelming higher than the EU, we don’t even fund those athletes and most people don’t care about those sports. It also explains why the majority of Europeans are weak, small skinny-fat individuals with no athletic ability and why soccer, a sport for simpletons that our children master by the age of 7, is so popular.

The per capita bike argument is also strange We don’t ride bikes because we’re not poor, we have states that are larger than all of the EU and it can can take hours to drive where I want to go. We do however have a huge fitness culture that doesn’t exist in the EU. Riding your bike 15 minutes across your god forsaken town doesn’t count. And the fact you think a 20 minute walk counts as exercise  explains why your athletes perform so poorly.

I didn’t vote for MAGA but arrogant Europeans like you convince me that we need to stop spending US taxpayer funds and sacrificing American lives to defend Europe. We also don’t need to do business or spend money with the EU.

mnkox49,1k1bnhb,reddit,"Russia escaped unscathed from President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs unveiled earlier this month, but the Kremlin says Moscow is not immune from the economic aftershocks that could ensue in a potential global trade war.

Unlike many U.S. allies who were hit with trade tariffs in Trump’s early-April announcement, Russia was spared new import tariffs when Trump announced his wide-ranging list of new duties to be imposed on imports from more than 180 countries, ostensibly aimed at leveling up the global trading playing field.

Russia was left out, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Axios media outlet, because U.S. sanctions on the country for its invasion of Ukraine in 2022 already precluded “any meaningful trade” between the two nations. CNBC has requested further comment from the White House and is awaiting a response.

>At least 5,700 homes in the city, which was taken by Russia following a long siege in 2022, have been earmarked for potential seizure, according to the report. 

>A complex bureaucratic system that requires the homeowner to report to officials in Mariupol means that many Ukrainian refugees whose homes have been classed as potentially “ownerless” will inevitably find it difficult to claim their property. 

>Earlier this month, a former advisor to Mariupol’s legitimate Ukrainian mayor said that Moscow is planning to settle five million Russians in the territories it occupies in eastern and southern Ukraine. 

>Russia has launched well-documented efforts to “Russify” areas that have come under its control since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine just over three years ago. These efforts include alleged mass abductions of local children and measures aimed at pressuring residents to take up Russian nationality. 

>Having Russian citizenship is also a feature of the process of reclaiming a home suspected of being “ownerless” in Mariupol, according to the BBC’s report. 

>Once officials announce a property as having “signs of being ownerless,” the owner must appear in Mariupol with ownership documents and a Russian passport within 30 days. Other forms of ID may be accepted, though they are not specified by the authorities. 

>If no one claims ownership within the timeframe, the property is declared “ownerless.” After three months, local authorities can request a court ruling to bring it into public ownership. Some 600 flats have been seized so far, the Moscow-installed city mayor said, according to the report. 

>Russia’s President Vladimir Putin issued a decree in March targeting Ukrainian citizens who are yet to take up the offer of Russian nationality. 

>Those who do not sign up before mid-September will be threatened with “deportation,” which may in reality mean transportation to a detention center, according to a recent report by The Kyiv Independent.

Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,  
With conquering limbs astride from land to land;  
Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand  
A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame  
Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name  
Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand  
Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command  
The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.  
  
""Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!"" cries she  
With silent lips. ""Give me your tired, your poor,  
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,  
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.  
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,  
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!""

If China shows that they're not going to resort to aggression for the time being, closer relations could certainly be established.

Under certain circumstances, they could/should work towards a new world order.

But I'm quite unsure how closely China is tied to Russia.

However, the reasoning behind choosing this particular item may actually be much more complicated.*

*The ""fact sheet specifications"" of the M-30 howitzer are not that impressive: required crew is 8 people, rate of fire is 5–6 rounds per minute, maximum firing range is 11.8 kilometers, trunnion height is 1,200 mm, and the allowed towing speed on the highway is up to 50 km/h.*

*However, the Russians may be following a particular calculus in restoring these WW2-era howitzers. By decommissioning old artillery systems, Russian army can obtain the appropriate ""volley mass"" to support its assault groups during offensive operations. The russians might see the shorter firing range and possibly worse barrel durability compared to the D-30 as acceptable drawbacks as long as they can achieve the desired effect.*",2025-04-06 17:42:27,34,Well-Sourced,worldnews

Russia has upgraded its ballistic missiles, making them harder to intercept, as it increases their use in attacks on Ukraine, Air Force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat said on the United News telethon on April 6.

Ukraine shares data on these changes with its Western partners to help them improve their air defense systems.

""Since the beginning of 2024, the enemy has increased the percentage of ballistic missiles, if we take all missiles,"" Ihnat said.

“There are fewer cruise missiles and more ballistic missiles. We understand that ballistic missiles are shot down by the Patriot system.”

The tactics of using enemy drones may also change as the enemy modernizes its equipment. According to Ihnat, since the first use of Shaheds in the fall of 2022, they have undergone changes, including a black color, and have been equipped with new guidance and satellite navigation systems.

The Russian military launched a combined attack on Ukraine with air-, ground-, and sea-based missiles and attack UAVs, according to the Air Force. Russia deployed 132 air attack assets—23 missiles of various types and 109 strike drones, including decoys—across the country, with the air defenses downing 53 targets.

mnm07al,1k1gjae,reddit,">Prominent Trump supporter Erik Prince has agreed to help the Democratic Republic of Congo **secure** and **tax** its vast mineral wealth. According to two sources close to the private security executive, a Congolese government official and two diplomats.

>The agreement, aimed at reaping more revenue from an industry marred by smuggling and corruption, was reached before Rwanda-backed M23 rebels launched a major offensive in January that has seen them seize eastern Congo's two largest cities.

>Discussions now on implementing the deal with Prince come as the US and Congo explore a broader deal on critical minerals partnerships, after Congo pitched a security deal to US President Donald Trump's administration.

>Prince, a former US Navy Seal, founded Blackwater before renaming the private military company and selling it in 2010 after several employees were indicted on charges of unlawfully killing Iraqi civilians. the men were convicted but later pardoned by Trump during his first term.

>The Trump administration has not said how the US might contribute to security in Congo as part of any minerals deal. Analysis and former US officials have said leaning on security contractors could be an option.

>A Congolese government source told Reuters that any agreement between Congo and Prince would need to be reviewed in light of the push for a deal with the US. 

>The security deal was agreed with the finance ministry and Prince's advisers will focus on improving tax collection and reducing cross-border smuggling of minerals, the two sources close to Prince said. There were no plans to deploy security to active conflict areas.

>The initial plan was to deploy contractors to Goma, the capital of North Kivu province and the largest city in eastern Congo. But now it's under M23 control and the plan is on hold.

>A source in the office of Congolese  President Felix Tshisekedi said an agreement in principle has been signed with Prince, but details on where and how many advisers will be deployed remained to be established. Some Prince-controlled companies have operated in Congo since 2015. They have been involved in trucking and have sought to get into the minerals sector.

The poverty figure for the first six months of this year was 52.9%, up from 41.7% in the second half of 2023, said the country's Indec statistics agency.

mmb5fsl,1jv48nw,reddit,"I think this has been the ultimate aim of Trump and his cronies -- to maximize the grift for their own self-benefit. He doesn't care an iota about the issues that rile up his base. He wants to make money, and what better way to do that than with the threat of tariffs moving the entire market at his whim.

Plus, he cleaned out the SEC, CFTC, FINRA, FCA, and every other financial regulator that could've had a chance of standing in the way of this, or at least detecting it after the fact -- and filled them with his allies who are probably getting in on the grift.

We're not talking about them all making a sure-bet 9% on the rise in the market today after the announcement. With creative investing instruments, one could make not only a multiple of that gain, but \*many times\* their original investment. There are people in the Trump orbit who today turned millions into tens, or even hundreds, on millions.

It's actually pretty smart if you don't have a moral compass and seek the maximum financial advantage, consequences on everyone else be damned.

What else really besides tariffs allows the president to move markets -- both upward and down -- at his will, without instituting any permanent policy? Just on his word, they've discovered now that they can basically send the \*entire\* market up or down about 10%. With insider information ahead of time, one could make almost unlimited proceeds betting before the rise or dip.

Using margin leverage and derivatives, they bet on outlier moves in the market, which normally would be very rare, but here they know they're almost certain to happen with such world-shaking announcements.

This, for them, is like walking up to the roulette wheel 98% certain which number it will hit. And like anyone would, they bet accordingly -- and most of them have a lot to start with.",2025-04-10 00:39:06,2,Thewall3333,worldnews

A Danish 11-year-old raised over 34,000 Danish kroner (approximately $4,900) by making beaded Easter chicks to help Ukrainian children who lost their homes during the ongoing war.

Since Russia’s full-scale invasion began, Denmark was a strong supporter of Ukraine, providing billions in military aid, including long-range Harpoon coastal defense missile systems and F-16 fighter jets, significantly enhancing Ukraine’s air and coastal defense capabilities.

Denmark committed approximately DKK 50 billion ($7.2 billion) in military support under the Ukraine Fund from 2023 to 2028. The country was also a pioneer in purchasing weapons directly from the Ukrainian defense industry, supporting Ukraine’s defense production.

Apart from military, Denmark is also involved in sending humanitarian aid and supporting reconstruction efforts in Ukraine.

Jens Fog Thomsen creates and sells beaded Easter chicks in Ukraine’s national blue and yellow colors as his fundraising method, according to Ukraine’s Minister of Economy Yuliia Svyrydenko.

This initiative began after he saw news coverage of Ukrainian children displaced by the war. “What can we do?” Jens asked his mother upon seeing the reports. His mother encouraged him to “create goodness.”

The young philanthropist’s efforts have yielded consistent results. This year alone, he raised 6,000 kroner ($870), which was then doubled to 12,000 ($1,739) by KOLO Nordic, a Danish NGO dedicated to providing direct humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. Last year’s fundraising brought in 28,000 kroner ($4,059).

Denmark’s Minister for Business, Morten Bødskov, met with Jens to acknowledge his contribution. “We ate burger and Jens talked about the great job. This is SO beautiful. I actually have no words for it. 11 years! Hundreds of chickens. Thousands of kroner for Ukrainian children,” Bødskov stated.


Svyrydenko recorded a personal video message thanking Jens and his family, noting that his actions demonstrate that “generosity of spirit has no age.”",2025-03-31 23:43:43,53,Well-Sourced,worldnews

Ukraine has received the latest installment of the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) budget support amounting to $400 million, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on March 31.

The funds represent the latest tranche of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program, which will provide Kyiv with $15.6 billion in budget support over four years. With the additional $400 million in funding, the program has now distributed $10.1 billion in financing to Ukraine.

The IMF's executive board approved the $400 million tranche on March 29 after completing its seventh review of the EFF agreement.

""We are grateful to the Fund... for its assistance and close cooperation in supporting the Ukrainian economy during the war,"" Shmyhal said on X.

""Russia's war in Ukraine continues to take a devastating social and economic toll on Ukraine,"" IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said in a press statement. ""(Ukraine's) economy has remained resilient, but the recent growth slowdown is expected to persist in 2025 due to headwinds from energy needs and a tight labor market. Contingency planning is key to enable appropriate policy action should risks materialize,"" the statement reads.

Commenting on Ukraine's monetary policy, the managing director urged Ukraine's National Bank to ""stand ready for further action"" should inflation expectations deteriorate.

The central bank raised the key policy rate from 14.5% to 15.5% per annum in its most recent change to interest rates. In 2024, inflation in Ukraine exceeded expectations, accelerating to 12%.

Funds from the EFF are intended to help stabilize Ukraine, support the country's postwar recovery, and promote economic growth as Kyiv moves forward on its path to EU membership.

External financing is critical for Ukraine as it faces mounting economic pressure from Russia's full-scale invasion. Kyiv received $42.5 billion in foreign aid last year, and the Finance Ministry has said that the amount needs to increase by at least $12 billion for 2025.",2025-03-31 11:52:35,48,Well-Sourced,worldnews

Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) has dismantled another Russian military intelligence spy ring operating in Kyiv, detaining three alleged collaborators, including one Russian citizen, the agency reported on March 31.

According to investigators, the group's main mission was to help coordinate Russian airstrikes on Ukraine’s capital.

""The enemy’s primary targets were defense factories and warehouses storing weapons and ammunition for Ukraine’s Armed Forces,"" the SBU said in a statement.

Although the agents operated independently, the investigation revealed they all reported to a single handler — an officer with Russia’s military intelligence agency, the GRU — whose identity has already been confirmed by Ukrainian counterintelligence.

The Russian national had been living in Ukraine in so-called ""sleeper mode"" and was activated by Russian military intelligence after the full-scale invasion began in 2022, the SBU said.

He allegedly set up an observation post on the roof of a high-rise residential building in Kyiv to help guide Russian missile strikes. According to the investigation, the agent gained access to the building’s rooftop by leveraging a personal relationship with a member of the building’s homeowners association, who had keys to all technical areas.

The other two suspects are a current and former employee of Ukrainian defense companies. One of them allegedly gathered information on the aftermath of Russian missile strikes, the number of workers present at factories and repair bases, and other sensitive details. The other reportedly “unknowingly” extracted information from his former colleagues about the locations of potential targets.

All three suspects have been formally charged.

According to the SBU, they face charges under Part 2 of Article 111 (high treason under martial law), Part 3 of Article 114-2 (unauthorized dissemination of information on the movement or location of Ukraine’s Armed Forces), and Parts 1 and 3 of Article 436-2 (justifying or denying Russia’s armed aggression against Ukraine).

Two of the suspects are being held without bail. Prosecutors have filed a motion in court to detain the third.",2025-03-31 11:13:43,37,Well-Sourced,worldnews

U.S. President Donald Trump's spiritual advisor, Pastor Mark Burns, arrived in Ukraine and visited cities in Kyiv Oblast liberated from Russian forces in 2022, Chief Rabbi of Ukraine Moshe Azman said on March 31.  

Azman invited Burns to visit Bucha, Borodianka, and Irpin. Three years ago, Russia's attempts to encircle Kyiv failed after more than a month of heavy fighting, with Moscow's troops retreating from the capital's outskirts.

Hundreds of residents of the three towns were found to have been tortured, raped, and executed by the Russian army.

""The war in Ukraine is bigger than Democrats or Republicans, the Left or the Right. Whether you dislike President Trump or President (Volodymyr) Zelensky, real people are dying here,"" Burns said on X.

Reflecting on his trip to Kyiv Oblast, Burns listed Russian war crimes, including deported children and raped women, executions of civilians and destruction of multiple churches.

Ukraine's top religious leaders also told him about Russia's systematic religious persecution.

""Yet despite these horrors, Ukraine stands strong as a beacon of religious freedom, welcoming all faiths,"" Burns said.

The pastor said that Ukrainian soldiers on the front line ""are not asking for money"" but for more weapons and fighter jets ""to shoot down the drones that still fire at civilian buildings, and killing people.""

Ukraine has agreed to a U.S.-proposed full 30-day ceasefire, saying on March 11 that Kyiv is ready to take such a step if Russia also agrees to the terms. So far, Russia has refused, instead attempting to extract major concessions from the U.S. in exchange for partial ceasefire agreements.

Mark Burns is a televangelist and pastor of Harvest Praise & Worship Center in South Carolina. He supported Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election and was labeled by Time Magazine as ""Donald Trump's Top Pastor.""

""Pastor Burns is a man who has the ability to be heard where big decisions are made. And I believe that the voice of truth from Ukraine will be brought to the heart of the new U.S. leadership,"" Azman said.",2025-03-31 11:44:28,52,Well-Sourced,worldnews

The politico article seems to imply that these are conscripts for the fighting in Ukraine but as far as I'm aware that would be pretty big news because the vast majority of the Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine itself are volunteers not conscripts and the Kremlin has been wary of using too many general conscripts due to potential backlash.",2025-03-31 19:37:32,25,socialistrob,worldnews

When a country can't sell their product where they planned to, they will offload it to someone else for cheap in order to at least recoup some of their cost. This will lead to other countries needing to put in place temporary tariffs to stop dumping from impacting their local companies.

We may see examples like this targeting other industries as well. American farmers who can no longer sell food to China will start looking at other markets to offload the food they've grown, as even selling them below cost is preferable to letting the food rot. However, if a country lets American farmers flood their market with below cost food, local companies cannot compete, which is why anti-dumping policies will need to be put in place.",2025-04-21 17:52:54,159,Consistent-Study-287,worldnews

I think this is it. The surge in russian tank supply is over and the last dregs are coming through the repair plants.

Russia still has hulls to reactivate, but all the good stuff is gone so now they will take much longer.

In Ukraine, it isn’t just professional soldiers who are standing up to the enemy. They have been joined by countless civilians who have donned military uniform: drivers and doctors, managers and engineers, accountants and construction workers...

This is brought home when you hear the story of Nataliia Hrabarchuk, a former kindergarten teacher who shot down a Russian missile.

On 17 November 2024, Russia conducted yet another large-scale air attack on Ukraine, deploying 90 drones and 120 missiles of various types: Zircons, Iskanders, Kinzhals... Ukraine’s air defence forces – anti-aircraft missile troops, F-16, Su and MiG pilots, mobile fire groups and electronic warfare units – managed to destroy 140 aerial targets that day.

One of those targets, a Kh-101 cruise missile, was shot down by Nataliia Hrabarchuk, an anti-aircraft gunner in the missile unit of the 1st Halychyna and Volhynia Radio Technical Brigade of Air Command Zakhid (West). You may have already seen the video of her perfect shot on social media. It shows Nataliia standing on the roof of a building with an Igla man-portable air defence system (MANPADS) on her shoulder. Seconds later, the missile hurtles into the sky, a curved path of white smoke trailing behind it. Nataliia kneels to put down the launch tube and joins her hands together as if in silent prayer. Then there is an explosion.

""Did you get it?"" the other women ask each other. Then, when they are sure, they shout joyfully: ""You got it! Natasha, you got it!""

Briefing #1: EU Won't Lift Sanctions On Russia -- Yet

As one EU ambassador put it to me, referring to the recent cease-fire talks in Riyadh: ""No deal was made on this in Saudi Arabia, so therefore nothing to decide for us.""

lifting EU sectoral sanctions requires unanimity, and that simply doesn't exist right now. As noted above, many member states are calling for more sanctions, not fewer. But here's the catch: Every six months, in January and July, the entire sanctions package must be extended -- and that also requires unanimous approval.

It is here where Hungary, and potentially others, might want to come in and start scaling down

Briefing #2: Rubio Comes To Brussels

When Rubio was first slated for the role in the new Trump administration, most Europeans rejoiced. He was seen as an ardent ""transatlanticist.""

Now, there is a certain nervousness, according to NATO diplomats I have spoken to.

While some say, ""He still gets us and the alliance,"" they wonder what influence he really has within the US government and what he will say when it comes to Ukraine, Russia, and China.

Just one day before the NATO meeting, the United States is set to impose a 25 percent tariff on all vehicle imports, a move that will hit countries like Germany especially hard. This follows existing US duties on European steel and aluminum, which Brussels is planning to counter with retaliatory measures on April 13.",2025-04-01 10:35:42,32,ReadToW,worldnews

[OPINION: Belgorod In Focus, Defensive Drills With Drones, Balanced Attacks | Kyiv Post](https://www.kyivpost.com/opinion/49993)

**Sumy**

*To the west, it appears the Russians pushed a counterraid into Ukraine’s Sumy region around the villages of Zhuravtsy and Novenky. This looks less like a major operation and more like a reinforced foot incursion, but reports aren’t clear. The Ukrainians are saying they stopped it cold and killed Russians. Maybe. What is clear is that reinforcements, at least one sizable Ukrainian infantry unit, got deployed there towards the end of the week.*

**Belgorod**

*In neighboring Belgorod region, the new Ukrainian invasion into Russia – which we flagged two weeks ago – seems to be possibly expanding a bit, but mostly digging in and then chewing up what the Russians are throwing at it. Russian sources say the Ukrainians have invaded with a force of about 4,000 men. They primarily are moving on foot, as infiltrators, but armored units are making raid-type attacks as well.*

*Video has surfaced of Ukrainian engineers cutting gaps through Russian dragons’ teeth on the border and combat vehicles moving through. The heart of the Ukrainian position is still around the village of Demidovka. Mainstream Western media is saying this is a 3-to-4-kilometer (1.9-to-2.5-mile) penetration into Russian defenses.*

*Basically, we spotted this more than a week ago. The primary Ukrainian units involved seem to be, mostly, forces pulled from the Kursk incursion. The list includes 225th Separate Assault Regiment, 47th Mech Brigade (these are the ZSU’s two main Bradley operators), 33rd Assault Regiment, 24th Assault Battalion (i.e., the current military version of the 2014-15-era Aidar volunteer group), and the Russian Volunteer Corps (RDK).*

*Taken together, these are all proven attack units, but they are nothing like a proper, well-rounded combat brigade or two. This is a pretty textbook example of Ukrainian hodge-podge operations. Up to you to decide if that’s because the generals in Kyiv decided these particular units had just the right skill sets and aggressiveness for this particular operation, or if it was just grabbing available units.*

*Also in the area, and clearly at times operating behind the Russian lines, are special ops teams from HUR and the SSO. There is some pretty strong evidence that some of them are carrying laser designators, as we can strongly suspect the Ukrainian air force has put in some very precise bomb on targets in the Russian rear area that normally wouldn’t be that accurate, unless somehow the Ukrainians had a way to guide the bomb in.*

*The teeth of this operation are very clearly the 414th Unmanned Aircraft Brigade, whom most of you will recognize as our old friends, Ptakhi Madyara. Unit information feeds (Commander Robert Brovdi) report a very target-rich environment and many kills and that we have to wait for video because of security. Russians report a brutal Ukrainian drone presence. Image of a Ukrainian drone flown by the SSO, zeroing in on a Russian truck modified to be an armored troop transporter, Belgorod sector. Probably this was a crew for a BM-21 rocket artillery battery being sent to deal with the Ukrainian incursion.*

*There are unconfirmed reports that the Ukrainians have positioned three powerful conventional units (22nd and 61st Mechanized and 17th Heavy Mechanized) brigades in the area but I’m not clear what they’re up to.*

**Kupyansk**

*One of the bigger Russian attacks of the week was a battle in the Kupyansk sector, 77th Airmobile Brigade was defending.*

*On Friday, they published video and claims saying that after staying quiet for three weeks, the Russians hit Ukrainian positions with artillery, mortars, multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS), dumps, first-person view (FPV) drones, and Russian glider bombs (KABs), and after four hours of bombardment pushed 16 armored vehicles out into the open, at about midday. The bombardment either missed or hit strong fortifications, but in any case, the 77th was able to drop mines in the column’s path, call in its own artillery, mortars, and drones, and once the column was stopped and the Russian infantry went to ground, the FPV drones moved in to hunt down survivors.*

*The Russians fell back, no ground gained. Estimated Russian losses: 60 dead, 28 wounded, 12 light armored vehicles, and one tank destroyed. The main source is a battalion commander talking on the unit information feed but the Khortytsia Group of Forces confirmed the action as well.*

*Here’s a link to a smaller fight. This morning, 72nd Mech Brigade claimed five Russian vehicles were destroyed, 26 men killed, and 33 wounded. The tactics are exactly the same: wait for the Russians to come out into the open, stop the column with drones, mines and artillery, then finish off survivors with drones. It seems 59th Shock, 35th Mech and 414th Drone (this is Ptakhi Madyara again) also were in on the fighting.*

**Pokrovsk**

*In separate stats, the 414th said its pilots operating in the Pokrovsk sector recorded on March 27: 192 successful drone strikes, including 28 destroyed vehicles and 60 Russian soldiers killed or seriously wounded. Image from one of the strikes.*

*Also, over the week, it appears local Ukrainian attacks have taken ground back from the Russians to the south-west of Pokrovsk near a village called Kotlyne.*

*The main objectives appear to be to gain ground and eventually cut off the cities of Pokrovsk and Kostiantynivka – these are both long-term goals that the Russians have been pushing towards for months. From what I gather, about 10 square kilometers (3.9 square miles) were gained to the south of Kostiantynivka, but along the other 99% of the line in that sector, the Russians made no progress. There were plenty of reports of attempted Russian assaults that failed. Most appear to have been infantry moving in light vehicles, a few were proper combined arms assaults.*

**Toretsk**

*The most visible and easy-to-document Ukrainian success came from the Toretsk sector where, for those of you who like to recall such things, the Ukrainians supposedly were defeated and kicked out of the town about two months ago. Then it turned out that the Russians were exaggerating a bit, then it turned out that actually, the Ukrainians were hanging on to the western edge of Toretsk, and then it became pretty obvious that actually, there was a nasty fight going on, house-to-house, inside the city. In the past ten days, the Ukrainians clearly have gained ground, but it’s just as clearly ruined buildings still under heavy Russian fire.*

*Here’s what a Ukrainian officer-blogger says of the situation in Toretsk: ”In Toretsk, frankly, it’s a big mess in the city. Either we or the f*ckers are pushing for positions, houses are changing hands, it is difficult in such a situation to put something together and talk about a specific situation.”*

*On Thursday, March 27, a unit we know well and that is in the sector, 12th National Guard Brigade a/k/a Azov, announced its offensive operations around Toretsk were proceeding well, and as proof, published video and images of 20 recently-captured Russian prisoners of war, including a lieutenant. By the standards of this war, 20 POWs captured in a single battle is a lot. Units defeated by Azov seem to be mostly elements of Russia’s 9th Motor Rifle Brigade and a few men from the 20th Motor Rifle Regiment. The soldiers mostly said they were from central or western Siberia, which matched those two formations. Irkutsk, Chita, Tiumen, Perm – places like that. Some from Cheliabinsk. Zero from west Russia and/or big western cities like Krasnodar, Moscow, or Petersburg.*

*Azov is one of the best-trained and most-disciplined units in the entire ZSU, and if there is a more aggressive one, I don’t know it. The easiest explanation is that Azov recon found an isolated platoon of Russians and 12th Brigade staff put together an operation to surround them. This is something you expect a professional infantry brigade to do day in/day out. In the ZSU, this is (still) rare. But in any case, the capture probably happened, and the POW video I think is real.*

*The 100th Mech Brigade today posted a video, another POW, 130th Regiment, also from Toretsk sector.*

*Russian video says that 150th Guards Division is attacking in Toretsk. They are supposed to be a better unit, not least because by pedigree they are the guys that took the Reichstag.*


*I’ve also stuck a link from Ukraine’s 28th Mech Brigade trying to defend themselves with shotguns – also Toretsk sector. Drone terror is real. Getting hyper about hearing buzzing in the air somewhere is a real thing on both sides of the lines.*",2025-04-02 00:04:56,27,Well-Sourced,worldnews

Russia has been very supportive of US control over Greenland. 

I'm not convinced this is the case but it would explain a lot.

The army guys would also do depraved things to the cows, like holding them down and cutting their legs off, rather than slaughtering them, which was traumatic for everyone who had raised that livestock. 

My Aunt and Uncle knew that if they left, their workers would probably be killed. So they stayed until my Aunt found new jobs for every last worker. On the last day, the army machine gunned out every window in their house, with their teenage daughter cowering inside. After that, they knew they had to leave. They managed to grab a few things and left everything behind for Australia. 

The sad thing was that the workers could have continued to keep the entire farm running without my aunt and uncle, AND they actually would have happily handed it over to them. But because the farm workers were treated as traitors, these massive farms just became dormant after the workers escaped for their safety. The whole situation was so sad.",2025-04-12 05:57:42,297,Damn_Canadian,worldnews

After the brits pulled out in 1980 the zimbabwe government had the right to take back that land. Those farms we're propped up by a colonial rule. And the land was unfairly distributed as to provide wealth by race.


I may not agree with the way that they did it, but they had the right to take it. That land was stolen and protected under colonial role until 1980 and a further ten years until 1990 under the agreements the british made contingent to give zimbabwe it's freedom.

The law - as is pointed out here to be followed - was created by the colonial rule that extended even after they left.

>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will travel to Hungary on April 2 despite an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC), his office reportedly said Sunday.

>He is expected to meet with his Hungarian counterpart, Viktor Orbán, as well as other high-level Hungarian officials before going back to Israel on April 6.

>Netanyahu is targeted by an ICC arrest warrant charging him with war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip. According to Le Monde, Hungary considers it doesn’t have to abide by ICC decisions.

>The war in Gaza was triggered by the attack by Hamas on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, when the militant group killed about 1,200 people and abducted 251. Since then, the Israeli offensive has killed more than 50,000 people in Gaza and displaced more than 90 percent of the area’s population.

>On March 18, a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas ended when the Israeli armed forces resumed airstrikes and land incursions. The three mediators — Egypt, Qatar and the United States — are working to secure another deal as well as the freeing of Israeli hostages held in Gaza.

>On Saturday, Hamas said it had accepted a new ceasefire plan proposed by the mediators. Israel, however, has made a counter-proposal.

>An Israeli strike reportedly killed eight people including five children on Sunday, on the first day of Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan.",2025-03-30 16:07:36,-3,BubsyFanboy,worldnews

“The Harpies are a space for women who seek revenge against the enemy, who want to protect their children, their families, and their country using unmanned and robotic systems,” the Drone Systems Forces said in a statement.

Those accepted into the unit will undergo 45 days of basic military training, followed by more than 30 days of specialized instruction. Additional time will be allocated for crew coordination before deployment.

Pilots in the unit will be trained to operate FPV drones, heavy bombers, strike UAVs such as wing-type drones, and ground-based robotic platforms. The Harpies are open to both active-duty servicewomen and reservists.",2025-04-02 17:03:19,39,Well-Sourced,worldnews

Ukrainian drone operators from the Phoenix border unit thwarted a Russian assault by destroying an enemy tank and two infantry fighting vehicles.

Drone operators of the Pomsta brigade repelled an enemy assault in Donetsk Oblast, destroying several enemy armored vehicles. The State Border Guard Service of Ukraine reported this on Wednesday, April 2.

""In the Donetsk sector, the occupiers attempted to storm the positions of Ukrainian defenders but were stopped by pilots from the Phoenix border unit,"" the statement reads.

As seen in the video released by its fighters, several precise FPV drone strikes and bomber drops turned the Russian invaders' armored vehicles into scrap metal.

Ukrainian drone operators from the Phoenix unit also delivered a devastating strike on enemy logistics in the Kupiansk sector.

90% of cannon barrels for Caesar, the wheeled self-propelled howitzer produced by Franco-German defense group KNDS, are currently being delivered to Ukraine, Le Monde reports. The Caesar is among the primary artillery systems used by the Ukrainian military. The rise in output reflects a major shift in French defense manufacturing, especially in the Bourges region in central France.

Bourges reindustrialized after long-term decline. Bourges lost nearly 3,000 industrial jobs between 1991 and 2001 due to site closures by GIAT, KNDS’s predecessor. Local officials such as Mayor Yann Galut and Bourges Plus president Irène Félix acknowledged the dramatic shift in fortunes. “We are living through an extraordinary turning point,” Galut told Le Monde.

Before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, KNDS produced just two Caesar units per month, according to Le Monde. That number has since tripled to six, with a goal of reaching twelve monthly by the end of 2025. Additionally, KNDS has doubled production of 155 mm artillery shells at its La Chapelle-Saint-Ursin facility, targeting 100,000 units per year.

Additionally, Bourges-based facilities of another arms producer, MBDA, have significantly accelerated its output of Mistral and Aster anti-air missiles, which are also supplied to Ukraine.

Beyond MBDA and KNDS, major defense firms like Thales, Safran, Mecachrome, and Michelin have ramped up operations, supported by over 100 subcontractors across the region.",2025-04-22 12:28:56,52,Well-Sourced,worldnews

>Vladimir Putin has offered to halt his invasion of Ukraine across the current front line as part of efforts to reach a peace deal with US President Donald Trump, according to people familiar with the matter.

>The Russian president told Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy, during a meeting in St Petersburg earlier this month that Moscow could relinquish its claims to areas of four partly occupied Ukrainian regions that remain under Kyiv’s control, three of the people said.

>The US has since floated ideas for a possible settlement that includes Washington recognising Russian ownership of Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula, the people added, as well as at least acknowledging the Kremlin’s de facto control over the parts of the four regions it currently holds.

>The proposal is the first formal indication Putin has given since the war’s early months three years ago that Russia could step back from its maximalist demands to end the invasion.

>But European officials briefed on US efforts to end the war cautioned that Putin would probably use the apparent concession as bait to lure Trump into accepting Russia’s other demands and forcing them on Ukraine as a fait accompli.

>“There is a lot of pressure on Kyiv right now to give up on things so Trump can claim victory,” one of them said.  
Ukrainian officials are due to meet European and US officials in London on Wednesday to discuss the latest proposals. However, Witkoff and US secretary of state Marco Rubio have pulled out of the meeting, according to US and European officials. Trump’s Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg is still expected to attend. Putin’s foreign policy adviser said on Tuesday that Witkoff would visit Moscow later this week, according to Russian newswires.

>The US floated ideas the White House hopes could form the outlines of a possible deal at a meeting in Paris last week with European and Ukrainian officials. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Tuesday that he had not received a proposal from Trump outlining specific steps towards ending Russia’s war. But he said that once a ceasefire was in place, he would be ready for direct talks with Putin.

>Senior Ukrainian officials told the FT that they were amenable to some of the ideas floated by Trump and his team without specifying which in particular. The US proposals include deploying a European peacekeeping contingent in Ukraine as well as a separate, non-Nato military force to help monitor a ceasefire along a demilitarised zone spanning the entirety of the more than 1,000km frontline.

>Under a potential deal, Ukraine would pledge not to retake Russian-occupied territory by force, while Russia would agree to halt its army’s slow advance.

>It is unclear whether Trump has asked Ukraine to formally recognise Russia’s annexation of Crimea. But Zelenskyy reiterated his position on the Black Sea peninsula on Tuesday, saying that: “Ukraine will not recognise the occupation of Crimea. It’s our territory, the territory of the people of Ukraine, there is nothing to discuss here.”

>Russia has also rejected some of the US suggestions, including a military presence for Nato countries in Ukraine.

>But people familiar with the matter said Putin would potentially be prepared to give ground on his previous demand for full control over the four frontline Ukrainian regions — Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia — if the US made broader geopolitical concessions to Moscow, such as recognising its control of Crimea and barring Ukraine from joining Nato.

Russia launched 54 attack drones against Ukraine overnight on 22 April, damaging civilian infrastructure in both Odesa and Kyiv regions, according to Ukrainian military and regional officials, and injuring three civilians.

The Ukrainian Air Force reported that the attack began at 9:00 p.m. on 21 April, with drones launched from multiple locations in Russia, including Millerovo, Kursk, Bryansk, Primorsko-Akhtarsk, and from Chauda in occupied Crimea.

According to the report, Ukrainian defenses successfully shot down 38 Shahed-type attack drones across eastern, northern, southern, and central parts of the country. Another 16 Russian drones disappeared from radar without causing damage, the Air Force added.

The Air Force’s data suggest none of the drones reached their intended targets, and the damage was likely caused by falling debris from those intercepted.

Russian drones struck a densely populated residential area in Odesa late on 21 April, causing fires and injuring civilians, according to reports from the State Emergency Service, Mayor Hennadiy Trukhanov, and regional head Oleh Kiper.

The attack damaged civilian infrastructure, residential buildings, an educational institution, and vehicles. Multiple apartments were damaged in the strike, Trukhanov wrote.

Emergency responders, including rescuers, volunteers, National Guard fire units, and Odesa City Council personnel, worked to extinguish the fires.

According to preliminary information, three people were injured in the attack, Kiper reported.

Kyiv Oblast Governor Mykola Kalashnyk reported that air defense systems were active in the region and successfully intercepted several Russian targets. No injuries were reported among the civilian population, and critical infrastructure remained undamaged.

In the Bucha district, the attack damaged six detached houses, four vehicles, three outbuildings, and three garages. A fire also broke out at a construction site, which has since been extinguished. A suburban complex facility was also damaged.

The Ukrainian Air Force warned that a new wave of Russian drone attacks began at 8:00 a.m. on today, with groups of attack drones entering Ukraine from the north through Sumy Oblast.

*Law enforcement officials said the man’s pro-Russian views, shared in Telegram comment threads, attracted the attention of Russian intelligence operatives.*

*The suspect, a resident of a frontline village in northern Sumy Oblast, allegedly provided Russian forces with intelligence on the locations and movements of Ukraine’s Armed Forces.

Operators from Ukraine’s Unmanned Systems Forces (UUSF) tasked with detecting and intercepting Russian unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) reported via the WU Samurai Telegram channel that they had discovered a weakness in the way Russian Molniya drones operated. This allowed them to direct attacks against the enemy operators of the drones on the ground at the same time as they were destroying the UAVs.

The story was reported in the Ukrainian Militarniy website, which said the UUSF team only shared it after their Russian counterparts worked out how the Ukrainians were doing it. Even so, they didn’t divulge the technical details of the tactic other than to say it involved bringing a “small radio reconnaissance device” close to the enemy drone, carried on their own interceptor, as it homed in on the Molniya.

Once the “data” had been extracted, this provided the coordinates of the Russian drone operators control post, by which a Ukrainian first-person view (FPV) kamikaze drone was tasked to take them out.

According to the Ukrainian fighters, each time the destruction of a Molniya UAV was reported, the Russian pilots had also invariably been eliminated – or as they put it: “lightning struck twice.”",2025-04-03 11:17:27,43,Well-Sourced,worldnews

A US Army light tactical vehicle, reportedly never mentioned in official aid packages, has been spotted among Ukrainian armed forces.

Originally developed by Flyer Defense for the US military’s Ultra Light Combat Vehicle program and used by US Special Operations Forces, the Flyer 72-LD ground vehicle appeared in an official video shared by Ukraine’s 6th Ranger Regiment.

Several media outlets speculated that it was part of a classified equipment transfer to Kyiv, as the vehicle is designed for irregular warfare and covert operations. 

According to United24 Media, it is not widely used even among NATO forces. 

The total number in service with Ukrainian forces, along with details of its delivery, remains undisclosed.

The Flyer 72-LD measures 194 inches (4.9 meters) in length and 72 inches (1.8 meters) in width, with an adjustable height.

Depending on the configuration, it can accommodate around 20 personnel, including stretchers for wounded soldiers. 

Weighing 5,000 pounds (2,267 kilograms) and capable of carrying a payload equal to its own weight, the Flyer 72-LD can be transported by UH-60 Black Hawk, CH-47 Chinook, and CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopters.

It can also reportedly be carried by the Soviet-era Mi-8 helicopter, which Kyiv uses to resupply forces in its conflict with Russia, though significant specialized training is required. 

Its lightweight design, combined with the ability to operate in rugged terrain at speeds of up to 75 miles (120 kilometers) per hour, makes it suitable for rapid deployment.

This would not be the first time the US has secretly delivered defense equipment to Ukraine.

During the later years of the war, Washington’s transfer of long-range ATACMS to Kyiv was initially kept under wraps before US State Department spokesman Vedant Patel confirmed it in April 2024. 

Also in 2024, Shield AI covertly sent a small batch of V-BAT drones to be tested for combat use in Ukraine, and announced in January 2025 that Ukraine’s Unmanned Systems Forces had begun operating the systems.",2025-04-03 23:57:43,39,Well-Sourced,worldnews

mn3ozq2,1jyq21j,reddit,"That UK intelligence update on casualties is damning for Russia. They estimate 138k Russian casualties in 2025 which is a rate of 1340 per day. If that rate continues for the entire year that would mean Russia would sustain 489,000 casualties in 2025. I usually don't like to draw straight linear lines and extrapolate but I think there is a good chance the Russian casualties are in the 400-500k range unless something major changes.

Overall Russia NEEDS to be on the offensive to keep the narrative that they are an unstoppable force so they can't afford to quit attacking which would lower their casualty rate. Additionally they also got a huge surge of volunteers recently so they probably don't feel the need to be particularly conservative either especially when battlefield successes can be used to reinforce their narrative in western capitols. We have seen US aid declining and it will likely continue to decline before ending entirely but at the same time European manufacturing of weapons will be world's ahead of where it was in 2021 by this summer meanwhile Ukraine can now produce millions of drones per year. It's now feasible for Ukraine to send multiple drones at individual advancing Russian troops. At the same time Russian armor is becoming rarer and rarer so Russian assaults are becoming more infantry heavy. Less armor means less of an ability to keep infantry alive and the pressure on supply lines means it's harder to get necessary resupply to them. If the US is not committed to European security then Ukraine becomes more important as a replacement for the US so European countries are unlikely to stop arming Ukraine either. As long as Russian demands equate to ""near total Ukrainian surrender"" and Russia is not having a lot of battlefield success then Ukraine has no incentive to accept those demands. What follows is lots of hard fighting with lots of Russian casualties. Both total and partial victory seem to remain on the table for both Ukraine and Russia.",2025-04-14 18:19:26,55,socialistrob,worldnews

Spanish defense company Tecnove has signed an agreement with Ukraine’s Practika Research and Production Association to launch the production of Djura and Kozak armored vehicles at the manufacturing site in Herencia, Spain. The announcement was noticed by Infodefensa.

While the broader terms of the deal remain confidential, this partnership represents a rather extraordinary example of cooperation between Spanish and Ukrainian manufacturers.

Under the agreement, production in Spain will cover three versions of the Djura and Kozak vehicles: standard personnel carrier, ambulance, and configured for special forces.

Tecnove describes Djura as a highly adaptable platform for harsh conditions, while Kozak is characterized by its strong protection, mobility, and suitability for a wide range of tactical missions.

Before concluding the deal with Practika, Tecnove had already invested in expanding its production capabilities in Herencia, suggesting a long-term investment in the project. Besides, this is Spain’s second international armored vehicle co-production deal in 2025. The first came in February, when the EM&E Group signed with NIMR to produce EDGE Group's JAIS 6x6 vehicles at a plant in Linares.

From a broader perspective, Defense Express notes that the Praktika–Tecnove agreement may serve as a precedent for Ukraine’s defense industry to further integrate into Western markets, even though the contract details remain largely undisclosed for now.

Worth noting, Spain has been transferring locally produced VAMTAC armored vehicles as military aid to Ukrainian forces, the specifics of these transfers also remain largely classified.",2025-04-14 16:18:02,34,Well-Sourced,worldnews

A Russian “double agent”, tasked with killing Ukrainian Armed Forces commanders at the Yavoriv training ground, was arrested, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) reported on April 14.

The military counterintelligence unit, with the assistance of the AFU Commander-in-Chief, detained the double agent in Lviv Oblast, SBU’s press service wrote.

The suspect was reportedly working simultaneously for the FSB and Russian military intelligence (GRU).

The investigation showed that the suspect was employed as an instructor at the Yavoriv training ground.

“His assignment from the GRU was to prepare terrorist attacks against Ukrainian commanders undergoing military training at the local Defense Forces center,” the SBU reported.

The agent allegedly received a “carte blanche” from his handler to choose the method of execution.

“Under one of the ‘scenarios’, the traitor was to assemble an improvised explosive device (IED) and secretly plant it in the headquarters or a training building,"" the officers wrote.

""Another plan involved tricking a colleague into unknowingly carrying a disguised explosive to a location where the commanders were present.”

Another method considered by the alleged infiltrator involved a Russian missile strike, using coordinates of exact place where Ukrainian forces gathered at the training ground.

The SBU caught the agent while he was preparing proposals for the assassination plots to be sent to his handler.

During the investigation, the SBU uncovered direct contact between the suspect and an FSB handler. On his orders, the agent gathered information on the number and types of units training at the Yavoriv base.

The man has been formally charged under Part 2 of Article 111 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine — high treason committed during martial law. He is now held in custody without bail, and if convicted, faces life imprisonment with confiscation of property.",2025-04-14 16:07:10,27,Well-Sourced,worldnews

That does not change the fact that IDF has conducted this war precisely and with the intent of protecting civilian lives, doing so in the most difficult possible situation. IDF set the gold standard for protection of civilians in an urban combat zone according to the UN and Hamas Ministry of Health numbers, achieving a 1.3 civilian to 1 combatant death rate compared to the UNs stated average of 9 to 1. They evacuate civilians and give warnings before attacking, ensured relief aid deliveries up until very recently despite Hamas stealing practically all of it and eating like kings throughout this war, vaccinate the civilians, all things no Arab army ever has or ever would do.

War crimes are evil, but they happen in every war, and Hamas' hands are filthy in this regard.

Key takeaways:

* The Kremlin appears to be increasingly concerned with the Russian military's ability to retain forces in the event of demobilization following a ceasefire or a negotiated peace.
* Russian milbloggers expressed doubts that the Russian MoD will be able to retain the current size of the Russian military if the Russian MoD does not promise — and honor — increased financial benefits. 
* The Kremlin and some Russian federal subjects are continuing to increase financial incentives and expand eligibility requirements for contract military service.
* Some Russian federal subjects are failing to meet the Kremlin's recruitment targets as the Russian volunteer recruitment system continues to suffer from high recruitment costs and other inefficiencies.
* Some Russian federal subjects may be failing to meet recruitment targets because they are unable to compete with financial incentives offered in other federal subjects.
* Putin signed a decree on April 21 exempting select volunteers who fought in Ukraine in volunteer units or Kremlin proxy forces from being conscripted into the Russian military, likely as part of the Kremlin's effort to centralize control over informal volunteer units.
* The Kremlin is continuing to expand the ""Time of Heroes"" Higher School of Public Administration Program across occupied Ukraine, likely in an effort to raise a new class of loyal occupation officials.
* Russian milbloggers criticized Russian state media after it published a video of Russian long-range drone operators conducting a drone strike from a high-rise in Moscow City.
* Russia reportedly developed a new version of the ""Kometa"" navigation chip, enhancing the resistance of Russian satellite navigation signals against Ukrainian electronic warfare (EW).
* On April 16, Putin awarded the honorific ""Guards"" titles to four Russian motorized rifle regiments, an aviation regiment, and an army corps that have fought in Donetsk and Kherson oblasts.",2025-04-24 04:22:17,49,Glavurdan,worldnews

Ukrainian pilots flying Western fighter jets F-16 and Mirage shot down several dozen Russian aerial targets during a combined large-scale Russian attack on the night of 23-24 April.

Colonel Yurii Ihnat, Head of the Communications Department of the Ukrainian Air Force Command, on the national joint 24/7 newscast. ""The commander of the Air Force praised the work of our tactical aircraft. In particular, F-16 and Mirage pilots delivered quite good results today: several dozen aerial targets were shot down by our Ukrainian pilots. These included cruise missiles and Shahed drones.

Of course, both Mirage and F-16 aircraft, as well as the still-used Soviet-era fleet, can shoot down targets flying on aerodynamic trajectories – these are cruise missiles and drones. Unfortunately, aircraft cannot intercept ballistic missiles, which is why our Patriot system handles them.""

Ihnat added that the effectiveness of Western aircraft in repelling Russian air attacks is quite high.

On the night of 23-24 April, Russian forces launched 215 missiles of various types and drones on Ukraine, with the main impact falling on the city of Kyiv. Ukrainian air defence units shot down 112 Russian aerial targets, namely 7 Iskander-M/KN-23 ballistic missiles, 31 Kh-101 cruise missiles, 6 Kalibr missiles, 4 Kh-59/Kh-69 air-to-surface missiles and 64 Shahed loitering munitions.",2025-04-24 11:11:58,33,Well-Sourced,worldnews

Russian attacks against Ukraine killed 13 people and injured at least 97 others over the past day, regional authorities said on April 24.

Ukrainian forces downed 64 out of the 145 Shahed-type drones and other drones, as well as 48 out of the 70 missiles, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Russia used ballistic missiles of the Iskander-M or the North Korean KN-23 model, Kh-101 cruise missiles, Kalibr missiles, and Kh-59/Kh-69 missiles. 68 drones disappeared from radars without causing any damage, according to the statement. Drones that disappear from radars before reaching their targets are usually decoys. Russia launches them alongside real drones to overwhelm Ukraine's air defense.

Russia's mass missile and drone attack on Kyiv killed nine people and injured at least 70, including six children, overnight, according to Ukrainian officials. Fires have been reported in residential buildings, some of which were damaged due to the attack. 

Russia struck the city of Kharkiv with drones and missiles 24 times overnight, injuring one person, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said.  The attacks damaged multi-story residential buildings, a clinic, a school, a hotel, and industrial enterprises.

morsf73,1k6jb4s,reddit,"I think it's disingenuous to describe the ongoing thing as ""peace negotiations"".


Peace negotiations would be between the parties of the war. That's not what's happening. Neither Russia nor Ukraine believes any such deal to be realistic.


What's happening now is negotiations with the US on whether or not they should join in on damaging Ukraine. Russia is in favor, Europe (including Ukraine) is against.


This is what the US is threatening: They will support Russia unless they are given what they want. Some things they want: 1) a piece of Ukraine for themselves (e.g. all future oil, gas and mineral economic output, the ""minerals deal""), and 2) to construct a situation where Trump can look powerful and competent to a low-information US audience.


Increasingly the US is in a situation where they don't ""have the cards"". There's not much aid left that they can stop, and I have some doubts on how much direct support for Russia is politically viable for Trump.


Either way, the US is asking for things it cannot get, so the European strategy should be to keep the bullshit going with the US for as long as possible, just to avoid whatever idiocy happens when the process is over.

Russian forces attacked a commercial equipment manufacturing company in Kharkiv on the night of 23-24 April, causing no casualties.

Six Shahed loitering munitions struck the plant, two of which failed to detonate. According to Humennyi, some of the Shaheds were equipped with thermobaric warheads, a type of weapon that creates large fires at the site of the explosion.

Firefighters faced difficulties in extinguishing the fire immediately as the Shaheds came in rapid succession.

No company employees were injured in the attack. However, the explosions caused partial destruction of warehouses, a training centre, classrooms, a service centre, a mechanical shop, a metal painting shop and a polyvinyl chloride warehouse.

Czechia is now completely independent of Russian oil, Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala and other officials announced on April 17, marking the first time in history no Russian pipeline oil flows to the country.

Prague is receiving no supplies through Russia's Druzhba oil pipeline for the first time in over 60 years, securing alternative supplies thanks to the expansion of the western Transalpine Pipeline (TAL), running through Italy, Austria, and Germany. The move underscores Europe's efforts to end its reliance on Russian fossil fuels in response to Moscow's all-out invasion of Ukraine. In May, the EU is expected to present a plan for a full phase-out of Russian fossil fuels by 2027.

""We completed another step toward our energy independence,"" Fiala told journalists at the central oil storage facility near Prague alongside Finance Minister Zbynek Stanjura and Jaroslav Pantucek, director of the state-run oil transit company MERO.

Officials said Czechia has not been receiving Druzhba oil for several weeks. In recent years, Russian oil covered roughly half of the country's demand.

Prague expects up to 8 million metric tons of oil from the western pipeline per year, which should be sufficient to cover its needs. While the EU banned Russian pipeline oil imports in 2022, Czechia, Slovakia, and Hungary received a waiver from the ban due to the lack of viable alternatives.

Already in November 2022, the Czech government decided to launch the TAL-PLUS project to secure an alternative oil supply. Technical work on the project began in May 2024, and the same year, Prague said it would not seek an exemption from the ban on Russian oil.

The Druzhba pipeline, running from Russia through Ukraine and Belarus to EU countries, was first launched in then-Czechoslovakia in 1962.",2025-04-17 12:42:53,40,Well-Sourced,worldnews

The Third Assault Brigade liberated the village of Nadiia in Luhansk Oblast, aided by MLRS strikes on April 17.

Ukrainian forces have retaken the village of Nadiia in Luhansk Oblast after a 30-hour operation, the Third Assault Brigade announced. “We are heavily bombarding the occupiers’ positions with multiple launch missile systems and tank fire,” the brigade said. “Behind them, M113 armored vehicles are moving in with our infantry to storm Nadiia, which remained under enemy control.”

After dismounting, troops opened fire with small arms to push through and reclaim the village.

Volodymyr Fokin, commander of the 1st Assault Battalion of the brigade, said the recapture of Nadiia allows Ukrainian forces to maintain fire control over the Chorny Zherebets River and nearby settlements, including Raihorodka and Dzherelne.

“The capture of Nadiia complicates any mechanized enemy advance toward the village of Kopanky and further to Zelenyi Hai and Borova,” Fokin told Ukrainska Pravda.

He added that the maneuver also allows Ukrainian forces to target Pervomaysk (Stepy) and Vyshneve, solidifying a stronger defensive line and higher ground.

Andriy Biletsky, commander of Ukraine’s Third Army Corps, said Russia lost two mechanized regiments — the 752nd and 254th of the 20th Army — during the failed defense of the village. He said the units were ""wiped out.""",2025-04-17 13:24:29,36,Well-Sourced,worldnews

State Border Guard Service of Ukraine (SBGS) reported the delivery of special garments designed to protect the servicemen from detection by night vision cameras. Thermal insulation properties make the troops wearing them indistinguishable from their surroundings in the infrared spectrum.

According to the SBGS, the cloaks were crafted specifically for frontline combat operations. They don't hinder mobility, allowing soldiers to run, crawl, and maneuver freely during the missions.

""The protective kit includes the cloak itself, detachable 3D modular camouflage, heat-reflective gloves, and a storage bag. The system offers low thermal conductivity, infrared suppression, flexibility, and resistance to pressure, moisture, temperature fluctuations, and mechanical damage. It is also hypoallergenic and suitable for use in both extreme heat and cold,"" the border guard press service said in a statement.

The kits, valued at nearly half a million UAH, were donated to Ukrainian defenders by the staff of the Khmelnytskyi Nuclear Power Plant.

""Once the required inventory procedures are completed, the equipment will be transferred to a combat unit currently deployed on the eastern front.

Overnight on 17 April, Ukrainian drones struck the base of Russia’s 112th Missile Brigade in the city of Shuya, Ivanovo Oblast, Russia, for the second consecutive day, following the brigade’s involvement in a deadly missile strike on the Ukrainian city of Sumy. Shuya is located more than 700 km from Ukraine.

The attack came in response to a Russian ballistic missile strike on Sumy on 13 April that killed 36 people, including ten children, and wounded 129 others. The Ukrainian Defense Intelligence (HUR) identified the 112th and 448th brigades as responsible for launching two Iskander-M/KN-23 missiles at the city center. The missile units involved reportedly operated from locations in Kursk and Voronezh Oblasts.

On 17 April after 3 a.m., Russian social media users reported powerful explosions and what they described as a drone “raid,” according to Militarnyi.


Local residents said they heard at least three loud blasts and small arms fire. Eyewitness footage captured visible fire and attempts by Russian troops to shoot down drones.


Based on footage from a local resident, the Ukrainian Telegram channel Exilenova+ assessed that the drone strike damaged a hangar likely used to store Iskander missiles or other military equipment.

Prior to the explosions, local authorities had issued warnings of an imminent drone threat.

Russia’s Defense Ministry did not mention any drone shoot-downs in the regions in its morning reports,

On the morning of 16 April, Ukraine had already conducted a drone strike against the same military facility, targeting at least three buildings at military unit No. 03333, including its headquarters, barracks, and training center. Visual evidence from the scene supports reports of damage from the Liutyi drone strikes and fire on the site.


On 15 April, Ukrainian forces also struck the permanent base of the 448th missile brigade in Kursk Oblast, which, alongside the 112th, was identified as having launched the 13 April strike on Sumy.",2025-04-17 12:40:42,22,Well-Sourced,worldnews

> Kremlin may deny its involvement in war crimes, but the destruction of hospitals, schools, markets, and homes by Russians is well documented - and not in just one country.

This is a Russian clothing store that took over when the Japanese company Uniqlo left. According to the company in 2024 net revenue fell by 6% and profitability fell by 92%. Russia's previous largest clothing manufacturer, Gloria Jeans, has also closed. In response to a slowing economy and rising prices it seems like Russians are cutting back purchases on clothes and many of the clothes that were being offered after the foreign companies left were of poor quality anyway.

I find this interesting for a couple reasons. Firstly Russia tried to just ""take over"" all the foreign companies that pulled out but that doesn't seem to be working. Additionally lack of spending on clothes is a major sign of a slowdown and economic problems.

Goldman Sachs is predicting oil pricing could fall fairly significantly if there is a global slowdown from the effects of the Trump tariffs which is likely.

$70 per barrel was the average Urals price Russia has based its entire 2025 budget on, which was already at a large deficit (and increasing) due to soaring government spending on the war. That's if you actually believe their numbers in the first place which knowing them I would not.

Their economy is still massively dependent on oil and anything below this at the $40 - $55 per barrel predicted could be a disaster for them.

It's ironic that Trump might actually hurt Russia more than they ever would have thought, purely by his incompetence on tariffs potentially causing a global recession and crashing oil prices.

Unless Trump ends the trade wars / sanctions on Russia or gets involved in some sort of conflict in Iran (spiking oil prices), Russia certainly could have some major economic issues in the near future if the war continues.",2025-04-08 09:29:01,63,TheLowBro,worldnews

Ukrainian Defense Forces have eliminated a 24-year-old Russian soldier, Ruslan Omaralinov, a member of the 234th Pskov Airborne Assault Regiment, who was involved in war crimes in Bucha, says Colonel Anatolii Stefan of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

The soldiers of the 234th Pskov Airborne Assault Regiment, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Artem Horodilov, are implicated in the mass killings on Yablonska Street, where most of the bodies were found in Bucha.

Journalists from The New York Times have identified 22 soldiers who were present during the killings. Their investigation, which spanned eight months, revealed that the killings were part of a deliberate and systematic effort to secure a route to Kyiv.

Artist, volunteer, and military servicewoman Marharyta Polovinko died on 5 April while fighting against Russian forces in Ukraine, according to an announcement from the Second Mechanized Battalion of the 3rd Separate Assault Brigade.

“You were never afraid of responsibility, always kept your word and did more than was required of you. You died while performing a combat mission. With dignity. With weapons in your hands,” the battalion wrote in their announcement.

Polovinko will be buried in her hometown of Kryvyi Rih on 11 April, at the Alley of Glory in the central cemetery.

According to Suspilne Culture, Polovinko worked as a volunteer in 2024, evacuating wounded Ukrainian defenders on evacuation transport at the first link of the evacuation chain. She later joined the Second Mechanized Battalion of the 3rd Separate Assault Brigade.

Born on 24 March 1994, in Kryvyi Rih, Polovinko first studied at the Dnipropetrovsk Theater and Art College in the Faculty of Fine Arts. She later graduated from the National Academy of Fine Arts and Architecture, specializing in easel painting.

In an interview with Suspilne, Polovinko shared that she began painting extensively at the beginning of the full-scale invasion when the first news about children’s deaths in Irpin appeared. “I drew a girl who, like an angel, flies over houses. The girl flies over this ugliness of the world. My first perception of Russians was that they were monsters who came and fought against people,” Polovinko told Suspilne",2025-04-08 23:01:51,25,Well-Sourced,worldnews

Kropyvnytskyi held a farewell ceremony for 21-year-old soldier Ilya Medvedev, call sign Kasl, who was killed fighting in Ukraine’s Donetsk Oblast and had been missing since March 13, 2024, according to the city council on April 8.

Kropyvnytskyi honored fallen soldier Ilya Medvedev on April 8 with a funeral procession and a national moment of silence in Heroes’ Square, the city council said. He was laid to rest at the Alley of Honorary Military Burials at the Far Eastern Cemetery.

Medvedev, 21, was born Jan. 8, 2003, in the village of Panchevo in Ukraine’s Kirovohrad Oblast. He grew up in Novomyrhorod, where he loved sports and reading, especially the works of Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko. He once told family he wanted to become strong “so I can protect my mother and anyone who needs my help.”

A top student, Medvedev graduated from high school with a gold medal in 2020 and went on to study English and German translation at Volodymyr Vynnychenko Central Ukrainian State University.

After Russia launched its full-scale invasion, Medvedev joined Ukraine’s 121st Separate Territorial Defense Brigade at age 19. He later transferred to the 3rd Separate Assault Brigade, fighting as a machine gunner in key battles near Bakhmut, Avdiivka, Krasnohorivka and Orlivka.

Medvedev went missing March 13, 2024, during a combat mission near Orlivka in Donetsk Oblast, after coming under heavy Russian artillery fire, local officials said. His death was later confirmed through DNA testing.

He is survived by his mother, sister and grandmother.",2025-04-08 22:51:00,21,Well-Sourced,worldnews

On April 6, a number of Western embassies in Ukraine lowered their flags in memory of the victims. That night another multiple Russian missile strike was launched against the Ukrainian capital which killed one man and injured three others.

> Israel’s decision before the ceasefire collapsed to block humanitarian aid from entering the enclave, in what it described as a move to pressure Hamas into accepting new terms for an extension of the ceasefire rather than proceed with phase two of the truce.

> The attacks came less than a week after Israel renewed its assault across the strip on March 18, breaking a weeks-long ceasefire with Hamas. 

> The Israeli military told CNN earlier its forces had opened fire that day at “suspicious vehicles,” including ambulances and fire trucks, that were advancing toward troops without prior coordination, use of headlights or emergency signals.

> It said it had “eliminated” a number of Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants by firing on the vehicles and condemned what it claimed was “the repeated use of civilian infrastructure by the terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip, including the use of medical facilities and ambulances for terrorist purposes.”

> UNOCHA and aid groups accuse Israel of violating international law by blocking the flow of aid into Gaza and of using starvation as a weapon of war. The same organizations have accused Israel of restricting or creating hurdles to the entry of aid throughout the war.

> Eight of the 14 bodies recovered Sunday from the site in the southern Rafah area were identified as members of the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS), five as civil defense, and one as a UN agency employee, PRCS said in a statement. One PRCS medic remains missing.

> The body of a fifteenth person, a civil defense worker, was recovered last Thursday from the site, after PRCS said they were initially denied access to the area. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military.

> OCHA, the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said the bodies were recovered after a “complex, week-long rescue operation” that involved using bulldozers and heavy machinery to unearth the victims and their battered vehicles from under sand.

mnz6ph6,1k2npij,reddit,"One of the warmer takes I've had is that total victory remains on the table for each side and in both cases I think it could mirror WWI style collapses.

For Russian ""total victory"" I could possibly see a version of the sucessful western front ""bite and hold"" tactics where Russia uses superior infantry numbers to take small ground, reinforce and then slowly push Ukraine back. If Europe is unable to manufacture enough weapons while Russia maintains a constant stream of volunteers then I think they could eventually break the Ukrainian lines and once those lines are broken we could see rapid advancements. This is a possibility if Ukraine doesn't get the resources they need and it's important to remember once collapses happen they can spiral out of control fast. If it takes Russia 1 million casualties to take 20% of Ukraine that doesn't mean they would need 2 million casualties to take 40%.

For Ukrainian total victory I think if we see big infantry pushes by Russia followed by extremely heavy casualties and little ground gained for 2025 then that could be very bad long term for them. Russia's financial picture isn't looking great and if we start to see mass bankruptcies, banks collapsing and wages to soldiers not getting paid then we could see their morale crumble and loyalties dissolve overnight. Soldiers who fight for money expect to be paid. In WWI Russia was launching offensives right up to the moment their entire front line collapsed. They regularly treated their soldiers' lives as disposable, corruption was rampant and they ignored deep economic problems at home while having a delusional authoritarian leader. Societal and military collapses often go hand in hand and things that were impossible in summer 2023 might suddenly be very possible in a different environment. The fighting in Aleppo was hell from 2012-2016 and then in 2024 the battle was won in a matter of days.

The excerpt read: ""Oh bury me, then rise ye up / And break your heavy chains / And water with the tyrants’ blood / The freedom you have gained.""

A second case was filed against her in August after she gave an interview to Radio Free Europe in which she called Russia’s war in Ukraine ""monstrous"" and ""criminal.""

At one of her hearings, Kozyreva defended her actions by saying she had ""merely recited a poem, and pasted a quote in Ukrainian, nothing more,"" the St. Petersburg courts' press service said. Prosecutors reportedly sought a six-year sentence.

""The national flag still flies over Kyiv, and it always will,"" Kozureva said in her final statement in court, according to Russian independent outlet Mediazona. ""I still dream that Ukraine will reclaim every inch of its territory: Donbas, Crimea, all of it. And I believe that one day, it will. History will judge, and judge fairly. But Ukraine has already won. It has won. That’s all.""

Kozyreva has been targeted by authorities before.

OVD-Info said she was detained in December 2022 while still in high school for writing, ""Murderers, you bombed it. Judases,"" on a city installation honoring the twinning of St. Petersburg and occupied Mariupol.

She was later fined for ""discrediting"" the army and expelled from university for a post about the ""imperialist nature of the war,"" according to the human rights group Memorial, which has recognized her as a political prisoner.

""Daria Kozyreva is being punished for quoting a classic of 19th-century Ukrainian poetry, for speaking out against an unjust war and for refusing to stay silent,"" Amnesty International’s Russia Director Natalia Zviagina said in a statement. ""We demand the immediate and unconditional release of Daria Kozyreva and everyone imprisoned under 'war censorship laws.'""

OVD-Info reports that more than 1,500 people are currently jailed in Russia on political grounds, and over 20,000 have been detained for anti-war views since February 2022.",2025-04-19 22:39:23,33,Well-Sourced,worldnews

Soldiers from the 14th National Guard Chervona Kalyna Brigade have performed an emergency blood transfusion for a wounded brother-in-arms who could not be evacuated due to constant Russian attacks. Reserve blood was delivered by drone.

During intense fighting with Russian forces on the Pokrovsk front, one of the Ukrainian servicemen sustained a serious injury and was rapidly losing blood. Evacuation was impossible due to heavy Russian fire.

An emergency blood transfusion was the only chance to save the soldier’s life. However, in field conditions without a surgeon, plasma or standard medical equipment, the procedure seemed almost impossible.

""A swift solution was found: reserve blood was delivered… by drone. From the rear, where a mobile medical unit was located, medics prepared a container filled with blood, secured it tightly, and sent it by drone straight to the line of fire.

The blood was successfully dropped directly into the place where the wounded soldier’s brothers-in-arms were staying. Everything that followed was teamwork and faith,"" the Chervona Kalyna Brigade reported.

Reconnaissance unit soldiers carried out the transfusion under the guidance of a surgeon via video call. The procedure was successful.

""The soldier’s condition was stabilised, and he was later evacuated to hospital. His condition is now stable. And this whole story is another reminder: in this war, victory comes not only through weapons and drones but also through resolve, ingenuity and brotherhood,"" the Brigade emphasised.",2025-04-10 11:30:32,41,Well-Sourced,worldnews
mmc9vr4,1jvp3py,reddit,"One thing that occasionally goes through my mind. When the invasion began, Russia managed to take large swaths of land in southern Ukraine rather quickly, within a month or so. Most of the vehicles and troops came from Crimea via Armyansk, and a bit via the roads at Chonhar and Henichesk.

[Aside from those three roads and chokepoints](https://deepstatemap.live/en#10/46.0303525/34.3377686), the rest of Crimea is separated from the rest of Ukraine by the [Syvash ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syvash)(Rotten Sea). If it was known that Russia would invade someday in the future (for which Ukraine has been preparing its military all the way since 2014), why didn't they also attempt to dig out a moat at Armyansk and block off the other two roads/bridges? There was merely a border crossing at Armyansk through which Russian vehicles casually crossed on Feb 24 2022 and continued inward. If there was no land connection between Ukraine and Crimea, Russia would have had a much harder time capturing Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, only being able to muster a significant force from the east, while it would take them time to build a proper bridgehead to cross from Crimea.

Has there been any analysis done on this matter?",2025-04-10 05:07:20,35,Glavurdan,worldnews

In the 38 months since Russia widened its war on Ukraine, Japan has pledged around $10 billion in aid to the war-ravaged country. But this aid is strictly “nonlethal,” according to Japanese international relations expert Higashino Atsuko.

That might surprise the Ukrainian brigades riding in Japanese engineering vehicles. A Japanese-made Morooka PC-065B—a five-ton, tracked vehicle with a cargo bed and a three-ton crane—made its first appearance along the front line in Ukraine in a recent video.

Back in May 2023, the Japanese government pledged to Kyiv a batch of 101 vehicles, including Toyota trucks and some of the PC-065Bs. The vehicles began arriving in Ukraine via Poland a few weeks later.

The PC-065Bs are unarmored and unarmed, but they perform an important front-line role that puts them and their crews in harm’s way—and indirectly inflicts equal harm on Russian forces.

With their excellent mobility across mud, capacious cargo beds and cranes, the PC-065Bs can help engineers build the bunkers and other fortifications that help outnumbered Ukrainian infantry survive artillery and drone bombardment and repel powerful Russian assaults.

The PC-065Bs joined hundreds of similar logistics vehicles in Ukrainian service—some optimized for construction, others better suited for cargo-hauling missions or ambulance duty. These ex-Australian M-113AS4 Armored Logistics Vehicles, Swedish-made BV-206s and BVS-10s and ex-Norwegian NM199s share certain key characteristics.

They’re tracked and lightweight for their size, which translates into excellent drivability in the glue-like mud that dominates rural Ukraine in the spring. The same mobility is useful year-round in the swamps of southern Ukraine.

It’s not for no reason that the BVS-10s have been spotted in the ambulance role with the new 40th Coastal Defense Brigade, a Ukrainian marine corps unit that defends the right bank of the Dnipro River in southern Ukraine’s Kherson Oblast.

The downside of these vehicles’ lightness is that they’re extremely vulnerable to Russian drones, artillery—really, any kind of firepower. In three years of hard fighting, the Ukrainians have lost around 15 of their tracked support vehicles. The losses don’t yet include any of the Japanese-made PC-065Bs.",2025-04-10 11:46:50,32,Well-Sourced,worldnews

The Ukrainian Navy has deployed river assault boats on the Dnipro River as a mobile air defense unit, providing an additional layer of protection against russian Shahed drones targeting the capital.

As reported by Army TV, the boats, such as the Riverine assault boat, operating near Kyiv, are equipped with Browning heavy machine guns and MK-19 grenade launchers, enabling them to engage aerial threats. The vessels feature five firing positions that can be configured with either machine guns or grenade launchers depending on mission requirements.

“The boat is fast, highly maneuverable, and can be quickly positioned for accurate targeting,” one serviceman said. He noted that while firing from a moving platform presents challenges, crews are trained to stabilize the boat to enable effective engagement. The boats are lightly armored to withstand small-arms fire up to 7.62 mm caliber. Their mobility allows them to respond rapidly to drone incursions, which have become a regular threat in the region.

The crews include both experienced military personnel and former civilian sailors who transitioned to military service. One boat commander, a former tugboat operator, joined the flotilla in 2023 after completing military training at a university.

Russian forces continue to adapt their drone tactics, changing flight paths to avoid Ukrainian defenses. “They used to fly through the Kyiv Reservoir, but changed routes after we began intercepting them,” a serviceman reported.

The crews recall participating in the response to one of the largest drone attacks over Kyiv, during which approximately 140 Shahed drones were launched.

mmf7c0q,1jvp3py,reddit,"[I didn't see anyone post the most recent Anders Puck Nielsen video yesterday on Russia's spring offensive so here it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmU-Eazta1s)

Video summary: Puck Nielsen argues that Russia has had some notable successes at the strategic level by convincing the White House that they're on track to win but the problem for Russia is that their battlefield results haven't had this same success and they're not taking significant ground. For Russia's narrative (both domestically and internationally) to work they NEED to be taking ground and have to stay on the offensive however the Russian army of 2025 is far less armored and capable of major breakthroughs than they were in 2023 or 2024 due to attrition and losses so it looks like Russia is going to launch a major offensive relying primarily on dismounted infantry.

My commentary: I think this is an interesting take and reminds me of WWI in which Russia kept launching offensives even up until the moment that their military collapsed entirely. As of 2025 dismounted infantry waves without armor in a drone rich environment is a recipe for mass casualties. I do think Russia can take some ground and (jokes about donkeys aside) they should be taken very seriously but I think they do run the risk of having losses that exceed their ability to recruit replacements. In order to pay the high bonuses of their recruits they also need oil to remain relatively high. A period of extra high losses combined with low oil prices could be seriously bad news for Russia.",2025-04-10 17:29:19,47,socialistrob,worldnews

Ukrainian military intelligence and soldiers from the 128th Mountain Assault Brigade have forced the Russian troops out of the village of Shcherbaky in southern Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia direction, Militarnyi reports.

A video released by the Main Intelligence Directorate (HUR) press service on 9 April 2025 shows combat operations conducted by Group 10 of the HUR’s Department of Active Operations “in the Zaporizhzhia front.” The footage features precision work by FPV drone pilots and the clearing of the settlement from Russian soldiers.

HUR’s report does not explicitly mention Shcherbaky. Also, the exact date of reclaiming the village was not specified.

According to emblems visible in the HUR’s video, soldiers from Ukraine’s 128th Mountain Assault Brigade worked jointly with intelligence operatives in this section of the front, Militarnyi says.

The released footage shows Russian troops trying to take cover in detached houses and defend their positions. However, the coordinated efforts of Ukrainian drone operators and infantry thwarted their attempts.

In the operation, Russian forces suffered more than 12 fatalities, HUR said. Two more Russian assault troops were taken prisoner during the village clearing operation. Russian occupiers’ documents were also captured and shown in the footage.

Czech military sources, cited by the Czech daily Hospodářské noviny (HN), said that Prague transferred the last of its T-72M1/M4 tanks to Ukraine in March and early April. This was part of Czechia’s multi-year drive to replace much of its Soviet-era hardware with more modern Western equipment.

In doing so it was able to support Ukraine’s armed forces in the war that was instigated by Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion.

A source from Czechia’s 7th Armored Brigade said its 73rd Battalion had been equipped with upgraded T-72M4CZ tanks that relatively quickly began to wear out and were replaced in 2020 by unmodified T72M1’s straight out of “mothballs.”

The source said: “When they pulled them out, we were quite amazed. They were older, but everything worked on them.” He then added, in apparent confirmation of the Ukrainian deliveries, “I can now say that there is not a single T-72M1 left at the base.”  

No one is quite sure about the final disposition of the 30 unserviceable T-72M4CZ tanks that were replaced five years ago.

Following a meeting with the then US President Joe Biden and NATO’s “Bucharest Nine” in Warsaw on the first anniversary of the Russian invasion, Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala pledged to provide all of its tanks as well as more than 220 armored vehicles and almost 40 howitzers.

Having denuded its stocks of T-72 tanks, Czechia’s 73rd Battalion has currently only received around 15 “second-hand” Leopards 2A4s, with more promised over the next 18 months. Its troops complain that some of these are in poor condition and require maintenance and upgrades to bring them up to operational standard.

These 2A4s are also a “stop-gap” as Prague is in the process of carrying out a long-term acquisition of 77 more modern Leopard 2A8s. A similar modernization process is underway to replace the other armored vehicles Prague has donated to Ukraine.",2025-04-09 12:53:30,36,Well-Sourced,worldnews

A Russian military court will rule Wednesday on whether or not to grant the Defense Ministry’s request to release a general arrested on fraud allegations and send him to the frontline in Ukraine, state-run media reported, citing the general’s lawyer.

Major General Ivan Popov, who commanded Russia’s 58th Combined Arms Army in Ukraine, was arrested in May 2024 on accusations of misappropriating $1.5 million worth of metal intended for reinforcing defensive structures in occupied Ukraine. Popov was initially granted house arrest, but was returned to pre-trial detention over unspecified violations.

“Together with the Defense Ministry, we have filed a motion to suspend proceedings and change the form of restraint due to the decision to send Ivan Ivanovich [Popov] to the special military operation [in Ukraine],” lawyer Sergei Buinovsky told the state-run news agency TASS.

The Tambov Garrison Military Court, south of Moscow, took a 30-minute break ahead of the prosecution’s sentencing request, TASS reported.

President Vladimir Putin signed laws in October allowing courts to suspend or terminate criminal cases and send defendants who sign military contracts to fight in Ukraine. A soldier’s criminal record can be expunged if they are presented with state awards for their conduct on the battlefield.

Last month, Russian media reported that Popov had asked Putin to allow him to “continue smashing the enemy” in Ukraine in a letter that the Kremlin said it received.",2025-04-09 14:20:51,18,Logical_Welder3467,worldnews

The Patriot batteries Ukraine does have are protecting Kyiv, Lviv, Odesa and key infrastructure in the interior.  If Ukraine were to move the Patriot systems closer to the front lines not only would they potentially be more vulnerable to Russian attacks but this would expose Ukraine's growing military industrial base to attacks.

Hence Ukraine desiring to purchase more new systems and missiles.

SAMPT is supposed to have some ballistic missile intercept ability.  It is hard to understand why it is not being pumped out by its manufacturer in France & Italy.  They missed a golden opportunity.

Ukraine has advised they are working on their own anti-ballistic missile systems, and I feel Ukraine has a proven record of bringing technology up to functional very quickly.

A tour guide will earn a Western wage and we are talking about a poor nation so each dollar lasts. Meaning becoming a tour guide is very profitable. And it can be safe. The dangerous job is laying ladders over crevasses at the bottom. They move all the time and many Sherpas die here and Westeners don't do this insane job. Many who die climbing up top make stupid errors. But it's expected. A smart Sherpa can stay alive on top compared to inexperienced and arrogant Western tourists.

If he doesn't lay down ladders he can easily continue on like this. If he's smart about it and doesn't push to the top in a storm or at night he could even grow old and retire. Of course you can't predict avalanches. And some storms take you by surprise. But today we have proper internet weather prediction. This was probably what killed most climbers before the late 1990's. Now often people know a storm is coming and still risk it. A Sherpa won't be this stupid.

mnr2yw4,1k1w02v,reddit,"[Rheinmetall: Shell Output at New Lower Saxony Factory Will Almost Double Corporate Plan | Kyiv Post](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/51029)

Artillery shell output at a state-of-the-art Rheinmetall factory will be almost twice initial corporate targets and, thanks to near-bottomless demand for munitions driven by the Russo-Ukraine War, production and profits for Germany’s biggest arms manufacturer will  accelerate, CEO Armin Papperger said in Thursday comments to industry media.

A brand-new Rheinmetall artillery shell production facility in the Lower-Saxony village   Unterlüß, coming on line in 2026, will be able to produce up to 350,000 155mm shells per year instead of the planned 200,000, Papperger told the major German business publication Handelsblatt in an interview.

Rheinmetall broke ground on the $341 million (€300) Unterlüß facility in February 2024.  Besides artillery ammunition – especially the war-critical 155mm howitzer shell – the factory will employ 500 workers producing 1,900 tonnes of RDX explosive and, optionally, other components for producing ammunition charges. In addition, production of rocket engines and possibly warheads could take place here, a corporate statement said.

Unterlüß will become Europe’s second-largest artillery plant after a Rheinmetall-owned factory in Spain, where 450,000 shells a year will be produced annually, Papperberger said.

After first-person-view (FPV) drones, the most effective weapon used by both sides of the Russo-Ukraine War is artillery. Thanks to on-off US arms deliveries and slow European government orders to companies like Rheinmetall, Ukraine’s army, in more than three years of conventional combat against Russia, has faced multiple crippling shell shortages, most severely in the latter half of 2022 and in the first five months of 2024.

Russian shell output is greater than Europe’s and since January 2024, Russia’s ally, North Korea, has sent Moscow an additional four million artillery shells, enabling Russian army  artillery to heavily outgun the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) throughout most of the war.

The Ukrainian military research group Defense Express on Thursday reported that Rheinmetall’s world-wide annual production capacity of 750,000 artillery shells is the single most important agency, by any state or corporation, in helping the AFU redress that Russian advantage.

A Rheinmetall production graphic published by Handelsblatt put the total number of artillery shells manufactured by the company in 2022 at 70,000 rounds, and the projected number in 2027 at 1.1 million rounds. Some military media have reported the figure might rise to 1.5-1.7 shells if in-place plans to accelerate production succeed.

The Ukrainian plant will deliver “significantly more” than the originally planned 150,000 155mm shells per year and production will start in 2026, Papperberger said.",2025-04-18 12:58:51,61,Well-Sourced,worldnews

Russian attacks across Ukrainian regions killed at least 11 civilians and injured at least 119, including children, over the past day, regional authorities said on April 18.

Recent weeks saw Russia intensify its strikes against Ukraine's civilian infrastructure and residential areas as Moscow continues to reject a full ceasefire backed by Washington and Kyiv.

Moscow's forces launched an Iskander-M ballistic missile, five Iskander-K cruise missiles, and 37 attack and decoy drones against Ukraine overnight, the Air Force reported.

Ukrainian air defenses shot down 23 drones and three cruise missiles, and 10 decoy drones disappeared from radars, according to the statement.

Russia launched a missile attack against the city of Kharkiv on the morning of April 18, killing at least one person and injuring at least 87, including children, authorities said.

The attack damaged at least 20 apartment buildings, 30 houses, and an educational institution. A fire broke out on the premises of an enterprise, covering an area of 450 square meters.

Two civilians were injured in Russian attacks elsewhere in Kharkiv Oblast, Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported.

In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, two people were killed and five injured during a heavy artillery strike against the city of Nikopol on April 17, Governor Serhii Lysak said.

mnu59oy,1k1w02v,reddit,"[Anders Puck Nielsen's latest video on the revolution of drones and what it means for war in general](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZL1KzV54Cw)

My summary: Nielsen argues that right now Ukraine is the world leader in drones and Russia isn't far behind. Drones have revolutionized warfare and have given defenders a significant advantage. In the past ""modern warfare"" meant fast manuevre (ie Blitzkrieg or Desert Storm) but we're now entering an era where ""modern warfare"" may be defined by static and positional fighting. Nielsen argues that NATO nations are at a risk of being overconfident against Russia given that Russia has a much better understanding of drone warfare than NATO nations who haven't adopted this doctrine. Going into a hypothetical war with the assumptions of maneuver doctrine when the new reality is defensive doctrine has the advantage could be disastrous. It's now going to be easier for NATO nations to defend territory than in the past but retaking territory may be significantly harder. 

My take: I think this video is going to piss people off especially the ones who act think of the Russian military as bumbling idiots. The idea that Ukraine has a high degree of tactical understanding of war than many western leaders will ruffle feathers but I hope people don't disregard the message. We should be careful not to overlearn the lessons of the war in Ukraine and assume every war will be a repeat of it but at the same time the future of war is drones and drones can enable a smaller country to cast a much bigger shadow. Drones can give Ukraine a real shot at victory against Russia but if western countries aren't careful they could also be used as a force multiplier by Russia or China. I'm confident in European NATO's ability to defeat Russia in a conventional war but I agree with Nielsen that they should be studying drone warfare very quickly.",2025-04-18 22:39:06,43,socialistrob,worldnews

Germany will provide Ukraine with additional military equipment to support its defense against Russian attacks, Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said in Berlin on 27 March.

The aid package reportedly includes air defense systems, drones, and radar equipment, signaling continued German support for Ukraine’s military efforts, according to Ukrinform.

“We know that real peace does not come through capitulation,” Baerbock said at a joint press conference in Berlin with his Estonian colleague Margus Tsakhkna. “Those who pressure Ukraine to surrender are not negotiating peace but paving the way for another escalation.”

This German support as others from another European countries comes amid the US President’s efforts to negotiate with Russia over the war in Ukraine. Putin reportedly agreed to a 30-day ceasefire proposal, particularly a freeze on attacks on energy infrastructure, but brutal attacks on Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure continue. Despite the ongoing negotiations in different formats, the US President Donald Trump softened stance on Russia in this process, saying that the US is considering lifting some sanctions on Russia as part of efforts to secure a ceasefire agreement in the Black Sea.

Europe has been ramping up its military support for Ukraine and maintaining a firm stance on sanctions against Russia.

Bundestag’s budget committee’s decided also to allocate an additional €3 billion in military aid to Ukraine for 2025. Baerbock highlighted that European sanctions against Russia will remain in place until peace is achieved.

Estonian Foreign Minister Tsahkna supported Germany’s stance, noting that Ukraine has been fully prepared for a ceasefire. “Ukraine has done everything and 100% agrees to a cessation of hostilities,” Tsahkna said. He stressed the importance of ensuring no negotiations occur about Ukraine without Ukraine’s participation.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also said that lifting sanctions before peace would be a significant mistake. The announcement comes as Baerbock prepares to step down from her ministerial role, with a potential future position as President of the UN General Assembly.

Baerbock welcomed the European Commission’s proposal for a European defense industry, suggesting that creating a European Defense Union is “a matter of time.” She called for reforming EU decision-making processes to enable faster and more coordinated actions.",2025-03-28 11:21:33,39,Well-Sourced,worldnews

Former Iran International TV journalist Kourosh Sehati has become the first known Iranian to join Ukraine’s Foreign Legion, trading his broadcasting career for frontline combat against Russian forces, RFE/RL reports. A rights activist who was arrested multiple times for his political activities in Iran, Sehati fled Iran to Türkiye in 2004. He was granted political refugee status before moving to the United States.

The 46-year-old, who previously worked for Voice of America’s Persian Service and holds US citizenship, announced his decision to enlist on 18 March, stating on X that he had joined to “fight the criminal Putin and his backers.“

In an interview with RFE/RL’s Radio Farda, Sehati explained he was defending Ukraine against what he called “the club of dictators and invaders,” referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin and his key allies, including Iran’s clerical rulers, Belarusian leader Aleksandr Lukashenko, North Korea, and China.

His decision was also deeply personal. “I have an attachment to Ukraine because my wife is Ukrainian and our kids are half Ukrainian,” Sehati told Radio Farda, adding that his family lives in London.

Sehati’s opposition to Moscow extends beyond the current war, rooted in what he describes as Iran’s historical grievances against Russia. “Russia has hurt Iran a lot over the last 200 years,” Sehati said in the interview.

Persia and tsarist Russia fought multiple wars in the 19th century, resulting in Tehran ceding much of the Caucasus to Moscow. The Russian Empire also competed for control of Iran’s natural resources and occupied Iranian territory.

These tensions continued into the mid-1940s when the Soviet Union supported short-lived ethnic Kurdish and Azeri republics in northwestern Iran. Although quickly dismantled, these republics contributed to ethnic tensions that remain today.

Sehati said one of his key motivations for enlisting was to change how Ukrainians view Iranians.",2025-03-28 17:33:15,39,Well-Sourced,worldnews

Russia has intensified assault operations in the Zaporizhzhia sector, increasing pressure on Ukraine's southern positions, Ukraine's Southern Defense Forces spokesperson Vladyslav Voloshyn said on March 28 during Ukraine's state-run telethon.

The Ukrainian military reported escalating hostilities and a rise in attacks on key areas. Zaporizhzhia Oblast holds strategic importance for Russia, underscoring its efforts to advance in the region.

Voloshyn said Russia seeks to strengthen its position ahead of potential truce or ceasefire negotiations. ""The Russians want to get as much of a head start or advance as much as possible in Zaporizhzhia Oblast,"" he said.

According to the spokesperson, Russian forces have massed troops for assault operations using small infantry groups. This tactic, deployed in other sectors, has yielded some results in Zaporizhzhia, particularly near Orikhiv and Hulyaypole. 

he number of such attacks has risen significantly since the beginning of spring, Voloshyn said.

Zaporizhzhia Oblast, in southeastern Ukraine, borders Dnipropetrovsk Oblast to the north, Donetsk Oblast to the east, and Kherson Oblast to the south. It is also home to the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, one of Europe's largest.

Russian forces partially control the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. Moscow claims to have annexed the entire territory of these regions in 2022, despite failing to control the regional capitals of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.

A Kremlin-linked official told the Moscow Times that Russian President Vladimir Putin cannot afford to lose these territories politically, making their retention a priority at any cost. While a ceasefire and peace deal could freeze the war along current front lines, Ukraine is unlikely to recognize Russian-occupied territories as legally part of Russia.",2025-03-28 11:25:26,31,Well-Sourced,worldnews

The European Union, Sweden, and Germany announced a financial package of 44 million euros ($47 mn) to support Ukrainian civil society organizations, with a significant focus on gender equality and women’s leadership development.

This latest funding builds on previous support, with over $162 million already provided since the full-scale invasion began.

“Women have become the driving force of Ukraine’s resilience, leading community efforts to restore and overcome the devastating consequences of this war,” said EU Ambassador to Ukraine Kateryna Maternova at the “Women for a Strong Ukraine” event.

The funding package includes: $14 million in new grant competitions, $6.4 million specifically dedicated to women’s leadership development, additional $18 million from Sweden and Germany, $14 million accelerated by the EU for democratic processes.

The support targets multiple critical areas, including: humanitarian assistance, justice support, internally displaced person aid, war crime documentation, combating disinformation.

Maternova said that the new financing will not only expand opportunities for women across all societal layers but also address challenges faced during the war.

Those interested in exploring funding opportunities can find detailed information on the EU Delegation’s portal.

This announcement follows the EU Council’s recent approval of $3.8 billion in financial assistance through the Ukraine Facility, which aims to support reforms in energy, border crossing procedures, and regulatory improvements.",2025-03-28 11:22:33,21,Well-Sourced,worldnews

Russia’s mass military recruitment efforts are becoming increasingly costly as the war in Ukraine drags on for a fourth year, with the state shelling out some 2 billion rubles ($22 million) per day on sign-on bonuses for new recruits alone.

The figures, based on official data from the Finance Ministry and regional budgets, were compiled by Janis Kluge, a senior associate at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP) in Berlin.

According to Kluge’s analysis, approximately three-quarters of the sign-on bonuses to military recruits — around 1.5 billion rubles ($18.3 million) per day — are shouldered by regional governments, many of which are now allocating nearly 3% of their annual budgets to the recruitment campaign. The remaining 500 million rubles ($6.1 million) come from the federal budget.

Despite a slowdown in increases of sign-on bonuses across the country, recruitment levels remain consistent with late 2024, with an estimated 1,000 to 1,500 new soldiers joining the Russian military each day.

The average one-time bonus offered to recruits across 37 Russian regions currently stands at about 1.4 million rubles (around $15,500).

Compared to the same period a year ago, the number of new contract soldiers has nearly doubled, according to Kluge — a surge that appears sufficient to replace estimated daily frontline losses, as NATO officials currently assess Russian casualties at roughly 1,000 troops per day.",2025-04-15 14:19:13,26,Logical_Welder3467,worldnews

""Ukraine, together with international partners, continues efforts to boost operator capacity and expand funding options for demining,"" he noted.

""In particular, the National Mine Action Authority supported the acceleration of introducing innovative technologies into demining. The Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Defense are working on regulatory frameworks to bring these innovations into operation.""

Moreover, the government passed a decision allowing funds raised through the UNITED24 platform to be used for paying for humanitarian demining services. This adds new tools for financing operations and opens opportunities for faster land clearance.

In March, new approaches to financing from international partners also emerged. For the first time, funds were allocated directly for demining — the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation (AICS) announced a grant competition to clear land in Ukraine’s frontline oblasts. Italian nonprofit organizations, selected through the competition, may also engage Ukrainian operators to implement these projects.

The state compensation program for demining agricultural land launched in September 2024. It provides 100% coverage for demining land that will be cleared through the program and 80% compensation for previously cleared land, provided the farmer can submit supporting documentation. Last year, over UAH 500 million ($13 mln) were spent under this initiative.

AICS launched a grant competition to clear landmines and war remnants in frontline regions of Ukraine in March 2025.

Ukraine also introduced an innovation platform for humanitarian demining and implemented a mechanism for leasing and renting demining equipment.",2025-04-15 18:27:21,23,Well-Sourced,worldnews

Ukrainian intelligence community InformNapalm exposed a sanctions evasion scheme involving Russian and Indian companies that supplied critical equipment to Russia’s military-industrial complex, according to an investigation published by the organization.

Russia has been evading Western sanctions by utilizing third countries, such as those in Central Asia and the Caucasus, to re-export prohibited goods, and by employing tactics like “parallel imports” and trading through intermediaries in regions like Türkiye and the UA.

Western countries imposed sanctions on Russia in response to its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, aiming to condemn the aggression and disrupt Russia’s economy.

The operation revealed that Russian company EMT, which was placed under US sanctions in October 2024, purchased restricted European equipment through Indian firm Park Controls & Communications (PCC).

Documents obtained by Ukrainian hacker group “256 Cyber Assault” showed that PCC deceived French manufacturer HGH Infrared Systems by claiming to be the end user of an IRCOL Collimator testing system, while actually redirecting the equipment to Russia.

The collimator, used for testing night vision devices and thermal imagers, was ordered by Russian company Zenit-Investprom, part of the Shvabe holding within Russian state corporation Rostec. The equipment was valued at 59 million Indian rupees (over $687 000), with payments processed through Sberbank India.

The Indian side reportedly was “fully aware” that the French supplier adheres to sanctions imposed on Russia. According to the investigation, PCC management deliberately committed fraud and declared itself the end user of the equipment.

When contacted by InformNapalm, HGH Infrared Systems confirmed it had taken action.

“We do not sell our products to Russia and require all third parties with whom we transact to adhere to this requirement,” said a spokesperson for the French company. “On learning that a customer may be in breach of the terms of sale, we have terminated our relationship with the business given they could not provide evidence to the contrary.”

According to intercepted communications, the operation effectively blocked the Russian procurement channel that EMT considered “very priority, convenient and reliable.”

When the temporary license key for the equipment expired, Russian technicians were unable to complete setup. PCC and EMT then discussed sending the equipment back to India to deceive HGH representatives by pretending it never left India.

In a March 2025 letter, EMT officials expressed concern about potential damage to their relationship with PCC, describing the Indian firm as a “reliable supplier” that was fulfilling “several promising contracts for the needs of Russian defense enterprises.”

The investigation documented the entire procurement chain, including shipping invoices showing the equipment transported from Bangalore to Moscow by Russian airline Volga-Dnepr.",2025-03-27 11:38:55,40,Well-Sourced,worldnews

North Korea transferred around 3,000 additional soldiers to Russia in January and February to compensate for battlefield losses sustained fighting Ukrainian forces, AP reported on March 27, citing South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff.

President Volodymyr Zelensky previously said that North Korean forces fighting for Russia had suffered around 4,000 casualties, with two-thirds killed.

Iran has completely pulled their forces out of Yemen, ending their support of the Houthis after Trump's threats to hold Iran responsible for continued Houthi attacks. Iran now sees a Houthi collapse as inevitable, as their supporting network of proxies has crumbled - without Hamas and Syria, and with Hezbollah much weaker, it's much more difficult for Iran to keep the Houthis propped up, especially with the US Navy conducting daily strikes for like a month now. And with the Houthis now exposed, the Yemeni government is taking the opportunity to open a massive ground offensive against them, with US air support.

moolcei,1k6b9zp,reddit,"""The foreign ministers of three key European allies of Israel issued a strongly worded joint statement Wednesday calling on Israel to end its “intolerable” aid blockade on Gaza while singling out Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz’s recent comments on aid as “unacceptable” and harmful to “prospects for peace.”

The statement, from the foreign ministers of Germany, France and the United Kingdom, called on Israel to lift its bar on aid from entering the war-decimated enclave since March 8, warning of “an acute risk of starvation, epidemic disease and death” for Palestinian civilians.“The Israeli decision to block aid from entering Gaza is intolerable,” it read. “

This must end. We urge Israel to immediately re-start a rapid and unimpeded flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza in order to meet the needs of all civilians.”

The United Nations warned this week that the blockade has pushed the humanitarian situation in the war-ravaged enclave to its worst point of the 16-month conflict.

The three European foreign ministers said that Katz has politicized humanitarian aid in recent comments that they deem to be “unacceptable” and which “harm prospects for peace.”

“Humanitarian aid must never be used as a political tool and Palestinian territory must not be reduced nor subjected to any demographic change,” it said. “Israel is bound under international law to allow the unhindered passage of humanitarian aid.” - The Washington Post",2025-04-23 21:42:57,30,Crossstoney,worldnews

> The total number of violations by the Russian army of Russia’s own ceasefire promise throughout the day reached 2,935. The highest number of shellings and assaults occurred in the Pokrovsk direction. Russia’s promise of a full ceasefire also did not apply to the Kursk direction. Overall, across the frontline, there were 96 Russian assaults, 1,882 instances of shelling on our positions, including 812 involving heavy weaponry, and over 950 instances of FPV drone use by Russian forces.

> This day was not enough for Moscow to respond either to the proposal for a full 30-day ceasefire after Easter, or to the proposal to at least extend the ceasefire in the sky, refraining from missile and drone strikes on civilian infrastructure. The nature of Ukraine’s actions will remain symmetrical: ceasefire will be met with ceasefire, and Russian strikes will be met with our own in defense. Actions always speak louder than words.

Russian units attempted to break through the positions of the 28th Mechanized Brigade near Toretsk.

The press service of the brigade published the video of their interception and elimination.

The enemy was detected thanks to scouts who noticed the movement of enemy motorcycles on a rural road in the direction of the brigade’s positions.
After the enemy began to hide, the brigade’s drones with ammunition drop systems took over to eliminate individual Russian assault troops.    

“Under heavy fire, the Russian servicemen fled into the forest belt, where they were systematically destroyed one by one by the drone operators of the Kurt&Company unit, as well as recon platoons from the 3rd and 2nd mechanized battalions. Our comrades from the Phoenix unit and the 93rd Separate Mechanized Brigade “Kholodnyi Yar” also joined in the destruction of the enemy,” the press service of the 28th Brigade reported.

The drone operators from adjacent units were also involved in the operation, hunting both the enemy’s manpower and equipment to prevent their retreat.

Despite the Easter ceasefire proposed by Putin and supported by the Ukrainian side, the Russians did not abandon their attempts to seize the positions of the Ukrainian Defense Forces on the front line.

As a result, Ukrainian defenders on the Toretsk front were ambushed by the Russians, which caused outrage from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

“Unfortunately, our soldiers fell into a Russian ambush in the Toretsk direction. There are casualties. The Russian soldiers who carried this out will be neutralized,” he wrote on his Telegram account.

Meanwhile, after breaking out of the encirclement in Toretsk, the Defense Forces units organized a new defensive line, which is currently a priority target for the enemy.

Militarnyi previously reported that the soldiers of the 28th Mechanized Brigade together with the adjacent units of the 1004th Brigade had repelled an assault by Russian invaders who had attacked as part of an armored convoy in the Toretsk sector.",2025-04-21 16:30:38,39,Well-Sourced,worldnews

Each $1 drop in the price of oil costs the Russian budget roughly 160 billion rubles ($1.9 billion) in annual lost revenue, according to investment banker Yevgeny Kogan.

A $10 drop in the price of Russian crude from $65 to $55 per barrel could reduce GDP growth by at least 0.5 percentage points and wipe out roughly 1 trillion rubles ($12.2 billion) in budget revenue, said Sofia Donets, chief economist at T-Investments.

Because oil and gas taxes are denominated in dollars, a stronger ruble reduces their value in ruble terms — adding further strain on the federal budget.

Under these conditions, the budget deficit in 2025 could exceed the Finance Ministry’s plan by 2 to 2.5 trillion rubles ($24.3 billion-$30.4 billion) due to the loss of oil and gas revenue, analysts at the think tank Tverdye Tsifry estimate.",2025-04-21 23:24:01,34,Logical_Welder3467,worldnews

A solar power station with a capacity of 0.8 MW covering more than 3,000 square meters has been inaugurated in the Chornobyl exclusion zone, Ukrinform reported. Ukraine’s Minister of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources Svitlana Hrynchuk and Spanish Ambassador Ricardo López-Aranda Jagu visited the exclusion zone on 12 April 2025 to open the facility.

The solar energy facility was a project initiated in 2019 as part of Ukraine’s cooperation with the Spanish government on climate change and innovative technology. Although the project faced delays due to Russia’s full-scale invasion, construction continued, and it has now been completed.

The Minister emphasized the importance of such facilities, especially as Ukraine’s power generation has suffered significant losses during the ongoing Russian attacks on energy infrastructure. She highlighted that the Chornobyl zone is well-suited for renewable energy projects due to its infrastructure from the former nuclear power plant and its special status, allowing for faster implementation and connection to the energy grid.

The solar station, with a capacity of 0.8 MW, cost 30 million hryvnias ($725,000), including all infrastructure.

Hrynchuk also announced the launch of a second similar station in Ukraine at the beginning of summer. “I very much hope that in early summer we will invite you to the opening of a second such station, which will be more powerful, and we will continue to develop in this direction. Today’s station is almost 1 MW, to be precise – 0.8 MW. It may not seem like much, but believe me, every kilowatt of energy generated, every kilowatt of electricity matters for supporting our energy system and developing renewable energy,” the minister emphasized.",2025-04-12 14:41:23,33,Well-Sourced,worldnews

The Norwegian government discussed and approved an increase in assistance to Ukraine by NOK 50 billion (US$4.6 billion) for 2025, bringing the total to NOK 85 billion (US$7.8 billion), during a meeting on 4 April.

Stoltenberg noted that the Norwegian government has approved a support package totalling NOK 50 billion in addition to the previous NOK 35 billion aid.

This brings the total amount of funding to support Ukraine this year to NOK 85 billion.

""We are tripling our military support,"" the minister stated, noting that the funds will be allocated abroad, ensuring no strain on the Norwegian economy.

Earlier, Oslo approved the NOK 75 billion (about US$7 billion) Nansen programme, which guarantees long-term support for Ukraine until 2027, providing NOK 15 billion (about US$1.4 billion) annually.

I highly suggest everyone do a little reading up on it, but the short is the US is basically holding a gun to the world economy (and in Europe threatening to back out defensively) wanting everyone to accept a weakened dollar, restructure US debt and to increase the value of their own currencies.  This is probably with an addendum of simultaneous causing as much pain as possible to China to where they get on board and stop depressing their own currency (something that would kill their already fragile economy), or just letting the situation devolve for them economically until they can somehow find a replacement to the US market in the aggregate.  

Repercussions for the war seem hard to formalize, however one thing is for certain, a short term recession is by design to a certain extent in that plan.  Oil prices as a whole are going to continue to sink as the US shoots itself in the foot on purpose (some sources are stating OPEC's increase in production was timed with Trump's announcement in order to try and curb market impact).

Slovakia has raised €5.1 million for weapons for the Ukrainian Armed Forces as part of the Ammunition for Ukraine charity initiative despite the position of the country’s government, led by Robert Fico, Ukrinform reports.

The All for Ukraine – Support for Ukraine (All4Ukraine) charitable foundation, together with its foreign partners in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, launched the project in April 2024.

The goal was to raise funds primarily in Slovakia as part of the Czech Initiative to purchase shells for the Ukrainian soldiers. The organizers say that they planned to raise “a few hundred thousand euros” to purchase ammunition on behalf of the Slovak people, “but everything went differently.”

“The Ammunition for Ukraine initiative, launched at the beginning of 2024, caused an explosive effect, becoming a kind of protest against the policy of the Robert Fico government,” the foundation says.

It was supported by prominent figures both in Slovakia and abroad. By February 2025, it became the largest crowdfunding campaign in Slovakia’s history, raising an unprecedented €5.1 million from over 75,000 individual donors.

“The campaign has emerged in response to the Slovak government’s refusal to join the international efforts led by the Czech Republic to supply Ukraine with ammunition, under the ‘If the government won’t do it, we will’ slogan,” the foundation continues.


The campaign received significant international recognition, with coverage by the BBC, Reuters, The Wall Street Journal, and Politico. The organizers explain that the raised funds were used to purchase 2,700 units of 122mm artillery shells and additional mortar rounds, which were successfully delivered to Ukraine.

“The initiative not only provided significant military support but also became a powerful civic demonstration, showing that civil society can play a decisive role in shaping foreign policy, even when governments hesitate,” the statement resumes.

Earlier, on 21 March, thousands of people took to the streets of the Slovak capital, Bratislava, and other cities to protest against Prime Minister Fico’s pro-Russian policies.

Previously, Fico stated that the Slovak government would not support Ukraine financially or militarily in its struggle against Russia.",2025-04-04 11:37:12,34,Well-Sourced,worldnews

War leaves behind more than ruins and destroyed cities — it carves an invisible mark in the form of the missing and the dead. One of the most painful and challenging aspects of war is the fate of fallen soldiers, whose bodies remain on the battlefield, in trenches, on minefields, or in occupied territories.

According to Ukrainian officials, at least 55,000 people were considered missing as a result of the Russian-Ukrainian war as of September 2024. At least 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in 2022, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Ukrainian photographer Viacheslav Ratynskyi joined Platsdarm (Bridgehead in Ukrainian) Organization for several missions to recover fallen soldiers in Kharkiv and Donetsk oblasts in October 2024 and January 2025.

Platsdarm is a group of volunteers founded by Oleksii Yukov in 2014, when Russia launched its initial invasion of Ukraine. Since the beginning of Moscow’s full-scale war, Platsdarm has found the bodies of more than 3,000 fallen Ukrainian soldiers.

The strike, delivered on the night of April 5, damaged the production line, storage facilities, and administrative buildings. A nitric acid leak was also reported in the area.

While the regional governor Fedorishchev did not disclose the name of the targeted facility or the nature of the incident, details were later revealed by the Dosye_shpiona Telegram channel, known for its links to Russian intelligence services. 

Promsintez is considered one of Russia’s leading producers of industrial explosives. According to the Telegram channel, the facility was hit by 13 strike drones. As a result, critical production units sustained heavy damage — including lines for the nitration of pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), TNT, and benzene. 

According to the insiders, a TNT production line was hit. Administrative buildings, finished product storage sites, and chemical reagent tanks were among the affected targets as well. The report also mentioned secondary detonations at the site, caused by the nature of the materials produced there. 

Following the attack, Russian opposition media ASTRA reported a nitric acid leak at the plant, although local authorities have denied or concealed the incident.

* Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated on April 9 that Ukraine is interested in purchasing a large package of weapons from the United States, possibly within the framework of a future US-Ukraine mineral deal, as part of Ukrainian efforts to obtain security guarantees that would deter a future Russian invasion.
* Russia’s continued unsubstantiated accusations of Ukrainian violations of the energy strike ceasefire - despite the lack of any publicly available official ceasefire agreement – demonstrate how Russia will likely act in the event that Russia accepts the ground ceasefire to which Ukraine and the United States have already agreed
* Russia continues to use bilateral talks with the United States to delay negotiations about the war in Ukraine, suggesting that the Kremlin remains uninterested in serious peace negotiations to end the war.
* Russia is reportedly using social media and financial incentives to recruit Chinese nationals to voluntarily join the Russian military.
* Russian forces reportedly recently executed a wounded Ukrainian prisoner of war (POW) in the Lyman direction.
* The Kremlin continues to use narratives it has historically used against Ukraine to set conditions to justify possible future aggression against Estonia.
* Ukrainian forces recently advanced near Chasiv Yar, and Russian forces advanced near Toretsk and Pokrovsk.
* A Russian insider source claimed that Russian authorities are preparing a dedicated position in Russian regional governments that will oversee veterans' affairs, and the federal government may include similar positions in the future.",2025-04-11 16:56:22,37,Glavurdan,worldnews

We, as humans, may be scared, but at least we understand what's happening. For them, the world suddenly becomes dangerous, noisy, and hostile,"" the rescue center said.

Workers at the Wild Animals Rescue Center explained that the animals, many of whom have suffered from human cruelty, now face a new threat from the war and Russian attacks, preventing them from living in peace.

""Every time we enter the enclosures after nighttime attacks, we’re filled with fear, hoping everyone is alive,"" the post reads.

""We urgently want to evacuate them abroad, to a safe place, before it’s too late. While they’re still with us.""",2025-04-11 11:45:59,36,Well-Sourced,worldnews

Russian authorities stole more than 1.7 million items of Ukrainian cultural heritage from occupied territories, Culture Minister Mykola Tochitsky said on April 11.

“In the occupied territories, 1,700,000 pieces of our cultural heritage were taken—from archaeological artifacts to museum collections that the Russian Federation has claimed for itself, in flagrant violation of international law,” Tochitsky said in an interview with state news agency Ukrinform.

“When, in the past, Russians stole our name and history, they exported exhibits to the Hermitage [museum in St. Petersburg] or to museums in Moscow. Now, they trade these items on the black market.”

Through cooperation with various countries, Ukraine is gradually recovering the cultural treasures stolen by Moscow, he added.

“During foreign visits—including those by the head of state and on my own trips—foreign authorities have repeatedly returned artifacts that were taken from occupied territories and exported for sale on the black market,” the minister said.

Tochitsky also accused Russian officials of being involved in the theft of Ukraine’s cultural heritage.

[Prune with a link to the MT article](https://bsky.app/profile/prune602.bsky.social/post/3lmx4jx3nks2m)

China's stated reason for declining this proposal is cost. Naturally I have several questions. ""Is cost the true reason or is China wary of depending on Russia too much for energy?"" ""Is China trying to hardball Russia or seek a better deal due to Russian desperation?"" 

I remember when the west put a ton of sanctions on Russia there were lots of people arguing that Russia would be fine because they could just sell energy (and everything else) to China. If the biggest issue is genuinely cost then I think it goes to show how flawed that argument was. China cannot replace Europe as a market for gas meanwhile Gazprom has been reduced to trying to sell washing machines and fridges to make up for shortfalls in revenue.",2025-04-16 17:38:10,48,socialistrob,worldnews

A record-breaking French-British air operation saw NATO fighter jets make a close approach to Crimea and the rare use of carrier-based aircraft and a U2 spy plane,  a leading Russian military information platform confirmed Tuesday.

At least thirteen military aircraft launched from bases in Britain, Romania, Italy, France and the Marine Nationale’s aircraft carrier, the Charles De Gaulle, converged in and around air space over the western Black Sea in a multinational operation flown on April 11, the widely read Dva Majora milblogger reported to more than 1.3 million subscribers.

The official Russian state news platform Pravda confirmed that report on Wednesday.

Seven NATO aircraft carried out simultaneous monitoring and surveillance of airspace and land installations between Romania and the Crimean peninsula, and another eight tactical aircraft – among them flying tankers and fighter jets – backed up the operation, the Russian platforms said.

Western sources confirmed that the major air surveillance operation, flown mostly of Service Aéronautique and Royal Air Force aircraft, remained in international airspace, and that Russian air and land forces appeared not to have interfered with it.

NATO flies daily patrols over eastern Romania and over the seas eastward, but usually with three or fewer aircraft. Approaches towards Crimea – a Ukrainian territory occupied by Russia and containing a major Russian military base and a dense air defense network – take place rarely.

Based on open-source flight tracking data, the April 11 operation was most massive air surveillance operation mounted by NATO in a single day in the Black Sea at least since Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, and probably ever, Kyiv Post review of flight tracking data found.

Per the Russian report, aircraft detected in the general area included a US Air Force U2S “Dragon Lady” high-altitude spy plane, a US Navy Poseidon P-8A maritime surveillance plane, a NATO (Luxembourg) E-3A AWACS air space monitoring plane, a French Air Force E-3F air space monitoring plane, a French Navy  Atlantic 1150 maritime surveillance plane,  and a French Navy E-2D Hawkeye air space monitoring plane.

Based on open-source flight tracking data, it was possibly the first time, ever, both an American U2 spy plane and the French aircraft carrier launched Hawkeye had entered airspace on the NATO south-east sea frontier, Kyiv Post researchers found.

However, that tracking data does not register the presence of aircraft with transponders turned off, so both aircraft might have flown missions in the area previously and not been picked up on civilian air tracking networks.

Based on open-source data, no French aircraft closed nearer than 200 kilometers (124 miles) from the western shore of the Crimean Peninsula.

According to the Russian source, the French Hawkeye, flown from the Charles De Gaulle in the Mediterranean, was escorted by a pair of Rafale fighter jets launched from the carrier, and two more Rafales based at Robinson Air Base in France.

The closest aircraft approach to Russia-claimed airspace of the day was made by three British aircraft – an RC-135 Rivet Joint surveillance plane escorted by two Typhoon fighters – all launched from the UK. The RC-135’s primary design function is to detect and fix the location of emitters, like communications nodes and air defense radars.

The Royal Air Force aircraft trio approached to within 130 kilometers (81 miles) of Crimea’s south-western Cape Fiolent before turning back. No incidents or Russian interference was reported.

On Sept. 29 2022, a Russian fighter pilot fired a missile at a British spy plane flying over international waters near Crimea. The missile missed its target. London and Moscow later said it was an accident.

The Kremlin made no direct comment on the intensified NATO air activity, but in the past has called such operations dangerous and provocative.

Dva Mayora: “Such intensity is a very alarming sign that could indicate upcoming massive attacks in the Black Sea area. So we should remain extremely vigilant.”

Western information sources generally confirmed Russian reports, but with slight differences in details. The French maritime news platform, La Marin, confirmed 13 mixed British and French aircraft had participated in an air intelligence operation over the Black Sea, including planes from the Charles De Gaulle, but did not mention US presence and stated that some Royal Air Force planes had been based in Cyprus.

The Italian military air operations tracker, Itamilradar, likewise confirmed a total 13 aircraft participating in the operation, naming some aircraft tail numbers and call signs. One flying tanker flew in from Cyprus, and one and possibly more of the French Rafale fighter planes, besides flying escort, performed air surveillance on their own, that source said.

The UK Defence Journal said: “French and British forces carried out a high-profile aerial operation over the western Black Sea this week, showcasing a coordinated display of reconnaissance and air superiority…The mission’s scale and complexity suggest a clear intent by both London and Paris to maintain pressure on Russia.”",2025-04-16 20:24:33,38,Well-Sourced,worldnews

| New Voice of Ukraine](https://english.nv.ua/nation/north-korean-troops-learn-drone-tactics-fighting-with-russia-in-kursk-oblast-50506821.html)

North Korean troops fighting alongside Russian invaders in Kursk Oblast have learned to use drones and electronic warfare tactics, according to Andriy Chernyak, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s military intelligence, in an interview with Japan’s NHK on April 16.

North Korean troops fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine are learning and adapting to battlefield conditions, according to Ukrainian military intelligence. ""Unfortunately, we’re seeing an evolution — the North Korean military is learning,"" said Andriy Chernyak, a representative of Ukraine’s defense intelligence agency.

Chernyak said that while North Korean troops initially launched large-scale assaults and were quickly destroyed by Ukrainian artillery and drones, they have since shifted tactics, now moving in groups of one or two. He added that North Korean soldiers have picked up drone warfare and electronic warfare tactics, and are effectively using the same weapons and strategies deployed by Russia.

According to GUR, North Korea has lost around 5,000 soldiers in Ukraine so far, with another 6,000 deployed near the Russian border in Kursk Oblast.

Despite a language barrier, Chernyak said North Korean units are carrying out frontline assault duties independently, often without direct communication with Russian commanders. ""They receive basic instructions to advance to a certain line, and once they reach it, they dig in,"" he said.

Ukrainian intelligence also believes that Russia is weighing a possible offensive in northeastern Ukraine, in Sumy and Kharkiv oblasts, and may deploy North Korean troops in those operations.

On April 11, Ukraine’s Armed Forces reported that North Korea had lost more than 4,000 troops fighting in the Kursk area alone.

In late November, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un declared support for Russia’s right to ""self-defense"" in response to strikes on its territory, pledging closer ties under a strategic partnership signed with Russian President Vladimir Putin in June 2024.

North Korea reportedly sent 10,000 to 12,000 troops to Russia in fall 2024, according to Western intelligence. Since then, DPRK troops have taken part in battles against Ukrainian forces near Kursk and continue to suffer heavy casualties. On March 27, South Korea’s military reported that Pyongyang likely deployed an additional 3,000 soldiers to Russia in January and February to support the war effort.

Kyiv forces are employing a new demining method developed by a Ukrainian soldier. The device, called Spalakh or Flash, was created by Andrii, an engineering platoon commander known as Lisnyk, Ukrinform reports.

The creation of the modular shaped-charge system deployed by Ukrainian troops in Kharkiv Oblast has been inspired by similar foreign technologies and is designed to neutralize explosive devices with precision, sending fragments only a few meters away. Remarkably, it uses 20 times less plastic explosive than traditional methods.

“To destroy a standard 152mm artillery shell, you’d typically need 800 grams to 1 kg of TNT blocks. Our shaped-charge device only needs 50 grams,” Lisnyk explains.

The device is primarily made of plastic, with parts produced on a 3D printer. Only the shaped-charge cone is made of copper.

According to the Ukrainian developer, the Spalakh can safely neutralize a wide range of munitions—from anti-personnel mines like the Petal to guided aerial bombs.

“About three months ago, a guided bomb landed near our positions but didn’t detonate. It was too close to the enemy to remove, so we dismantled it on-site—using just 50 grams of explosives,” he says.

To date, his platoon has destroyed more than 500 explosive devices using this method.

Both Spalakh and an enhanced version, Spalakh+, have passed official testing and received codification from the Ministry of Defense, allowing for official procurement.

A private company manufactures the devices using 3D printing. Each unit costs about $12, and production could scale up to 20,000 units per month, though that expansion is not currently underway.",2025-04-16 13:08:24,54,Well-Sourced,worldnews

Several teams of Danish soldiers are set to be deployed to Ukraine.

They will be unarmed and drawn from various military regiments.

The Danish command is particularly interested in Ukraine's three years of frontline experience with drone warfare.

""In my 42 years of service in the armed forces, I have never seen events develop so quickly,"" said Major General Peter Boysen, after observing the training of a reconnaissance regiment using advanced attack drones similar to those deployed on the front line in Ukraine.

Boysen asserts that the adoption of new weapons systems and warfare methods by the Danish Armed Forces stems from his two recent visits to Ukraine.

He now aims to accelerate the process by sending more teams of Danish soldiers to training camps in Ukraine.

The number of training courses has not yet been finalised, but Boysen told TV 2 that both instructors and soldiers are expected to take part in sessions lasting one to two weeks, possibly starting as early as this summer.

""We are sending several teams there to see first-hand what experience the Ukrainians have. So come and get this experience,"" he said.

""Yes, I've been there several times. But these soldiers aren't going there to take an active part in the war. They're going there to gain some experience, and this is at the invitation of my counterpart, the commander of the Ukrainian military,"" said Boysen.

Meanwhile, the Russian Embassy in Copenhagen has expressed outrage over the Danish Armed Forces' plan to send personnel to a training camp in Ukraine.

""Sending Danish troops to Ukraine, including to study combat experience, draws Denmark deeper and deeper into the conflict in Ukraine and provokes its further uncontrolled escalation,"" Russian Ambassador Vladimir Barbin said in a written comment to TV 2.

In response, Boysen emphasised that the soldiers would be unarmed and deployed far from the front line, likely at a training centre in Ukraine's west.

""They will be trained far from the front line, for example, in Lviv in Ukraine's west. And if there is a missile attack, the Ukrainians have outstanding warning systems and good shelters. I myself spent time in one of them in Kyiv,"" Boysen said.",2025-04-16 12:59:39,32,Well-Sourced,worldnews

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) detained nine agents of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), including five minors aged 14–15, for plotting terrorist attacks in central and eastern Ukraine, the agency said on April 16.

According to the SBU, the network operated across four regions and was planning to target residential areas and a Ukrainian military base with explosives.

The news follows a string of similar cases involving Russia recruiting underage Ukrainians to carry out sabotage, arson, and terrorist attacks across the country.

The group intended to blow up key infrastructure, including bridges and mainline railway tracks used by Ukrainian Railways (Ukrzaliznytsia), to disrupt military logistics, the SBU said.

The investigation found that the suspects, all local residents, were recruited through Telegram messenger channels and acted under the guidance of two FSB officers.

The network was reportedly divided into two operational cells: one responsible for manufacturing and storing homemade explosives, and the other for deploying them at designated targets.

Hidden cameras were placed near the explosives so that Russian operatives could monitor and remotely trigger the blasts.

The SBU said it intervened before any attacks could take place, arresting all members of the network and seizing more than 30 kilograms of explosives. Four of the detainees have been formally charged with high treason and illegal handling of explosives.

The two FSB officers who allegedly coordinated the operation have been charged in absentia. Ukrainian authorities are currently determining how to proceed legally with the juvenile suspects.

The March fires destroyed six units of traction rolling stock in Moscow, Samara, and Tver oblasts, as well as nine railway signaling, centralization, and interlocking devices in the Republic of Mari El, Stavropol, and Krasnoyarsk regions, according to military intelligence.

In Moscow Oblast, a power transformer and a tank car with fuel also burned down.

""The fight against the supply of ammunition and military equipment to the Russian occupation army by rail continues,"" the statement read.

In late March, the Atesh partisan group sabotaged a railway line in Russia's Smolensk Oblast, disrupting the transport of military cargo toward Bryansk and Kursk oblasts.

Ukrainian forces will fight even with ""their bare hands"" if they do not receive conditions acceptable for lasting peace, CIA Director John Ratcliffe said during a U.S. Senate hearing on March 25.

""I want to say that with regard to the Ukrainian resistance, the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian military have been underestimated for a period of several years now,"" Ratcliffe said.

""From my reflections in observing, from an intelligence standpoint, I'm convinced that they will fight with their bare hands if they have to, if they don't have terms that are acceptable to an enduring peace.""

The statement comes amid U.S. President Donald Trump's ongoing efforts to broker a ceasefire and a broader peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine. 

Ratcliffe said that Trump is seeking to end the war under conditions that will ensure a lasting peace. He added that the CIA has taken steps to support Trump's diplomatic efforts.

In a deal brokered by the U.S., Moscow and Kyiv have agreed to a ban on strikes targeting energy infrastructure in both Ukraine and Russia. In addition, the belligerent parties agreed to ""eliminate the use of force"" and prevent commercial vessels from being used for military purposes in the Black Sea.

The U.S. and Ukraine initially backed a broader 30-day ceasefire during talks in Jeddah on March 11, which included halting ground operations.

We have spoken about increasing the number of Mirage fighter jets.

I think we want Russia to keep attacking tbh. Supposedly most attacks get broken up before reaching Ukraine's lines, so mostly they just give Ukraine the chance to inflict more losses on Russia. Very few of the successful attacks are ""meaningful"" in terms of territory gains.

> The enemy is attempting to advance into Rozlyv, in the Kurakhove direction. They rush on motorcycles or on foot, some even reached the outermost houses, where they found their final resting place.

> Today, under the cover of fog, they tried to advance using armored fighting vehicles and tanks, achieving some success due to the weather conditions.

> Fighting is currently ongoing, with our guys steadily working to eliminate the enemy. The enemy, in turn, continues sending in more assault groups, but so far, it hasn't brought them much success — our airborne troops are handling the situation well.

Lp(a) basically drags and drops cholesterol to your heart - it's like LDL (the bad cholesterol). 

  
Lp(a) was considered an independent risk - very little can be done to lower its effects. So if this drug passes the FDA gauntlet without a CRL (rejection), it's gonna be a game changer with some real money for LLY.

Lp(a) is a genetically inherited risk factor for heart disease that affects approximately 1.4 billion people worldwide. Unlike LDL cholesterol, which can be managed through diet and statins, there are currently no approved treatments for Lp(a).

  


The study demonstrated that lepodisiran, a small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapy, achieved significant reductions at the highest tested dose (400 mg) and also showed effectiveness at lower doses, with the 16 mg and 96 mg doses reducing Lp(a) levels by 40.8% and 75.2% respectively. After a second 400 mg dose given at the six-month mark, participants experienced an average reduction of nearly 95% over 12 months.

  


No serious adverse events were reported in the trial. The findings were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. While these results are promising, larger trials are still needed to prove that lowering Lp(a) actually reduces heart attacks.

mli8kca,1jrknpu,reddit,"The 46% tariffs trump put on Vietnam have nothing to do with Vietnamese tariffs. 

The so called “reciprocal tariffs” are calculated based on the trade deficit and amount of total trade with each country. It’s just the amount we imported divided by the total trade divided by 2. 

“U.S. goods trade with Vietnam totaled an estimated $149.6 billion in 2024. U.S. goods exports to Vietnam in 2024 were $13.1 billion, up 32.9 percent ($3.2 billion) from 2023. U.S. goods imports from Vietnam totaled $136.6 billion in 2024, up 19.3 percent ($22.1 billion) from 2023.”

https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/southeast-asia-pacific/vietnam

136.6 / 149.6 / 2 is 45.6% which rounds up to 46%. 

Vietnamese tariffs actually average 9.6%

So it is worth realizing that when Trump talks about all the manufacturing jobs that American has lost, even if the jobs had never gone to China, the American workers would have been replaced by robots anyways.

moauhz7,1k4lcqr,reddit,"TEL AVIV — Israel’s far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, drew outrage Monday when he said returning Israeli hostages still held by Hamas is not the war’s “most important goal.”

Instead, with an ally like President Donald Trump in office, Israel should reconquer the Gaza Strip, expel its Palestinian residents and occupy the land, he said.

“Bringing the hostages home is important, but it’s not the most important goal,” Smotrich said Monday in an interview with a local right-wing radio station. “The alternative to surrender is seizing the territory in the Gaza Strip and destroying Hamas.”

He said “excuses” had prevented Israel from retaking Gaza in the past — including pressure from the Biden administration and a defense minister, Yoav Gallant, who wanted a hostage deal to end the war — but that they were no longer “relevant.”

The comments unleashed a storm of condemnations from Israeli politicians, including some serving in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government.

Kuzbass is likely one of the worst hit and they're only small. Moscow did much better last year, but there's a chance that regions will see increasing and cascading financial pain starting now.

Russian air defenses on April 23 opened fire against drones in the Alabuga Special Economic Zone in Russia's Tatarstan, the site of a Shahed-type drone factory, independent news channel Astra reported.

Astra and other Telegram channels shared purported footage of a drone being shot down. Shot channel identified the drones as Aeroprakt A-22 and UJ-22 Airborne unmanned aircraft.

Russian air defenses shot down one Ukrainian airplane-type drone in Tatarstan at about 12:20 p.m. local time, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed, without providing further details or mentioning Alabuga.

The Ukrainian military has not commented on the claims, which could not be independently verified.

Alabuga lies more than 1,000 kilometers (over 600 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border. Ukrainian long-range drones struck the facility last April, aiming to disrupt Russian production of Shaheds and their Russian-made variants, Gerans, which are widely used in aerial attacks against Ukraine.

Over 6,000 Shahed-type drones were produced in Alabuga last year, as well as thousands of decoy drones used to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses, said Andrii Kovalenko, an official at Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council.

""This year, Russia aims to produce 8,000-10,000 Shaheds/Gerans and 15,000 decoys in Alabuga,"" Kovalenko said.

Throughout the full-scale war, Ukrainian long-range drones have targeted Russia's industrial and military facilities deep in the rear to undermine its ability to wage its all-out war.

[NOELREPORTS | BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/noelreports.com/post/3lni5wqumps2d)

Ukrainian drones have struck the Shahed production plant in Yelabuga, Tatarstan—over 1,200 km from Ukraine’s border. According to military sources, 5 out of 6 drones hit their target directly. Each UAV carried 400–420kg of payload, plus fuel.

monnrc9,1k5q53n,reddit," Trumps ""peace talks"" seemingly are nearing their end. I do somewhat worry about if Trump will try to undermine Ukraine going forward by denying intelligence or blocking the small amount of allocated but unsent US aid remaining but vverall these ""peace talks"" were basically always doomed for failure. 

Russia was never going to accept anything short of a crushing Ukrainian defeat especially when Trump is refusing to pass more aid and Ukraine is suffering manpower issues. Ukraine is not going to accept a peace deal that compromises their ability to act as an independent nation especially when Russia is running so low on armor, ammo and financial reserves. Both sides have enough credible chance of victory that accepting a one sided peace deal is nearly unthinkable and the ""minimum acceptable"" deal remains to far apart. 

Trump and Vance fundamentally don't understand what Russia or Ukraine are fighting for nor do they understand the actual front line dynamic. They don't have significant leverage over either side either. Basically every ingredient to actually end the war diplomatically is missing. Right now leaders shouldn't focus too much on what a peace deal could look like and the better option is to focus on helping Ukraine fight the war. Ultimately Ukraine needs leverage over Russia and that leverage can only come from battlefield successes.",2025-04-23 18:58:21,21,socialistrob,worldnews

>Donald Trump will allow Vladimir Putin to keep almost all the territory he seized from Ukraine since recent conflict began under the terms of a proposed peace deal.

>The condition falls within a seven-point plan that aims to bring an end to a war that has so far cost the lives of tens of thousands of people.

>**Ukraine would regain unhindered access to the mouth of the Dnieper river and the second area of Kherson province would also require Russian withdrawal.**

It's the only source I found on this currently, so take it with a grain of salt, but I find it interesting that Trump peace plan envisions Ukraine getting the remainder of Kherson Oblast back.

- Central Bank meets Friday for an important rate decision.
- Russia's budget looks notably worse than last year.
- they sold 67bn rub of debt today at rates of 15.27-16.02%, raising 42bn in revenue. This is slower than their goal.
- central bank rate is 21% but RUONIA interbank rate has dropped towards 20.5%.

There are confusing signals IMO, certainly some people seem to think that Russia will cut interest rates.

High rates are wrecking their finances but cuts should stoke inflation, which is already way way above target. If they cut, expect lots of propaganda about why inflation will definitely go down.

Key takeaways:

* The *Financial Times* (FT) reported that Russian President Vladimir Putin is willing to end the war in Ukraine on the current frontlines. Kremlin officials, including Putin, have repeatedly and explicitly emphasized that Russia maintains its territorial demands over all of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson oblasts, however, while also publicly signaling that Russia has greater territorial ambitions in Ukraine beyond these four oblasts.
* The *Moscow Times* reported that the Kremlin is attempting to use economic incentives to sway US-Russian talks about the war in Ukraine as the Kremlin is not sincerely interested in US President Donald Trump's efforts to end the war. ISW cannot independently verify Kremlin sources' statements, but recent Kremlin behavior is consistent with the *Moscow Times*' insider reporting.
* Any potential future Russian agreement to freeze the front short of Russia's full control of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson oblasts does not preclude future Russian aggression to achieve Russia's more extensive territorial demands, especially if the agreement stipulates a moratorium on Ukraine receiving Western military aid.
* Kremlin officials continued efforts on April 22 to blame Ukraine for the lack of progress towards Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's proposed temporary ceasefire on strikes against civilian infrastructure.
* The Kremlin continues to reject Trump's stated goal of achieving a ceasefire in Ukraine before a full peace settlement to end the war – in contrast to Ukraine's continued support for a general ceasefire.
* Russian forces continue to innovate their long-range drone strike tactics in order to offset the effectiveness of Ukrainian mobile defense units.
* Russia is reportedly recruiting North Korean citizens to compensate for labor shortages in Russia, indicating that Russian-North Korean cooperation continues to deepen.

mjx9ik3,1jkhh8x,reddit,">""This entire story was another hoax written by a Trump-hater who is well-known for his sensationalist spin.”

Typical rebuttal for the Trump administration whenever they get justified criticism of their failings, of which there have been many. Also, is this accusation being made against the reporter who the Trump government included in their Signal chat of their ongoing war plans in the first place?

1. Don't include people in the chat who you don't want to know about your super secret and confidential war plans as they unfold.
2. Don't use consumer grade chat apps for your super secret and confidential war plan discussions.
3. Learn from your mistakes rather than trying to dismiss criticism and covering it up and then continuing as before. 

You would think government officials at that level would know about all this, but they don't. The rot comes from the top.

Not only that, but this conversation about the exact timing and location of strikes was apparently going on before the planes were even in the air, which greatly endangered the lives of those conducting those strikes.

>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth provided the exact timings of warplane launches and when bombs would drop — before the men and women flying those attacks against Yemen’s Houthis this month on behalf of the United States were airborne.

First, the Red Cross and UN coordinated with the IDF, announcing the timing and route of their convoy. When the clearly-marked ambulances and first responders arrived at the pre-designated site with blaring lights and high-vis jackets, they were gunned down. Some of them tried to flee and, over the course of an hour, they were subsequently tracked down and murdered.

The IDF then buried all the bodies, in their uniforms, and buried their ambulance trucks, too, just to be sure, I suppose.

Naturally, the Israeli government claimed they were Hamas infiltrators in blacked out vans. As new evidence emerged contradicting their version of events, the IDF simply adjusted their claim, as needed.

""Cover up"" would be appropriate, after all... they buried the fucking ambulances. But then again, the Israeli government seems to be very comfortable lying to the world, in spite of the evidence our eyes can plainly see. Whether we believe their lies or not, they don't seem to really care.

This is unfortunately routine.

mlmu32y,1jsii3e,reddit,"# [Israel admits mistakes over medic killings in Gaza](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0xp969n69o)

Israel's army has admitted its soldiers made mistakes over [the killing of 15 emergency workers](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crkxm1rg6k1o) in southern Gaza on 23 March – but says some of them were linked to Hamas.

The convoy of Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) ambulances, a UN car and a fire truck from Gaza's Civil Defence came under fire near Rafah.

Israel originally claimed troops opened fire because the convoy approached ""suspiciously"" in darkness without headlights or flashing lights. Movement of the vehicles had not been previously co-ordinated or agreed with the army.

Mobile phone footage, filmed by one of the paramedics who was killed, showed the vehicles did have lights on as they answered a call to help wounded people.

The video, originally shared by the New York Times, shows the vehicles pulling up on the road when, without warning, shooting begins just before dawn.

The footage continues for more than five minutes, with the paramedic, named as Refat Radwan, heard saying his last prayers before the voices of Israeli soldiers are heard approaching the vehicles.

An Israel Defense Forces (IDF) official briefed journalists on Saturday evening, saying the soldiers had earlier fired on a car containing three Hamas members.

When the ambulances responded and approached the area, aerial surveillance monitors informed the soldiers on the ground of the convoy ""advancing suspiciously"".

When the ambulances stopped beside the Hamas car, the soldiers assumed they were under threat and opened fire, despite no evidence any of the emergency team was armed.

Israel has admitted its earlier account claiming the vehicles approached without lights was inaccurate, attributing the report to the troops involved.

The video footage shows the vehicles were clearly marked and the paramedics wore reflective hi-vis uniform.

The soldiers buried the bodies of the 15 dead workers in sand to protect them from wild animals, the official said, claiming the vehicles were moved and buried the following day to clear the road.

They were not uncovered until a week after the incident because international agencies, including the UN, could not organise safe passage to the area or locate the spot.

When an aid team found the bodies they also discovered Refat Radwan's mobile phone containing footage of the incident.

The IDF insists at least six of the medics were linked to Hamas - but has so far provided no evidence. It admits they were unarmed when the soldiers opened fire.

The military official denied any of the medics were handcuffed before they died and said they were not executed at close range, as some reports had suggested.

Earlier this week, [a surviving paramedic told the BBC the ambulances had their lights on](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckgere1y740o) and denied his colleagues were linked with any militant group.

The IDF promised a ""thorough examination"" of the incident, saying it would ""understand the sequence of events and the handling of the situation"".

This is not a problem of the following:

1. Greedy landlords (No, posting stories of landlords being bad and charging high rents does not prove that they cause this problem).

2. Rich foreigners buying up all houses. (To the extent that this is an issue it's like 0.1% of the problem, it is a nothingburger again where you're getting angry at specific groups because anger is addictive and easier than thinking).

3. Airbnb or other services like this. This problem has been trending upwards for years and years, these services are not the issue, though again, it's a good lightning rod because, evil corporations and profts and capitalism = bad.

4. Capitalism/not enough pay etc. 


The reason we do not have enough housing, is because we do not build enough housing. The reasons for that are numerous, the biggest being NIMBYism. We have vast numbers of people who view their homes and the price of said homes as their investment, so price needs to be going up at all times, this is at odds with increasing the supply of housing because it discourages increasing the supply, or building any housing that does not increase the value of the surrounding housing near it. Regulations and other issues also obviously play into it, as well as price of labour and raw materials. The governments of the developed World need to step in in a big way to stimulate and encourage the construction of housing before it fucking destroys us, but because everyone is obsessed with being mad at specific groups (populist BS) they don't get what they want. Also, governments just keep on trying to soothe people with stuff like providing funds for people to get on the property ladder the first time, thus stimulating demand, there is *plenty* of fucking demand, that's the fucking problem.",2025-04-06 13:14:37,1,BruyceWane,worldnews

ml8oaua,1jqpllv,reddit,"Excerpt:

""The world is fast approaching temperature levels where insurers will no longer be able to offer cover for many climate risks, said Günther Thallinger, on the board of Allianz SE, one of the world’s biggest insurance companies. He said that without insurance, which is already being pulled in some places, many other financial services become unviable, from mortgages to investments.

Global carbon emissions are still rising and current policies will result in a rise in global temperature between 2.2C and 3.4C above pre-industrial levels. The damage at 3C will be so great that governments will be unable to provide financial bailouts and it will be impossible to adapt to many climate impacts, said Thallinger, who is also the chair of the German company’s investment board and was previously CEO of Allianz Investment Management.

...Thallinger said it was a systemic risk “threatening the very foundation of the financial sector”, because a lack of insurance means other financial services become unavailable: “This is a climate-induced credit crunch.”

“This applies not only to housing, but to infrastructure, transportation, agriculture, and industry,” he said. “The economic value of entire regions – coastal, arid, wildfire-prone – will begin to vanish from financial ledgers. Markets will reprice, rapidly and brutally. This is what a climate-driven market failure looks like.”",2025-04-03 18:10:38,45,RunAmbitious2593,worldnews

Maybe it made the viewer feel a little sympathetic to the Russian soldier, I'll give critics that much but only very little and in the end the sympathy is gone and you are left with just realizing how stupid the war is and how even the soldiers don't get it. It was all about soldiers who didn't know why they were fighting Ukraine, felt desperate and needed the money and knew they would die. Some were confused between fighting for there country out of patriotism while knowing it was wrong. It showed how unorganized the army was, no.food. shelter, medicine. Soldiers upset at superiors. Older Russians saying that they know it's wrong and they'll be looked at as criminals but that if they don't fight then maybe there sons will. This is not a pro Russian propaganda film. If anything it makes Russia and the military look bad and shows how confused the soldiers are.

Something to think about here—Iran has been on the verge of a civil uprising for years now.  What type of kinetic push would be required to start that?  Again, boots on ground not necessarily needed.

Edit to add here:  re: underground facilities.

Just because they are underground doesn’t mean they can’t be rendered ineffective.  Underground facilities require workers to be…well…underground.  Collapsing tunnels or making the conditions inside incompatible with human life is a thing.  Sure, equipment would still be there—but doesn’t mean you can’t make it impossible to actually use.  You don’t have to worry about enriched uranium if people can’t get it out, or people can’t get in.",2025-04-01 10:46:25,7,CapitalJeep1,worldnews

The US then reportedly gave a demonstration of their own ground penetrator ordinance, which is likely capable of doing the job. 

It's also my understanding that they declined to provide at these weapons to the IDF, but assured Israel that they could rely on the US should the time come. 

So I don't think Israel is capable of launching a strike that can cripple or destroy Iran's nuclear weapons capability, and therefore I think this story is bullshit.",2025-04-17 01:52:13,64,iconocrastinaor,worldnews

motaqx3,1k6v2e9,reddit,"This is a nuanced issue. Canada has largely been shielded from the realities of economic migration due to its 'Safe Third Country' agreement with the U.S. Although Canada has its own problems—particularly those stemming from student visa policies—this agreement effectively positions the U.S. as a barrier, preventing migrants who transit through it from claiming asylum in Canada. The critical question now is whether the U.S. truly qualifies as a 'safe third country.'

I suspect this is the way the system was designed to work.

If people want to go through the long process that has more checks and balances they can apply in the normal way.

For anyone wondering, no, this was not a deep sea submarine like Oceangate, this is a common sort of tourist attraction in many places. They look like [this](https://www.submarinesafaris.com/about-us/our-submarines/) usually. I've seen similar in Tenerife, Mexico, Mallorca and Phuket

The company operating this tour was Sindbad Submarines. [This is their website](https://www.sindbadsubmarines.com/). Their specs are a max dive depths of 25 meters. These boats usually operate very close to the shore and near ports. They have a 44 passenger capacity and have two pilots. It advertises an airconditioned day tour of coral reefs near the harbour (which is where it sank) with hotel pickup, guided tour, etc.

These are *usually* pretty safe. I've been on one in Gran Canaria, and there was a extensive emergency presentation, oxygen masks and even a patrol boat nearby. Would I go to one in Egypt? Probably not. But this company also had good reviews and from what I can tell also had oxygen masks and emergency evacuaton plans, as well as both a boat and a floating platform in the vicinity of the sub, so I wouldn't point fingers at poor quality/improper training just yet.",2025-03-27 11:16:38,547,QuarterTarget,worldnews

mli4odw,1jril9c,reddit,">**Economy Minister Lukas Savickas insists that it is the European Union, not individual countries, that should negotiate with the United States on the tariffs imposed by Donald Trump.**

>“It is very important to maintain solidarity between the different EU member states, to negotiate as one significant, truly economically powerful economic bloc. This is basically what is being done,” he told LRT RADIO on Friday.

>He said that the EU must send a clear signal that it is ready to reach an agreement, to negotiate with the US in the search for a trade balance.

>“I am certainly hearing through both formal and informal channels that the EU commissioners responsible are ready to negotiate. We have to hope that the best case scenario will still happen, but we are also preparing for the other scenario, we are assessing the situation and what is needed to help our companies adapt to the changing situation,” said Savickas.

>According to the minister, the European Commission intends to respond “proportionately” to the US decisions, but keeps stressing that it would be better to reach an agreement and find a compromise without introducing mutual trade barriers.

>US President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that he will impose a 20% duty on imports from the European Union. He did not specify which specific goods would be subject to which specific duties.

>The Lithuanian Ministry of Economy and Innovation forecasts that such an aggressive trade policy would depress Lithuania’s GDP growth by 0.65% points over 3–4 years.

>Lithuania’s direct exports to the US account for about 6.8% of total exports of goods of Lithuanian origin and totalled 1.6 billion euros last year.

>On Thursday, the Ministry of Economy and Innovation presented the first €20 million plan of measures to help businesses potentially affected by tariffs, aimed at mitigating the impact of the trade war launched by the US, and to help diversify markets.

>The Bank of Lithuania had earlier announced that a possible trade war between the US and the EU would reduce Lithuania’s economic growth by 0.33-1.3 points over four years.",2025-04-05 06:31:54,6,BubsyFanboy,worldnews

mkqbd6c,1joaroe,reddit,"Heads down, they charge through the knee-high grass reaching speeds of up to 120kph, a hard-wired legacy from the days when Asiatic cheetahs were the top predators on these central Asian grasslands.

A relic from the last ice age, the saiga once rubbed shoulders with the mammoth and woolly rhinoceros. It is incredibly tough, able to survive the worst extremes the steppe can muster. In winter, when temperatures plummet to -45°C, it grows a thick shaggy coat, while its bulbous nose warms the cold air it breathes. In summer, when the mercury can hit 45°C, its nose helps to filter dust, as well as cooling the blood.

Following decades of conservation work, this strange-looking antelope, which wouldn’t be out of place on the set of Star Wars, is back, with more than 2.8 million individuals now roaming the landscape. But 20 years ago, the picture was quite different.

Kazakhstan  is the ninth-largest country in the world and a territory of the former Soviet Union. When communism collapsed in the 1990s, so did the country’s agrarian economy, with a mass exodus of people from the countryside to the cities. Farms were abandoned, livestock disappeared and the state-sponsored harvesting of saiga for meat also came to an end. 

The steppe became lawless, with the saiga at the mercy of poachers who slaughtered the males in huge numbers, their horns much prized for use in traditional medicine in China. This also broke the natural equilibrium, leaving females outnumbering males by as much as 10:1.

Hunting was banned in 1999, but despite the ban being heavily enforced, the population dropped to fewer than 50,000 by 2005. This was the year the Altyn Dala (Golden Steppe) Conservation Initiative was founded, a partnership between the Kazakhstan government, the Association for the Conservation of Biodiversity of Kazakhstan (ACBK), and international groups such as Fauna & Flora, the RSPB and Frankfurt Zoological Society.",2025-03-31 18:49:08,26,hion_8978,worldnews

However, within the actual article, all that they quote her as saying on this matter is:

>""We are looking at the zero emission vehicle mandate which is why some of... that money goes to Tesla, and looking at how we can better support the car manufacturing industry in the UK,"" Reeves said.

This to me reads more like they are considering how they can make the mandate more beneficial to UK manufacturing. I.E., could look at being more beneficial to other companies that are NOT Tesla.

This combined with the increased tax on new EV sales worth over £40k, actually makes it seem like they aren't trying to appease Tesla, contrary to my initial gut reaction reading this.",2025-03-27 12:12:45,436,xcassets,worldnews

mjzzhr1,1jl19jm,reddit,"Current UK tariffs on US cars:

However, the effective cost for importers increases beyond 10% due to the addition of Value Added Tax (VAT). In the UK, VAT is levied at 20% on the total value of the imported car, which includes the cost of the vehicle, the 10% tariff, and shipping costs. For example, if a US car costs $30,000, the tariff adds $3,000 (10%), bringing the taxable value to $33,000 (assuming shipping is negligible for simplicity). The 20% VAT is then applied to $33,000, adding $6,600, making the total cost $39,600—a 32% increase over the original price. While the tariff itself is 10%, the combined effect with VAT significantly raises the cost to the end consumer, though VAT is a domestic tax, not a tariff.""

* **Air Commodore Blythe Crawford said the result ""was not a pretty picture.""**

motz3ft,1k6vzjw,reddit,"From The Times:

Russian missiles overwhelmed the British military in an simulated air attack, it has emerged, prompting calls for homeland defence to be beefed up. 
In 2022, the RAF simulated the first day of the Russian invasion of Ukraine as if the air attack were playing out against the UK. Some of the missiles are understood to have got through the defences. 
Air Commodore Blythe Crawford, who until last week was head of the RAF Air and Space Warfare Centre, said the military had assumed before the exercise that the UK was safe.
• Ukraine-Russia war latest: Trump tells Putin to ‘stop!’ after airstrikes
He told the Royal United Services Institute: “We have stood for years at the western edge of Europe feeling as though the rest of the continent stood between us and the enemy. We in the UK over the last few decades have become focused on being garrison safe, and making assumptions that we are safe to operate from the home base because most of the wars we’ve been fighting have been overseas.
“We need to reverse that thinking and assume that from here on we’re under threat in the home base now as well.”
He said that in 2022, after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the British military simulated “day one” of the conflict. In the war games — part of the RAF’s £36 million Gladiator programme — the UK tried to defend itself from “hundreds of different types of munitions” attacking from several directions.
The result, Crawford said, was “not a pretty picture”. It is understood some of the missiles got through British defences thanks to their sheer volume.

“Ukraine has made us all sit up,” Crawford said. “That drove some of the work we have been doing at the warfare centre to get after how we would solve a problem like that if a similar scenario hit the UK.
“One of the lessons we took away from that was: how do we model and simulate something like that? We [loaded] night one of Ukraine into that synthetic environment and played it out against the UK and, as you can imagine, it was not a pretty picture. It reinforced the fact that we really need to get after this.”
Since the war game, the military has hardened some of its aircraft shelters and practised landing Typhoon aircraft on ice in Finland in its efforts to ensure that aircraft can land in unconventional environments.
It is believed that the situation has improved and if the exercise were now to play out in real life, a lot of the missiles would be intercepted by Nato forces.",2025-04-24 18:20:08,52,DVillain,worldnews

movsv5n,1k6vzjw,reddit,"I really don’t think the UK public has any grasp of just how seriously vulnerable we are to attacks of this nature. “Undefended” is a strong term, but it’s not so far from the truth. 

The UK has no true ballistic missile defence capability beyond half a dozen air defence destroyers. Though individually highly capable, they are too few and are stretched beyond belief already in demand as they are across the globe. They cannot adequately cover all areas of the mainland UK when operating from our coastal areas; have fairly shallow magazines and even then are only capable of intercepting a fairly limited subset of ballistic missile threats. Anything more sophisticated than a medium-range type ballistic missile, and we’d be all but helpless. The only comfort we’d have is we’d be able to track with perfect precision the missiles that were coming to destroy us thanks to the long-range detection radars we possess in the form of the RAF Flying Dales facility and similar installations.

As if to make things worse, the Army has no capability in its arsenal that could make any sort of meaningful contribution to the defence of the UK against a complex missile attack. Though it’s recently taken delivery of a new, and highly capable short-medium range air defence system in the form of Sky Sabre, the number of launch units available to the Army is measured in single digits (no, I’m not exaggerating). Despite this, these systems are expected to provide for the defence of the field Army, our overseas territories, our military installations and other strategically significant sites and more besides. For the time being, any thought of ordering more has not managed to move much beyond mere hopes and aspirations, but we’d need multiple dozens of additional systems to even begin to adequately provide for our true needs - plus all the supporting material that goes into them (missiles to fire from them being a chief concern). Additionally, these systems themselves also have capability limitations against the more sophisticated forms of threat and could not be considered a true ballistic missile defence system. 

The RAF could play some sort of role in defending against a missile attack, but again only against a limited subset of missiles, as was demonstrated by our rather limited contribution to the recent defence of Israel in the face of attacks from Iranian ballistic missile systems. As with all other branches of the military however, the fighter fleet is being stretched to near breaking point. It barely has the mass to meet its routine peacetime commitments let alone anything more demanding. We’re short on fighter pilots due to foul ups in the training pipeline, vital upgrades to the backbone of our front line fast jet fleet are close to a decade late, our stockpiles of munitions are puddle depth, even with the recent order for new AEW aircraft we’ll no longer have a sufficient number of platforms to guarantee a 24/7 watch of UK skies and are lacking in a whole host of other supporting platforms and capabilities that might have otherwise benefitted us thanks to cuts and capability reductions without replacement. 

When I see people glibly dismissing (usually for purely ideological, utterly pig-headed reasons) calls from services chiefs and others about the need for rapid, significant uplifts in our defence spending, or otherwise treating such things with undue cynicism, I can only think to myself “if only you had even half a clue about what’s really going on”.",2025-04-25 00:00:14,6,-UNiOnJaCk-,worldnews

For russian troops to actually land boots on the ground in the UK it would have to be so far along in a war the UK physically couldn’t fight back, which is hard to believe.

mlvhmnh,1jtn2z3,reddit,">*Peskov reiterated the Kremlin’s usual narrative about the mythical ""denazification and demilitarisation"" of Ukraine. He said that the questions requiring answers are linked to ""the lack of control of the Kyiv regime and the inability of the Kyiv regime to control the actions of a number of extremist nationalist units that simply do not obey Kyiv"".*

Well, we have our own doubts and questions.

Like the legitimacy of the current Russian president. If you look at how in 2020 he changed the constitution from a 2-time 6 year term-limit into an unlimited terms while being his own benefactor, than that's basically illegal and a coup. There are also war crimes, terrorism and other extremist nationalistic issues to observe.

At least in the old Russian constitution (version 2010) I can read for example:

>*The constitution of Russia, The Fundamentals of the Constitution System, Article 2:*

>*1. Man, his rights and freedoms shall be the supreme value. The recognition, observance and protection of human and civil rights and freedoms shall be an obligation of the State*  
*4.* ***Nobody*** *may usurp power in the Russian Federation. The seizure of power or usurpation of State authority shall be prosecuted under federal law.*",2025-04-07 15:09:29,12,Marchello_E,worldnews
