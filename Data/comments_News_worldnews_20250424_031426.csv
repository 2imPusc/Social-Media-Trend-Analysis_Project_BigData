Reagan instills neo-liberalism and austerity with his trickle down bullshit as the new US paradigm. Has a huge transfer of wealth from the middle class to the rich.

This continues for decades because the DNC gives up on new deal politics to become wallstreet corporate dems that do much the same but less evil.

Things degrade for decades, wages peel away from profits for decades, inflation goes up, purchasing power slips. Each generation of Americans is functionally poorer than the last despite profits constantly growing. 

Wealth gap keeps widening. 

08 crisis and covid increase this as poor people go bankrupt Megs wealthy buy buy buy.

Americans stupidly blame everyone but the new class of billionaire oligarchs and vote to dismantle all soft power and cut all social safety nets in some mad panic to end the financial pain.

It's a complicated mess, to be sure. But, the system became somewhat dependent on foreign money (varies from place to place), and with the recent cutbacks to foreign students, there is yet another financial crisis in PSE. 

They have to get the finances sorted. I've worked in PSE for decades, and it's almost always a ""famine"" regarding funding. I can count on one hand the number of years we've felt ""secure"" in our economic situation. It can be a constant source of stress.

In response to new tariffs imposed by Donald Trump—26% on Indian imports, 54% on Chinese, and 46% on Vietnamese—Apple and Samsung are increasing production in India to maintain competitiveness in the US market. Apple has already begun shipping iPhones from Indian factories, reducing dependence on China. Samsung, facing $55 billion in exports from Vietnam, is also considering India as a stop-gap manufacturing base. 

This shift supports India's *Make in India* initiative and may trigger large-scale investments by Foxconn and Tata Group. Future manufacturing strategy will depend on US trade negotiations, particularly with Vietnam and other lower-tariff nations like the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Brazil.",443,2025-04-07 02:15:07,BROWN-MUNDA_

Basicly: in the States, the accumulated wealth has not been divided sensibly.

What you get is few people getting ridiculously rich while most people wages and living standard does not improve.

Spain has updated its travel information for those heading to the U.S., with new advice for transgender travelers.

Spain is the latest European nation to update such information for its citizens travelling to the U.S.

Many have already done so, including Britain and Germany, seemingly in reaction to President Donald Trump's sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration and transgender rights.

According to Zelensky, Ukrainian forces killed around 200 Russian soldiers and injured 30 others, as well as destroyed 115 units of Russian military equipment.
There has been a notable slowdown in Russia’s offensive operations after months of steady territorial gains across eastern Ukraine. In recent weeks, Ukrainian forces have liberated approximately 16 square kilometers of territory near Pokrovsk, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on April 17.
The massive attack near Pokrovsk involved Russian armored combat vehicles and motorcycles, as well as about two companies, National GuardCommander Oleksandr Pivnenko said earlier in the day, sharing footage showing the assault.

""This battle is yet another proof of the coordinated and professional actions of our defenders who are holding the front line,"" the commander said.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims.
Ukrainian troops fended off 48 attacks in the Pokrovsk sector over the past day alone, Ukraine's General Staff said in its latest update on April 17.
Zelensky warned that Russia would likely make several attempts to launch offensives in Sumy, Kharkiv, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts.

Anyway, the political talk and headline is just sweet talking things:

U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also gave a public nod to Panamanian sovereignty at the conclusion of the first visit by a Pentagon chief to Panama in decades. Hegseth said he sees the canal as key terrain that Panama would secure together with the U.S. - and not with China.  
""We are helping to take back the Panama Canal from communist Chinese influence,"" Hegseth told a press briefing in Panama City.The Panamanian government has strongly rejected U.S. President Donald Trump's allegations that the key waterway is controlled by China.

USA has increased influence now.

Also: During Hegseth's visit, the U.S. and Panama issued joint statements about deepening security cooperation. But the Pentagon's English-language version did not include a sentence that was in the Spanish-language version published by Panama that spoke about Panama's sovereignty over the canal.

TLDR:  
1. Despite everything, USA has increased influence, to 'take back Canal from Communist China influence'.  
2. USA's version of statement did not include the sentence about Panama's sovereignty over canal.

worldnews,1jj11gy,mjkkbud,"For reference the US currently spends 3.4% of GDP on defense and hasn't spent 5% of GDP on defense sense the Soviet Union broke up. As of 2024 the highest spender in NATO as a percentage of GDP was Poland who spent 4.1% on defense. Typically countries only spend 5% on defense if they are very worried about the prospect of invasion. 5.2% is a level where you are deciding to sacrifice long term economic growth for the sake of the military.

All of that said 5.2% is probably a good number for Lithuania. If the US abandons NATO and the war in Ukraine ends at some level favorable to Russia then Russia very likely could try to invade Lithuania and the other Baltic states. As we've seen in Ukraine once Russia takes territory it can be very hard to push them out so Lithuania is determined to build a military that can halt a Russian push despite the fact that Lithuania is neither large nor particularly rich. We've also seen that it can be very difficult to quickly ramp up production so preparing now for a future crisis makes even more sense.",214,2025-03-24 23:51:23,socialistrob

They forgot that their primacy rested on the foundation of the bargain they offered containing sufficient mutual benefit fir Europe and the USA's other partners. It might have been skewed in favour of the USA (see, the adoption of 7.62mm NATO; and then the adoption of 5.56mm NATO, really,) but the USA's allies and partners still got, and could still see, the benefits. Inertia kicked in- Yankee primacy seemed to be working, seemed to be enduring, and seemed to be... Sufficiently tolerable that wriggling out from under it was just too risky to be worth it.

Then the Yankees got it into their head that because we *hadn't* ended things, we *couldn't* end things. That because they had a hand around us, they could just squeeze and squeeze as tight as they wanted.

worldnews,1jluzyx,mk6ibk5,"TAIPEI, Taiwan — Chinese espionage in Taiwan has reached new levels, analysts and officials say, after three soldiers responsible for guarding the Taiwanese president’s office were jailed for photographing and selling classified information.

Three former members of a military battalion responsible for the security of the presidential building, as well as a soldier from a unit focused on information warfare, were sentenced to up to seven years in prison this week.

“The presidential office should be the most secure place, yet incidents like this still happen. This shows how severe China’s infiltration is in Taiwan,” said Chung Chih-tung, an assistant research fellow at the Institute for National Defense and Security Research, a government-funded think tank.

The cases fit into a broader pattern of intimidation by Beijing as it tries to undermine Taiwan’s defenses both militarily and psychologically, part of a campaign to push the island democracy to surrender to Chinese Communist Party rule.

""Glavprodukt is primarily a Russian company, not an American one. It is a well-known and leading producer of canned foods in Russia, with a wide range of products including canned meat, dairy, vegetables, and fish. The company has been operating in Russia for many years and has become a significant player in the Russian food industry.

However, there's a crucial recent development involving Glavprodukt and its ownership that connects it to an American entity:

 * Ownership by a US Company: Glavprodukt was owned by Universal Beverage Company, which is registered in the United States and belongs to a Russian-born American businessman named Leonid Smirnov.
 
* Seizure by Russian Authorities: In October 2024, the Russian government, through a decree by President Vladimir Putin, placed Glavprodukt under ""temporary management"" of the Russian state. This effectively gave Moscow control over the company's operations.",156,2025-04-17 07:27:03,Outlaw_Josie_Snails

>**US says company's seizure will be part of talks with Russia**

>LONDON, April 17 (Reuters) - Plans are afoot for an American-owned company seized by the Kremlin and placed under state control to be used to supply food to the Russian army, a document seen by Reuters showed, potentially threatening Moscow's warming relations with the U.S.

>As the U.S. and the Kremlin negotiate to stop the war in Ukraine, the canned food maker Glavprodukt which was seized in October and is the only American-owned firm to be taken under state control, has been caught in the crosshairs.

>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said its treatment will be part of the conversation about resetting U.S.-Russia relations.

>The seizure was necessary to ensure stable production, including for future supplies to the national guard and defence ministry, according to a letter, reviewed by Reuters, addressed to Russia’s prosecutor general from Glavprodukt’s new management.

>Glavprodukt is now under the control of Russia’s federal property management agency Rosimushchestvo having been seized from Los Angeles-based Leonid Smirnov.

>Russia’s industry and trade ministry and Rosimushchestvo did not respond to requests for comment on the state's plans for Glavprodukt and questions about its new management.

>Russian prosecutors have accused Smirnov and companies controlled by him of moving about 1.38 billion roubles ($17 million) out of Russia from 2022 to 2024, the RBC daily reported in March.

>On March 12, Glavprodukt's assets were seized by the Moscow Arbitration Court at the request of the prosecutor general’s office. A hearing is scheduled for April 18. Smirnov denies wrongdoing and says the lawsuit is a ""Russian-style corporate raid"" to steal his company.

>The prosecutor general did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

>About a dozen European companies have had their Russian subsidiaries expropriated by presidential decree, including Danish brewer Carlsberg and Finnish utility Fortum and the Kremlin has warned of more asset seizures.

>The Ukraine invasion was expected to be a quick operation, but the war has now stretched to more than three years, seeing Russia hike defence spending and secure tighter control of strategic assets.

Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz announced Wednesday a major expansion of the military’s operation in Gaza involving the seizure of large areas of land that would be “incorporated into Israel’s security zones.”

The operation would also involve “large-scale evacuation of Gaza’s population from combat zones,” the statement said without specifying details.

Katz said the military operation would expand to “crush and clear the area of terrorists and terror infrastructure, while seizing large areas that will be incorporated into Israel’s security zone.”

The Israeli military’s spokesperson for Arabic media late on Tuesday issued an evacuation order to residents in Gaza’s southern Rafah area, ordering them to move north.

Last month, an Israeli official and a second source familiar with the matter told CNN that Israel was making plans for a potential major ground offensive in Gaza that would involve sending tens of thousands of troops into combat to clear and occupy large swaths of the enclave.

Katz’s statement on Wednesday did not specify whether additional Israeli troops would be involved in the expanded operation.",116,2025-04-02 04:33:28,N/A

\--------------------------------------------------------------

According to five informed sources, EU leaders plan to travel to Beijing in late July to hold a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

The plan suggests that, despite the location being meant to rotate, the second consecutive China-EU summit will still be held in Beijing.

However, given Xi's reluctance to travel to Brussels, it is understood that European Council President Antonio Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have accepted that if they wish to meet with the Chinese leader in person, they must go to Beijing.

The specific date has not yet been confirmed with the Chinese side, but the willingness of EU leaders to visit indicates that they are seriously trying to re-engage with Beijing amid the effective rupture in EU-U.S. relations.

After U.S. President Donald Trump returned to the White House, he imposed tariffs on EU goods while making a dramatic geopolitical shift regarding the Ukraine issue, leading Europeans to believe he sided with the invading Russia in the three-year war.

At the request of China's second-in-command, von der Leyen spoke with Chinese Premier Li Qiang on Tuesday, while Trade Minister Maroš Šefčovič spoke with Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao on Wednesday.

According to information released by the Ministry of Commerce, during the video call, Wang and Šefčovič agreed to ""immediately start negotiations on commitments regarding electric vehicle pricing and explore investment cooperation in the China-EU automotive industry.""

In von der Leyen's call with Li, the two sides agreed to monitor the trade diversion effects triggered by Trump's comprehensive global tariff policy.

In particular, Europeans are worried that cheap Chinese goods originally destined for the U.S. may shift to the European market, adding greater pressure on local producers who are already struggling.

This week, as tariffs on goods exported to the U.S. from China were implemented one after another, these concerns became even more pronounced.

Faced with immense economic pressure from the U.S. on both sides, Brussels has been stepping on the brakes in the deteriorating relationship with China, which has reached a new low in recent years due to Beijing’s close ties with Moscow and a series of economic grievances.

**This year, von der Leyen, regarded as one of Europe’s most prominent hawks, has adopted a more moderate tone when discussing China.**

In the Commission's report on her call with Li, her adjusted stance was once again evident, with a lack of mention of traditional grievances such as human rights.

For months, European officials have been trying to persuade Beijing that, considering their visit to China in 2023, the summit should take place in Brussels.

At every crucial juncture, they have been told that Xi has no plans to visit Europe this year.

**In response, European officials stated that Xi does indeed plan to visit Russia next month to participate in commemorative activities for the war alongside President Putin.**

The Chinese government has also long insisted that the summit should be held at the level of Premier Li Keqiang.

However, EU officials pointed out that Xi attended three summits consecutively from 2020 to 2023 (two of which were held online), setting a precedent they hope to retain, especially considering that 2025 marks the 50th anniversary of China-EU diplomatic relations.

Charles Michel, who became the President of the European Council, a political institution composed of the 27 EU member states, at the end of last year, had spoken with Xi in January, and it is widely believed that an invitation to visit Beijing was extended at that time.

When Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Hua Chunying visited Brussels in February, she suggested that von der Leyen and Costa jointly attend and referred to it as a summit.

At that time, the EU still hoped to persuade Xi to visit Belgium. **Now, they seem to have accepted a reality: if they want to meet with the top decision-maker in China, they must accept his conditions.**

This will be part of a series of visits by European leaders to China this year.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez arrived on Thursday; this is his third visit within two years. According to several official sources, French President Emmanuel Macron plans to visit in the second half of this year.",59,2025-04-11 03:33:08,uniyk

>Relief efforts have been hampered by buckled roads, downed bridges, spotty communications and the challenges of operating in a country in the midst of a civil war.

>The search for survivors has been primarily conducted by the local residents without the aid of heavy equipment, moving rubble by hand and with shovels in 41-degree Celsius (106 Fahrenheit) heat, with only the occasional tracked excavator to be seen.

>A 5.1 magnitude aftershock Sunday afternoon prompted screams from those in the streets, and then the work continued.

>Many of Mandalay’s 1.5 million people spent the night sleeping on the streets, either left homeless by the quake, which also shook neighboring Thailand and killed at least 18 people there, or worried that the continuing aftershocks might cause structures left unstable to collapse.

Does it suck to get burned when I've spent so much of my life working against conservative policies? Yes! But Canada has every reason to be pissed and if we really want to support one of our greatest allies in the face of a shared enemy, we should be *supporting* their decision.

And for that matter, I am *begging* people in this state to start paying attention to stuff going on in Kentucky beyond the fucking bourbon. Our governor is being thrashed by a Republican legislature that is overriding everything he's trying to veto, and there are so many nasty house bills going on that are going to impact you and your loved ones. It's now legal to poison most of our waterways because coal companies paid to sponsor a bill! They're trying to implement a Kentucky equivalent of DOGE! Get out there and let your voices be heard! Call your state reps! I know we're outnumbered, *but you gotta fucking try.*

TL;DR: People of Kentucky who hate Trump and his policies, support Canada and face a common foe together. And for the love of fuck, maybe start paying attention to the bills being passed for your state right now. You're in danger of losing a lot more than bourbon.",32,2025-03-29 17:30:17,Ilunibi

NATO's newest member is deploying a fighter jet that is designed for a fight with Russia to protect alliance borders for the first time.

Sweden's armed forces said that six of its Jas 39 Gripen fighter aircraft landed at an air base in Malbork, Poland, on Wednesday to join an alliance airspace surveillance mission.

NATO said this is the first time Sweden's combat aircraft have participated in the alliance's ""enhanced Air Policing mission"" from within another ally's airspace [since it joined in March 2024](https://www.businessinsider.com/sweden-nato-alliance-new-ways-strike-russia-targets-kaliningrad-stpetersburg-2024-3). It previously had only taken part in NATO air policing missions over its own territory, as only a partner nation.

Sweden, along with its neighbor Finland, broke with decades of neutrality to [join NATO](https://www.businessinsider.com/sweden-first-nato-reconnaissance-mission-near-russia-border-ukraine-2024-3), citing [Russia's invasion of Ukraine](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-did-russia-invade-ukraine-putin-politics-motive-2023-6) as their motivation for seeking membership. That was an unintended effect of Russian President Vladimir [Putin's brutal war](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-did-russia-invade-ukraine-putin-politics-motive-2023-6), a stated reason for which was to limit the expansion of the NATO alliance.

These countries [built their militaries with a threat from Russia in mind](https://www.businessinsider.com/sweden-set-join-nato-has-military-for-fighting-russia-expert-2023-7), and the Gripen was one such project.

worldnews,1k1cp6e,mnkxyza,"From the note:

Brazil on Wednesday raised the legal age for transgender people to receive hormone therapy from 16 to 18, becoming the latest country to deny the treatment to minors who do not recognise their birth gender.

Brazil's CFM medicines council had authorised the therapy for people 16 and older in 2019, but on Wednesday published a resolution saying hormone treatment will henceforth be ""prohibited before the age of 18.""

It also banned the prescription of puberty blockers for ""children or adolescents"" with gender dysphoria, which is when a person's gender identity differs from the sex they were assigned at birth.

The CFM raised the minimum age for sexual reassignment surgery ""that involves a potentially sterilising effect"" from 18 to 21 years. 

Several bills seeking to impose prison sentences on doctors providing hormone treatment to minors are under review in the Brazilian Congress, which has a conservative majority.

Brazil's move was the latest blow for transgender rights after Britain's Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that the legal definition of a ""woman"" is based on a person's sex at birth.

Elsewhere in Latin America, Argentina in February banned gender transition procedures for minors, part of President Javier Milei's war on what he calls ""woke ideology.""

Supporters of hormone therapy argue it alleviates the suffering of minors with gender dysphoria by allowing their bodies to develop in line with their gender identity. But it is the subject of growing scientific and legal debate in many countries.

Transgender people have become a flashpoint in the culture wars spearheaded by the United States, which under Donald Trump now only recognises two sexes, male and female, as defined at birth.

Half of US states prohibit hormone treatment for minors. The conservative-leaning Supreme Court is to rule by June 2025 on minors' access to such therapy.

Several other countries that had authorised hormone treatment for transgender minors have recently stepped back as a precaution.",105,2025-04-17 13:27:13,ElRama1

worldnews,1jp51a1,mkwrbgf,"Nuclear re-armament is next (even by those countries which never had nukes before). The NPT is as good as dead. Its entire premise hinged on a shared nuclear aegis provided by the US, which nobody has any faith in anymore.

Not only that, I expect many countries (especially those already recognized nuclear states) to move from only having strategic (WW3 city-killer) nukes, to also having tactical (battlefield) nukes. Because when Putin threatened to use tactical nukes in Ukraine, only the US had their own tac nukes, and even temporarily brought them to Europe to counter Russia's threat. And it worked, Putin backed down from threatening nuclear war when his bluff was called.

Without the West having tactical nukes, Putin would likely have used his own in Ukraine, knowing no country would be able to respond proportionally, yet no country would be willing to start a full-blown WW3 over Ukraine, if they responded to Putin's tactical nukes with strategic nukes.

The obvious drawback is that, if lots of countries have tactical nukes, the chance of escalation to a nuclear war is sharply greater than if only a few have them, as is the risk of nuclear terrorism, because stealing or re-purposing a tactical nuke (the size of a mere artillery shell that can fit in the trunk of any car), under battlefield conditions, is much easier than a large, strategic nuke, which every country having them guards like the Holy Grail.

Ended with the Great Depression.  I'm not an American, but I think brushing up on that act would probably be a good idea.

>In May 1930, Canada, the most loyal trading partner for the U.S., retaliated by imposing new tariffs on 16 products that accounted altogether for approximately 30% of U.S. exports to Canada.[^(\[19\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoot%E2%80%93Hawley_Tariff_Act#cite_note-19) Later, Canada also forged closer economic links with the [British Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire) via the [British Empire Economic Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire_Economic_Conference) of 1932. France and Britain protested and developed new trade partners. Germany developed a system of trade via clearing. 

>The depression worsened for workers and farmers despite Smoot and Hawley's promises of prosperity from high tariffs; consequently, Hawley lost re-nomination, while Smoot was one of 12 Republican Senators who lost their seats in [the 1932 elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1932_United_States_Senate_elections), with the swing being the largest in Senate history (being equaled in [1958](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1958_United_States_Senate_elections) and [1980](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_United_States_Senate_elections)).[^(\[20\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoot%E2%80%93Hawley_Tariff_Act#cite_note-20) Nations other than Canada that enacted retaliatory tariffs included Cuba, Mexico, France, Italy, Spain, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, and Switzerland.[^(\[4\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoot%E2%80%93Hawley_Tariff_Act#cite_note-:2-4)

...

>Unemployment was 8% in 1930 when the Smoot–Hawley Act was passed but the new law failed to lower it. The rate jumped to 16% in 1931 and to 25% in 1932–1933.[^(\[27\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoot%E2%80%93Hawley_Tariff_Act#cite_note-27) 

...

>The 1932 [Democratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)) campaign platform pledged to lower tariffs. After winning the election, President [Franklin D. Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt) and the now-Democratic Congress passed [Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocal_Trade_Agreements_Act) of 1934. This act allowed the president to negotiate tariff reductions on a bilateral basis and treated such a tariff agreement as regular legislation, requiring only a majority, rather than as a treaty requiring a two-thirds vote.

worldnews,1jjc0rl,mjmuogq,"The problem with America is that they've just got a fundamental misread of what's involved here and so they're naturally sympathetic to Russia and so are targeting Ukraine and the EU

And before Americans start squealing that this is Trump, the GOP, MAGA or Conservatives, it's actually 'America'. 

Americans might distinguish their policy epochs by their various regimes, and in many respects its a nice way for them to reset the record and pretend things didn't happen if they can blame a previous government, the rest of the world doesn't however. They view America in the whole. They don't say Bush invaded Iraq. They say America did. So what's going on now isn't Trump, it's America

Anyway

America starts from the position of accepting the legitimacy of a 19th century imperialist philosophy which they call the 'sphere of influence' but which is closer to dominions. So far as America is concerned, Ukraine falls within the Russian sphere of influence. 

This means the eastward expansion of the EU and NATO in the last 25 years is viewed by America as a provocative encroachment into the Russian sphere. In other words, America accepts Russia's explanation that they've been forced to retaliate. It paints the abused victim in the relationship (Ukraine) as the agent provocateur who is disrupting the equilibrium by trying to leave the arrangement. It is tantamount to the 'you made me do it' excuse. 

This is the reason we see America focusing their ire on the Ukrainians for having the temerity to challenge the sphere of influence by seeking the freedom to leave the relationship

It also explains to a lesser extent why America doesn't think they hold any cards. Ukraine's continued existence is a card in itself, and the west's capability of keeping them in the fight is too, but America perversely sees Ukraine as the aggressor here who has disrupted the harmonious status quo and therefore can't countenance further supporting it. In America's view, Ukraine stands to get what they deserve for disrupting this arrangement

America doesn't realise that Russia is the aggressor nor does she realise that Russia is the intransient blocker who'll resist any settlement unless its 95% on their terms.

worldnews,1jjc0rl,mjmswmo,">**European Commission spokesperson Anita Hipper on March 24 reafirrmed the European Union's support for Ukraine's territorial integrity and decried Russia's sham ""referendums"" in illegally occupied regions.**

>U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff on March 21 suggested that Ukrainians living in occupied territories may want to live under Russia, citing so-called ""referendums."" The remarks, which echoed Kremlin propaganda, garnered backlash from Ukraine and its allies.

>The EU does not recognize Russia's ""completely fraudulent"" referendums held ""at gunpoint"" in illegally annexed Ukrainian regions, Hipper said.

>Hipper also condemned Russia's continued attacks on Ukraine and called for Moscow to demonstrate its willingness to end the war.

>""We saw attacks over the weekend, including a strike in Kyiv where three people were killed, including a five-year-old child. So, this shows that Russia still has to demonstrate its true political will to end its illegal and unprovoked aggression,"" Hipper said.

>Hipper's comments came as U.S. and Russian delegations held their latest round of negotiations on a potential ceasefire in Ukraine. Officials spoke for 12 hours in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, without Ukrainian or European participation.

>A Ukrainian delegation met separately with a U.S. team in Riyadh on March 23.

>Ahead of the talks, Witkoff's comments sparked outrage and fears that the U.S. might lend legitimacy to Russia's ongoing occupation of sovereign Ukrainian territory. Russia now partially occupies four Ukrainian regions: Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts.

>In September 2022, Russia annexed the four regions, using sham referendums to justify the seizure of Ukrainian land.

>A Kremlin official reportedly told the Moscow Times on March 24 that Russia aims to cement its control over the four Ukrainian oblasts during peace negotiations with the U.S.

>Russia has also occupied Ukraine's Autonomous Republic of Crimea since 2014.

>When asked if Witkoff's comments indicate that Washington believes Russia has a legitimate claim to Ukrainian territories, U.S. State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce gave an evasive answer.

worldnews,1jxjufb,mmrfqwx,">Currently, cannabis is legal for adult use at a national level in Uruguay, Canada, Malta, Luxembourg, Germany, and South Africa. Additionally, two dozen states in the U.S. have adopted recreational cannabis measures, regional adult-use pilot trials are operating in the Netherlands and Switzerland, and top courts in multiple other countries have ruled against adult-use prohibition policies.

>Chile is another country that may join the list of legalized nations, with lawmakers having recently introduced a measure that would legalize cannabis for adult use in the South American country if approved.

>“Chile is entering a new chapter in its cannabis policy. Lawmakers have introduced a comprehensive bill to regulate adult-use cannabis, advocacy groups are rallying behind it and one of the country’s top presidential candidates has pledged to push for legalization if elected.” stated [*Benzinga*](https://www.benzinga.com/news/legal/25/04/44743798/chile-moves-to-legalize-adult-use-cannabis-with-backing-from-presidential-candidate) in its original coverage.

>“The bill outlines several major changes: adults would be allowed to cultivate up to six flowering plants, store up to 800 grams annually and carry up to 40 grams in public. Consumption would remain restricted to private spaces; public use—including in schools, transport or around minors—would be prohibited. Cultivation collectives of up to 500 members would be legal as long as distribution is limited to members and not commercialized.” the outlet also reported.

>Cannabis legalization models differ across the globe, with no two jurisdictions having the exact same legalization model. Canada has the most robust adult-use commerce system, with sales permitted nationwide, including sales to non-residents. Uruguay also permits adult-use sales, yet they are limited to residents only.

>What is being proposed in Chile is more akin to legalization models in Germany and Malta, both of which permit home cultivation, personal possession, and cultivation associations. However, the cultivation and possession limits being proposed in Chile are considerably greater than what is currently permitted in Germany and Malta.",31,2025-04-12 17:12:36,BubsyFanboy

worldnews,1jpbeq3,mky425p,"Snippet from this news article: “Russian forces’ advance into Ukraine has slowed significantly in the past few months, with Moscow seizing just 133 square kilometers in March, the lowest monthly total since June 2024, battlefield monitoring group DeepState reported on April 1.

The pace of Russia’s offensive had steadily increased since July, peaking in November when Russian troops captured 725 square kilometers, overrunning a badly overstretched Ukrainian defense in several areas, especially in the south of Donetsk Oblast.

Gains have consistently declined since the beginning of winter, with the Russian army seizing 401 square kilometers in December, 321 in January, and 189 in February.

This relative stabilization of the front line was achieved thanks to the winter conditions, effective work of Ukrainian drone units, and a temporary exhaustion of Russian offensive potential.

Russian forces continue offensive operations, particularly around the city of Pokrovsk in in Donetsk Oblast, where fighting intensified at the end of March.

Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on March 31 that Russian forces are “stalling” and failing to advance in the area. Pokrovsk, located about 70 kilometers northwest of Donetsk, remains a major flashpoint.

While Russia’s advances in Ukraine have slowed, its forces have nearly reversed Ukraine’s territorial gains in Russia’s Kursk Oblast. Ukraine controlled 407 square kilometers there in early March but held just 70 square kilometers by month’s end, DeepState reported.

Ukraine had initially seized 1,300 square kilometers of Russian territory before Moscow, reinforced by North Korean units, launched a counteroffensive. Since launching operations in Kursk Oblast, Russian forces have suffered over 55,000 casualties, Syrskyi said on March 27.

DeepState warned that Russian forces previously engaged in Kursk may now be redeployed elsewhere, posing additional threats along the front line.",35,2025-04-02 00:26:08,AndroidOne1

>“Given Russia’s ongoing aggression against Ukraine, we must concede that peace in Ukraine appears to be out of reach in the immediate future…Russia needs to understand that Ukraine is able to go on fighting, and we will support it,” Boris Pistorius said. 

>Pistorius made the comments at a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group on Friday, which he co-chaired alongside his British counterpart, John Healey. 

>The Ukraine Defense Contact Group is a forum bringing together NATO members and other countries that have supported Ukraine – such as Australia and Japan – set up by the Biden administration during the first weeks of Russia’s invasion of its neighbor. 

>Since President Donald Trump returned to power in January, however, the U.S. has stepped back from the role of chairing the group, with the U.K. now taking a more prominent leadership role. 

>American Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was a notable physical absence at Friday’s meeting — which was attended by defense ministers from around 50 countries — choosing to instead make an appearance virtually.

>Pistorius insisted Hegseth’s choice not to attend in person was due to scheduling reasons, adding: “The most important fact was that he took part.” 

>At the same time, the minister acknowledged that it was not clear how U.S. support for Ukraine would develop in the future. 

>Trump has made finding a resolution to the war in Ukraine a priority of his administration, saying he wants to be remembered as a peacemaker.

>However, many European powers are concerned Trump could be turning his back on Europe for a bargain that makes significant concessions to Putin.

>On the same day of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting, Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, arrived in Moscow for reported talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

>NATO allies, meanwhile, pledged over €21 billion in new military aid to Kyiv on Friday, with Berlin set to provide four IRIS-T air defense systems with 300 missiles.

>The U.K. announced that, alongside Norway, it would provide money for radar systems, anti-tank mines and hundreds of thousands of drones.

>Friday’s meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group also comes a day after a gathering of the so-called “coalition of the willing,” a group of countries led by France and the U.K. that are willing to send peacekeeping forces into Ukraine following a future ceasefire agreement. 

>The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said consensus on how such a peacekeeping mission would work has not yet been reached, and that “discussions are still ongoing,” British newspaper The Telegraph reported. ",14,2025-04-12 12:55:49,BubsyFanboy

> US and western intelligence officials do not believe that Russia is interested in negotiating a ceasefire deal with Ukraine in good faith, CNN has reported. Moscow still believes it can sustain its war effort and outlast Ukraine on the battlefield.

>A senior NATO official reiterated that on Thursday, saying that “Russia still believes that time mostly is on its side.”

>“We have had questions for a long time about whether Putin intends to negotiate in good faith,” the official said. Russia is “willing to continue those talks [about mending ties with the US] at the same time that it is delaying and stalling and saying that they can’t accept the US proposals right now, on the actual ceasefire. I think all of that supports the idea that Russia’s goals haven’t changed at all—that right now, what it is trying to do is probably stall for time, make less concessions on the war, and try to instead make progress on sanctions, on Russia’s place in the international community.”

And keeping Boris Pistorius as the Defense Minister in the new government is indicative that some brainpower is being applied to governance, not just fear.  Boris inspires confidence among allies.  As reluctant as it has been in the past Germany is a beacon of the west and the tentatively of prior government leadership was a real drag.

I just hope NATO sans America really pushes hard in the next few months and completely takes over leadership and supply for Ukraine in every possible context.  I wish America was with you and many if not most of us individually are totally in support of Ukraine and its allies, but we are currently ruled by clowns and our electoral system has declined to the point that the tail wags the dog.  While we sort this out sadly we are unreliable.  I know American aid is continuing to Ukraine but the issue is the reliability, and Ukraine needs reliability.  That sends a message to the enemy Russia.

Everything I have read seems to indicate that this year is a transformative year for Ukraine.  The latter part of 2023 and 2024 were focused on the nascent stages of building/rebuilding military industrial capacity.  Very late 2024 and 2025 is the period much of it accelerates to full capacity and builds upon itself.  Resulting in the EU and Ukraine substantially obtaining independence of America.  Not 100% but vastly improved vs 2022/2023.

Trump desires this break from Ukraine but for the wrong reasons.  However, he is willing to rape Ukraine prior to it achieving that independence and he is pushing hard knowing the day is coming when he will be an afterthought and just a very distasteful remembrance of the past.

There is a reason these sites exist on the dark web and not the open net. It makes it very hard to find the operating location of the server and the location of the users.

Just look at motor cars and Japan, then Korea. First you make cheap as shit cars, later you make competitive middle ground cars and eventually you try to compete in the luxury market where the margins are the biggest. 

China was always going to win the budget electric car race because it has total vertical integration in China. Batteries were already the cheapest to make in China and most of the cost of an electric car is the battery. All the materials, chips and rare earths needed to build these can be sourced locally. They have a massive cheap workforce and china has about 15% of total Lithium Deposits on Earth. 

Whats happening with Electric cars right now is the same things that happened with Solar in Europe. Europe pioneered most of the tech, wanted to sell itself to the world like most of the German Tech, as a luxury good, but simply never had a chance in hell to compete with a vertically integrated materials cheap labor China.

worldnews,1k0fzoq,mnezrt4,"People keep saying this ruling specifically extends protections to trans people from discrimination as if the ruling doesn't void the primary form of discrimination against trans people as no longer discrimination but law. 

This is a horrible precedent for trans people. Believe it or not the vast majority of trans people are not abusing sex based services as some attack on cis people. It simply makes no practical sense to segregate trans people on biological sex for most sex segregation situations and when it is done this way it greatly harms trans people and significantly increases their risks of being victimized, significantly more than cis people ever getting victimized by trans people. 

This kind of mandate basically says that bearded trans men with penises who may have spent most of their lives already as men must be placed with cis women, in jails, locker rooms, bathrooms, womens shelters, etc. Meanwhile transwomen with vaginas must be placed with men in all these same places. Absolutely outing them to literally everyone. But you can't discriminate against them for being outed or forced into these spaces... as if that'll happen. 

Believe it or not not all trans people look like the stereotype you have in your head. Way more of us fly under the radar than you think. More of us every year live longer as our transitioned gender than our gender assigned to our biological sex. 

Without having any nuance to these laws all that is happening is shafting trans people harder, creating more opportunities for discrimination for anyone that 'doesn't look like they belong' in the mandated sexually segregated spaces, raising tension and only 'saving' a tiny tiny portion of people ever victimized by trans people at the cost of all trans people.

>“China’s military has too large of a presence in the western hemisphere,” Hegseth said. “Make no mistake, Beijing is investing and operating in this region for military advantage and unfair economic gain.”

>He called on the region’s governments to work together to deter China and address threats posed by transnational drug cartels and mass immigration.

>Hegseth was speaking a day after meeting Panama’s President José Raúl Mulino and touring the Panama Canal. The two countries agreed to step up security coordination and appeared to say they would work toward a way to pay back fees that U.S. warships pay to pass through the Panama Canal.

>The visit comes amid tensions over U.S. President Donald Trump’s repeated assertions that the U.S. is being overcharged to use the Panama Canal and that China has influence over its operations — allegations that Panama has denied.

worldnews,1jvsz0p,mmf76h8,"Engineering take (although not Civil, but you get around after a while): 

Just looking at the debris, 99% it's because of the large number of massive very heavy ACs and what looks like maybe some generators or power converters on a heavy concrete roof which apparently was damaged in fire some years back, inspections likely rushed or bribed off (because that's how a lot of the Caribbean operates if you have you ever spent any time there) so the nightclub could keep operating without having to do a very expensive roof replacement after the fire. Also, regular structural inspections of concrete roofs with lots of heavy crap on top of them should be followed to the letter, unknown if those requirements even exist in DR though. 

This is all on the owners and the building inspectors: allowing insufficient support for a heavy roof that had tons of heavy crap stacked on top of it and had already been damaged previously, then possibly suspending more stage and lighting crap from the roof on the inside without providing any more shoring, and on top of that having very loud events directly underneath this concrete roof that is of course going to reverberate and resonate with the loud music happening right below it.

I think we have a lot of guilt being the place where Trump's grandfather made his initial fortune.

Starlink has been a hard one for us though, Our local internet is pretty awful and unreliable, and in today's age it's becoming more and more important we have functional internet.
Last year we had a 30 or so hour long telecommunications outage. No internet, no cellphones, etc. It was... honestly pretty amazing, however the banks couldn't operate, lots of businesses couldn't function, and the government couldn't work.

So we had a sudden large push of everyone starting to get starlink. I kinda hated seeing that because of Elon, but this was also before the election in the states and everything that's happened since.

Now a lot of us are really feeling a lot of guilt over supporting Elon as well, So people are beginning to drop starlink \[if they care\]

We've already decided to not get it at my workplace, after planning for a long time to do so.

«On a quiet, remote trail in British Columbia near the Yukon boundary sits a replica wooden facade of the brothel and restaurant Trump’s grandfather built at the turn of the century.

Friedrich Trump called his business in Bennett, a town that sprang up because of the Klondike Gold Rush, the Arctic Restaurant & Hotel.

Parks Canada says the replica at the Chilkoot Trail National Historic Site was constructed in 2017, and the kitchen inside is now exclusively used by government workers. (…)

A 90-year-old Yukoner who wrote a booklet about men who became wealthy off the gold rush, including Friedrich Trump, says the replica should remind President Trump to show gratitude to Canada rather than launching a trade war and annexation bid against it.»",5,2025-04-04 22:05:46,Billy_Ektorp

'**International law prohibits states from intervening in the internal and external affairs of other states, but only if the method of intervention is coercive.** This Article argues that coercion can be understood in two different ways or models. First, as **coercion-as-extortion**, a demand coupled with a threat of harm or the infliction of harm, done to extract some kind of concession from the victim state—in other words, an act targeting the victim state's will or decision-making calculus. Second, as **coercion-as-control**, an action materially depriving the victim state of its ability to control its sovereign choices. This may be done even through acts like cyber operations that the victim state is entirely unaware of. The Article argues that many of the difficulties surrounding the notion of coercion arise as a consequence of failing to distinguish between these two different models.

The article grabbed a random ass douyin post which has 11 likes and 10 comments, proceed to quote a content with supposedly tens of thousands of likes and comment but for some reasons, has no picture or screen shot or link to show for it. Are we really just assume that no one read Chinese these days? Or the claimed video or account no longer exists?

Meanwhile there are [actual videos with hundreds of thousands of views on Bilibili](https://b23.tv/ULlJxnz) with Chinese internet users openly mocking Russian war effort and call those that overtly support Russia as traitors. Then when Trump&Friends bashes Zelensky in White House and US embassy in China shamelessly publish that video, [vast majority](https://imgur.com/a/yarjQZg) of early reply are actively supporting Zelensky and Ukraine while calling Russia the aggressor and those in support of the aggressor shameless. 

It seems like Chinese online space was generally neutral, if not pro-Ukraine by Trump’s presidency. If the media would really like to make a report of increasing Russian-propaganda presence in Chinese internet space, at least grabbed a picture that correctly reflect the claim.

worldnews,1jox8xr,mkv3yav,"> “We will approach these negotiations from a position of strength,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a speech to the European Parliament on Tuesday, the eve of Trump’s big tariff announcement.

> “Europe holds a lot of cards. From trade to technology, to the size of our market. But this strength is also built on our readiness to take firm countermeasures. All instruments are on the table.”

> In targeting U.S. services, Brussels could be thinking of bulge-bracket banks like J.P. Morgan or Bank of America, or tech players like Elon Musk’s social network X, search giant Google, or Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer.

>...

> The EU is a net exporter of automobiles, pharmaceuticals and food to the U.S. But it’s a net importer of services — and that gives it more leverage in a trade dispute. (Taking goods and services together, transatlantic trade is actually broadly in balance. The EU enjoys an overall surplus of just $50 billion, or about 3 percent of the $1.7 trillion in annual transatlantic commerce.)

> “America’s tech giants, financial industry, and pharma companies have deep roots in Europe. Push too far, and Brussels could tighten the screws: digital levies on Silicon Valley, regulatory clamps on Wall Street, or taxes on U.S. pharma exports,” said Tobias Gehrke, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. 

>...

> The thing is, there are only so many goods you can hit when the damage is so big. 

> “If Trump imposes reciprocal tariffs, we are entering a whole new game,” said an EU diplomat, granted anonymity, like others quoted in this story, to speak candidly.

> Depending on Trump’s own playbook, there are two broad ways the Commission could go about hitting services.

> First, by making use of the existing regulations it has built over the last five years, it can tighten rules governing Big Tech; tax major American banks; or slow the issuance of licenses to do business in the EU. 

> “When you see the positioning of the big American tech companies over the last few months, who are all close to Trump, you get the impression that they’re lobbying the White House against Europe. In fact, they’re extremely vulnerable to retaliatory measures,” said Yves Melin, a founding partner at law firm Cassidy Levy Kent. 

> A case in point is the bloc’s Digital Markets Act, which seeks to curb the power of dominant tech players and safeguard competition. The Commission is set to decide as soon as this week whether Apple and Meta are in breach of those rules. 

> But it’s also an area where Brussels will be cautious of fanning the flames. 

> “The problem with the digital part is that the moment the EU does that, the pressure from the U.S on the regulatory framework will even increase,” said Arnoud Willems, partner for international trade at law firm King & Spalding. 

> Taxing financial transactions and digital flows, or making American airlines pay more to land in European airports, are other levers available to the EU, he added.

> The EU could also restrict the access of U.S. companies to public contracts under its new International Procurement Instrument. If Brussels shuts out American energy or consulting firms from EU public contracts, that would hit a major revenue source.

>...

> As a last resort the EU can deploy its trade “bazooka” — the Anti-Coercion Instrument. As the name suggests, it would enable a broad-spectrum response, including targeting services, if Brussels concludes that U.S. actions are excessive.

> “These things are in principle … possible, for example, under the Anti-Coercion Instrument,” said the senior EU official cited above when asked whether the EU would hit trade in services.

> Within six months the Commission could go as far as to pull the plug on Musk’s X; restrict the intellectual property rights of U.S. tech giants; or bar them from investing in the EU.

>;While the EU executive would call the shots on when to use that nuclear option, it would need the support of 15 out of its 27 member countries to decide whether and how to strike. 

> “Many member states don’t want to escalate by triggering an anti-coercion case,” said the EU diplomat quoted above.

> European businesses also worry about going down that route.

> “The problem with all these ideas of leverage is that they are not really leverage,” said Luisa Santos, deputy director general at corporate lobby group BusinessEurope. 

> “Our economies are so intertwined … that even if you impose tariffs or any other measure on the services side, you will be hurting your own interest,” she added. 

> And even as it signals its willingness to escalate, Brussels also hopes to bring Washington to the negotiating table. Trade Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič is hoping his U.S. counterparts can settle on a “term sheet” that sets out a framework for talks — when the next round of tariffs takes effect.

> These could entail lowering duties, investing in American defense firms, boosting purchases of U.S. liquefied natural gas, or softening some regulations.",50,2025-04-01 14:50:08,DifusDofus

worldnews,1k2mwqm,mnwq9t9,">**Four journalists linked to the late Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny were sentenced to spend five years and six months in a penal colony on Tuesday, after they were accused of working for a banned organization run by the Kremlin critic, Russian state media TASS has reported.**

>The reporters – Antonina Favorskaya, Sergei Karelin, Konstantin Gabov and Artem Kriger – have been on trial behind closed doors since October on charges, which they deny, of belonging to an “extremist” group established by Navalny in 2011.

>Prosecutors claimed the four had produced material for the YouTube channel of Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK), according to Reuters, which is prohibited under the country’s “foreign agents law.” Amnesty International has warned that the “repressive” legislation is an “attack on freedom of association” in Russia, where Moscow has increasingly attempted to stifle journalists under censorship laws.

>In February, mourners gathered at Navalny’s graveside in the Russian capital to mark the first anniversary of his death in prison. Dozens of people were detained at memorials, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW) and other rights groups.

>Over his storied political career, Navalny generated some of the largest anti-government demonstrations in recent years, and unfurled corruption at Russia’s highest seat of power, under the FBK.

>Navalny died suddenly at the age of 47 on February 16, 2024, while serving a 19-year sentence on extremism charges he denied. At the time, Russia’s prison service claimed he “felt unwell after a walk.” But Navalny’s wife, Yulia Navalnaya, and former US President Joe Biden have long held Russian President Vladimir Putin responsible for his death. Moscow has rebuffed those allegations.

>Authorities in Russia have since tried to “erase Navalny’s political legacy” through their “extensive arsenal of repressive tools,” according to HRW – which called the arrests on the first anniversary of his death “just the tip of the iceberg in the Kremlin’s continued crackdown on his supporters.”",9,2025-04-19 11:04:17,BubsyFanboy
