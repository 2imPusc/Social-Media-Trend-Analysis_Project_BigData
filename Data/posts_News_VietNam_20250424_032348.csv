VietNam,1jw76v5,Tiếng Việt trong Minecraft Bedrock? / Vietnamese in Minecraft Bedrock?,"Hey everyone!
Chào mọi người!

This might sound a bit quirky, but if you speak Vietnamese, we’d love your help in translating or improving the Vietnamese translations for Minecraft Bedrock Edition!
Nghe có vẻ hơi lạ một chút, nhưng nếu bạn nói tiếng Việt, chúng tôi rất mong bạn giúp dịch hoặc cải thiện bản dịch tiếng Việt cho Minecraft Bedrock Edition!

We’re working on expanding language support—adding new languages like Romanian, Arabic, and Filipino—bringing the total to about 110! Right now, we’re especially focusing on Vietnamese. This is a great opportunity to bring Vietnamese to thousands (or even millions) of players around the world!
Chúng tôi đang mở rộng hỗ trợ ngôn ngữ, thêm các ngôn ngữ mới như tiếng Romania, tiếng Ả Rập, và tiếng Philippines—tổng cộng khoảng 110 ngôn ngữ! Hiện tại, chúng tôi đang đặc biệt tập trung vào tiếng Việt. Đây là một cơ hội tuyệt vời để đưa tiếng Việt đến với hàng ngàn (hoặc hàng triệu) người chơi trên toàn thế giới!

We're also having fun with fun variants like Lolcat, Upside Down English, and Pirate English. While Java Edition supports around 130 languages, Bedrock only has 29. Why? Because Java relies on community translations, while Bedrock hires “professional” companies—who sometimes make some hilarious mistakes (like translating “Cherry Hanging Sign” as “Cherry Execution Sign” in Korean!).
Chúng tôi cũng đang thử nghiệm những biến thể ngôn ngữ vui nhộn như Lolcat, Tiếng Anh lộn ngược, và Tiếng Anh Cướp biển. Trong khi phiên bản Java hỗ trợ khoảng 130 ngôn ngữ, Bedrock chỉ có 29. Tại sao? Vì Java dựa vào cộng đồng để dịch, còn Bedrock thì thuê các công ty “chuyên nghiệp”—mà đôi khi lại mắc những lỗi dịch rất buồn cười (như khi “Biển treo Anh đào” bị dịch thành “Biển xử tử Anh đào” trong tiếng Hàn!).

VietNam,1jpkd4b,I plan to move to Vietnam. Need advice.," 

I’m planning my move to Vietnam. I will fly to HCMC in mid to late August with a 25kg suitcase and a 7kg backpack, this is almost certainly the only concrete confirmed part of the plan. Where things begin differing is later down the line, and I’m just looking for thoughts on what I have below.

 

Plan 1: Settle in HCMC for a few days, put suitcase in storage for 2 weeks and travel north towards Hanoi for the big National Day parade.

After fly back to HCMC, and find an Air BnB for all of September and October, into mid November, and just see how life is like in HCMC for those 2+ months.

Mid-Nov the 90 day Visa I use to enter Vietnam will be near it’s end.  Timing wise though it could be perfect, as in mid-November there’s some things I really want to do in Thailand and Laos for about 2 weeks. So I’d go to the two and fly back into Vietnam late November, now allowed to stay for a further 90 day. This would be when I start to look for work, which I realise is one of the worst times to look but that’s just how it is and I’d hope to find something, but if not I plan to leave for Vietnam with £10,000 in my bank account so this should go a long way before it needs to be replenished (but I do plan on doing so and saving above that, and also truly understand just how quickly money can go especially with a few mishaps, luckily I have that money and stable family situation if anything truly bad happened ), and should allow me to be jobless for at least a couple months from the time of departing. I suppose then I’d just have to address the situation further down the line. For this plan I would probably need to have the documents to get hired notarised whilst I am in Vietnam, but I do have people back home who can assist.

 

 

Plan 2: Arrive in HCMC and start applying for jobs, or have already applied/ hired. Then I would be working in September and October, rather than lounging around HCMC I’d be working and earning, but almost certainly not chilling so much and possibly also being quite stressed. I would have had the documents to get hired notarised in advance in this plan,

However, I would still want to at least fulfil the plan I have in Thailand, at least, so is it common for TEFL teachers in language centres to be able to take time off in Vietnam? The info online is always different. To clarify, I would not care in the slightest if this is unpaid time off – that’s always been fine with me. I also fully intend on being hired by ILA, so anyone with specific ILA related info that’s be perfect. Would it be easy enough to take 4/5 days off to go to Thailand for a big occasion. Then I would plan to come back and work the rest of November, into December and onward.

It may seem drastic not working for 2/3 months maybe more just to be able to go on this trip, but I think I put as much importance in making the most of my time in Asia. As much as I want to advance my career, start earning and saving, I’m also still young and want to experience things, and the money can come back later.

I’m not sure which scenario/plan would be better for me personally trying to settle into a new situation abroad, getting straight to work or allowing time to settle in, even if that is 3-4 months, with periods of travel possible whenever. I also picture this as being a time to get used to life, the heat, make some connections/friends, find places I like, joining clubs, etc.  I tend to think I lean towards this; concerns would be money going out and nothing coming in. This doesn’t seem too big an isusue, like I said earlier I plan to have £10k and also I could technically do bits of online teaching English. The other concern would be having TOO much time on my hands, and a lack of a proper ‘adult’ routine, which can be bad for me.

I also did spend 2 months in Vietnam 7 years ago on an internship and remember getting like really down on the fact that I was sitting in an office doing work (and actually sometimes even worse not doing anything, so literally sat there for no reason), whilst the country I had dreamed of coming to passed me by outside. Maybe it will be good for me to just have a lot of spare time to do all the things I couldn’t do then, and even that I never got to in my recent trip.

Curious to hear some thoughts on the logistics of this, and if anyone has any input or advice.",8,0.83,27,2025-04-02 09:19:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1jpkd4b/i_plan_to_move_to_vietnam_need_advice/,Danbesua

VietNam,1jmsr2w,Huỳnh Tịnh Của: The Pioneer of Vietnamese National Language Journalism,"“Huỳnh Tịnh Của (1834 - 1907) quê quán tỉnh Bà Rịa. Ông thông thạo Hán và Pháp văn. Ông là nhà văn quốc ngữ đầu tiên của báo chí Việt Nam (tờ Gia Định Báo).”

Huỳnh Tịnh Của (1834–1907), born in Ba Ria province, is celebrated as the first Vietnamese journalist to write in the quốc ngữ script. Fluent in Chinese and French, he contributed significantly to both literature and journalism. His work on the Gia Định Báo—Vietnam’s first national-language newspaper—cemented his role as a key figure in the early development of Vietnamese print media.

Beyond journalism, Huỳnh Tịnh Của authored and compiled influential texts, including Chuyện Giải Buồn (Tales to Relieve Sadness) and the landmark Đại Nam Quấc Âm Tự Vị, the first monolingual Vietnamese dictionary. These contributions not only supported the growth of chữ quốc ngữ as a literary medium but also laid the groundwork for future generations of Vietnamese writers.

VietNam,1k527gg,"Tried withdrawing money at Vietcom Bank yesterday. It wouldn't accept my foreign card, but it still took the money from my account","Yesterday when I arrived in Sapa, I tried withdrawing cash at a Vietcom ATM. The first time I tried, I was shown a message that it could not process the transaction. Stupidly, I made a second attempt and again it didn't work. I finally found a BIDV machine close by, tried withdrawing cash there and had no issues. However, after looking at my bank app later that afternoon I noticed that even though the withdrawals didn't work at the Vietcom machine, it still took the amounts from my account.

I called my bank back home to tell them about this and they said that sometimes this happens to people when using foreign ATMs, but that the banks usually reverse the charges and the money returns. I'm just paranoid because I've travelled quite a lot and have never had this happen before (if a machine hasn't accepted my card, it's never taken the money). The guy at my bank also mentioned that because yesterday was a holiday back home (Easter Monday), this might be delaying the charge reversal on my bank's side. But he said that if I don't have my money returned by today, to call them back so they can start an investigation and try to retrieve my funds.

I still don't have my money back this afternoon and now I'm also seeing ATM fees from those attempted withdrawals on my account, which has made me even more upset.

VietNam,1k51qc7,My first time flying VietJet,"So yes I'm one of the unfortunate ones that got to experience this flight

First of, I didn't know about the horrible reputation VJ has. I only wanted to go to Hanoi for a short solo trip so I just picked based on price and timing. It was only 1 - 2 weeks before my trip that I was surfing through reddit that I realised what I've done

On the day of departure, I received an email when I woke up that my flight has been delayed by 1.5hrs. This was, well within my expectations as people have mentioned to always expect delays. At least I'm departing from Singapore and as you all might know, Singapore has one of the best airports in the world so I head there to have lunch and shopped around Jewel Changi. Checking in was fine I guess I just used the machine to print my boarding pass. 

When it was close to the boarding time, the plane is....not even there. I guess they exceeded my negative expectations of them even more so kudos to them. We did end up flying, somewhat. I just took a nap and took off my jacket halfway because the aircon was...not cold? 

Lucky for me immigration clearance was smooth I did not have to experience the nightmare that I read and my hotel pickup driver drove me to my place safely. 

Going back home 1 day before guess what yes I received another email saying my flight home will be delayed for 1.5hrs. Plus points for me tbh because I didn't want to wake up so early anyways they are so kind to inform me 8hrs in advance. 

When I woke up guess what, ANOTHER EMAIL. This airline must love their customers a lot to keep sending them emails so yes it was delayed by another 40min.

When I reached the airport, I'm not sure if it's the thing about VJ or the airport but the queue was so long? It wasn't that long for other airlines but whatever I was there early anyways. I had no check in luggage but the lady wanted to weight my carry on is this normal? Lucky for me I also read about VJ wanting to catch and force people to buy check in so I already preemptively took a lot of my luggage stuff to keep in my personal item bag that my luggage went from 7kg (when I left from Singapore) to 6.5kg even though I did bought extra stuff back. 

Oh and of course at the time of boarding the airplane is...you guessed it, NOT THERE. Somehow by some power of god or something we actually managed to take off on time as per the delayed timing. 

I'm now safely back in Singapore where I easily breezed through the automatic immigration barriers. 

I think I'm already immensely lucky to not be stuck for longer than what I already did and technically I wasn't stuck, I just came to the airport later than scheduled.

Safe to say I'll not fly VJ again",9,0.76,11,2025-04-22 09:00:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1k51qc7/my_first_time_flying_vietjet/,InterestingSwim6701

It's just pissed me off, I always pay on time, early if he asks for it and I've been a great tennant. Is it normal for prices to rise by this much? I'm pretty much stuck because I intend to leave the country soon so finding an apartment on that short of a time frame is difficult and probably not worth the stress of moving. 

He's a pretty terrible landlord anyway so I should of expected it. The money isn't really the problem it's more the fact I feel like I'm being taken advantage of.

Very soon it’ll harm the economy, resulting in a recession in the US. This will be very bad politically, so they will be open to any symbolic deal to show something (otherwise they’ll get wrecked next year). 

Vietnam is in a great position to make some bs deal. There is very little overlap between the production of the two countries and the economics heavily favor a high trade deficit with Vietnam regardless of tariff levels. 

What this means is Vietnam is in the position the to “lower” its tariffs in a largely immaterial way and offer an unenforceable agreements to “buy” US goods. 

My view is worst case it stays around 10-20% and republicans lose the house and senate. Best case is hops gets easier to import and vietnams craft beer seen continues to grow.

VietNam,1jns545,Hoi An to Hue - car or train?,"We’re heading from Hoi An to Hue tomorrow, and had been planning to take the train from Da Nang for the scenery. But last night, the bartender at our hotel urged us to take a car instead. She claimed we’d need to arrive at the station at least an hour early, and that once in Hue, it could take another 30–60 minutes just to get our luggage. That was the first time we’d heard anything like that, and now we’re second-guessing things.

Is it actually that much of a hassle? Or is it just: drive an hour to Da Nang, arrive 20 minutes before, board the train, ride 3 hours, get off with your luggage, and you’re done?

Also wondering if this varies between the Reunification Express and the Heritage train—or if it’s just how things work in general.

We know a private car would be more flexible, but there’s rain in the forecast tomorrow. Is the drive over the Hai Van Pass risky in bad weather?

Would love any firsthand experience. Thanks in advance.",7,1.0,30,2025-03-31 01:36:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1jns545/hoi_an_to_hue_car_or_train/,ImpersonalLubricant
VietNam,1jnbrnh,Ha giang loop,"I just got done solo riding the ha giang loop, and I have seen a lot of differing advice on here so I’m hoping to shed some light on how it was.

I have experience riding motorcycles but I’d say I’m solidly beginner/intermediate. I hadn’t ridden in many years, but was hoping I’d bounce right back into it. The first day was the hardest for me. There was a lot of traffic coming out of ha giang, and a lot of hairpin turns with heavy traffic was daunting. However after awhile it became normal, and I grew more confident. I took it slow around corners and felt perfectly safe. IMO if you go slow enough there’s not much to worry about.

Doing it solo I got passed by a lot of groups on easy-riders. This seems like a good option if you don’t know how to use a motorbike, or have confidence in yourself and skills. However, I saw a lot where there was no back on the bike and people were clutching the back of the seat behind them to stabilize themselves. The groups rode really fast, and I saw injuries of riders afterwards (none bad, mostly foot issues, and I didn’t see any in person). 

A lot of folks were pressured into getting easy riders that do know how to ride to help navigate the police checkpoints. Even if they had valid licenses. This wasn’t my experience. I got my bike from QT motorbike tours, and they checked my license and gave me my bike. It was that simple.

I did get stopped at the first checkpoint. As an American, the IDP is not valid, due to a difference in the date. The idp license does not state this, and I don’t believe this is true for elsewhere in Vietnam (still not 100% sure but when I rented in Sapa it was adequate) I fully believe they stopped me because I was clearly a foreigner (other people went through the checkpoint but I was confused and stopped). The guy really had it out for me, and it was very clear to me it was a complete racket. I got no formal ticket, but a date on a pamphlet and he said I’d be good for the rest of the trip. He tried to get me to go to an atm and leave my passport behind, tried to say he would search me and my bag (not allowed). When I refused he let me go with a 50.00 usd “fine”.

My friends got stopped twice a bit behind me. They had a similar situation but as soon as the one called his Vietnamese wife they let him go. It seemed clear they did not want outsiders to know this is the situation. Their fine amount was also different.

After the first day we did not see anymore checkpoints. It was honestly an incredible trip, and the fuss about the checkpoint was easily wiped away with how amazing everything else was. I wouldn’t let that deter anybody from riding solo. I think it also helped I did have a license I GENUINELY THOUGHT was valid and had backups to my license I hold. From what the locals said it was also a negative that I am a woman. I’m not quite sure why, but that seemed to be the consensus.

The accommodations around the loop were incredible, and getting into town before the easy riders (about 2-4pm each day) made it easy to find good, cheap accommodations with time to explore the town!",6,0.76,4,2025-03-30 12:53:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1jnbrnh/ha_giang_loop/,Pale_Anxiety_635

VietNam,1jj7fq9,Hoàng Việt: A Vietnamese Musical Pioneer,"Hoàng Việt (born Lê Chí Trực, 1928-1967) was a trailblazing Vietnamese composer and one of the country’s most celebrated musical talents. Hailing from Cái Bè District, Tiền Giang Province, he became a towering figure in Vietnamese classical and revolutionary music. Among his best-known compositions is “Nhạc Rừng” (Forest Melody), a poignant piece that captured the spirit of a generation.

Posthumously honored with the Hồ Chí Minh Prize, Vietnam’s highest state award for artists, Hoàng Việt’s work not only elevated the nation’s musical heritage but also inspired countless musicians to follow in his footsteps. His melodies, imbued with both patriotism and artistry, continue to resonate with Vietnamese audiences today.

VietNam,1jy1p1c,Nguyễn Sáng: Vietnam’s Revolutionary Painter,"Vietnamese Text on the Sign:
“Nguyễn Sáng (1923 - 1988) họa sỹ nổi tiếng người Tiền Giang.”

Direct English Translation:
“Nguyễn Sáng (1923–1988) was a famous painter from Tiền Giang.”

Nguyễn Sáng, born in 1923 in Tiền Giang, rose to prominence as one of Vietnam’s most celebrated painters. His work reflected the history and culture of the nation, deeply rooted in the revolutionary struggles of the time. Renowned for his mastery of lacquer and oil painting, he created iconic works like “Party Admission at Điện Biên Phủ,” “The Enemy Burned My Village,” and “Young Girl by the Lotus.” Through these pieces, he captured the resilience and spirit of the Vietnamese people.

Beyond painting, Nguyễn Sáng contributed to Vietnam’s cultural identity by designing the country’s first postage stamps and pioneering a modern approach to traditional art forms. In recognition of his contributions, he was posthumously awarded the Hồ Chí Minh Prize, and several of his works are considered national treasures. His legacy endures not just in museums but in the continuing influence he has on generations of Vietnamese artists.

VietNam,1k5gdta,A fun story about Vietjet,"So since I saw a surge of Vietjet insane delay posts lately, I thought it would be nice to tell you how their terrible delay saved my ass once. 

I ordered an one way from Saigon to Hanoi and it ""supposed"" to take off at 3:30 pm. That means check-in closed at 3:10 pm and I supposed to go from 1:30 pm since from district 7 to Tan San Nhat is about an hour. How stupid I was to took a nap and when I woke up it was 2:30 pm. I quickly packed my things and got on a taxi 10 mins later. Then my data sim card died right afterward and I had to borrow the driver's phone just to get internet access. It was a horrible situation, my parents was gonna kill me if I missed the plane and I was so worried that even the driver was concern. Guess what, Vietjet came down like an angle and sent an email that they would delay the flight by an hour while I was half way to the airport. When I reached the terminal another delay all the way to 4:15. At that point I was happily excepting waiting lmao. I managed to board the plane at 5pm and had to wait an extra half an hour to take off. The end.

  
TLDR: I was surely gonna missed my flight, got into trouble, then VIetjet forced everyone to wait an 2 hours and 30 mins as margin for error and saved my sleepy ass lmao. I gave the taxi driver the biggest tips I have ever gave that day, that man deserves everything I put him through.

The pair was easily deceived, and the ' group ' kept on borrowing money from them, even though what the ' group  ' did was basically: drink, sleep, eat, wake up, drink, sleep, eat, and repeat. From evening to midnight, they drink, sing, and eat. They slept till its afternoon, and then they repeated it all again. Like they don't do anything for a living, and yet the manager pair still kept on letting them borrow money, and I swear, that group ain't gonna return their money. The manager, now broke because they let the ' group ' to borrow all of their savings and need to pay the real owner their rent money, got persuaded by the group and try to borrow from one of my family member , but they declined because if we did agree and let the manager to borrow the money, we are involuntarily helping that trashy group.

VietNam,1jlbct1,Why do Vietnamese have different chess rules than the rest of the world?,"My kids and I play chess. We follow the international rules. Sometimes they play chess at school with their friends. A few years ago my kids told me that the kids at school play with different rules. I haven't bothered learning the Vietnamese rules but my kids have explained a couple of them to me. For example, you don't trap the king (as you do in international rules), you capture it (ie, removing it from the board). You don't say ""check"" when you put the opponent's king into check. If you don't realize you are in check and you try to move another piece (that doesn't block the check), it is a mistake/error and you can only make a couple of such errors without losing the game. Some really weird rules that I figured the school kids made up, because they are kids and kids do weird/dumb things sometimes.

But.... today I learned that there is a teacher at their school who is teaching them all chess. There's a city-wide tournament coming up and this teacher is the official teacher/coach for the school. And he's teaching them these same Vietnamese rules, not the international rules accepted by FIDE. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIDE)

It seems pretty silly to teach the kids a different set of rules. What if they did this with football? It would make Vietnamese players/teams totally unable to compete internationally. Well, that's what they're doing by teaching the kids the wrong chess rules.

VietNam,1k4htrr,"How many days do I need each in Da Nang, Hue and Hoi An (and elsewhere?) with a food focus?","I'm planning a first-ever visit (solo) to Vietnam and looking at central Vietnam for 7-10 days. My main focus is on the food, ""grazing"" as much as I can throughout each day and hopefully filling in the ""in-between"" time with interesting things to do. I like food markets, hanging in coffee shops, observing people, learning about culture/history, etc. Definitely not a beach-dweller. Not big on big crowds and over-tourism, but can tolerate a bit for the sake of good food.

So, given this, how many days/nights would you recommend I spend each in Da Nang (will probably fly in to this airport), Hue and Hoi An? Or maybe you have recommendation of elsewhere to explore in central Vietnam? (I will likely go to Ho Chi Minh City from central VN to spend a couple of days before flying home.)

My sense (maybe wrong) is that Da Nang is the largest with lots of places to eat, but not much else besides the beach? Hoi An looks like an easy day-trip if I don't want to get hotels in all three cities, but despite it's touristic feel, maybe the food warrants additional time? Hue seems the most chill of the three places, so I was considering three nights unless that's too many.

I make rice exclusively on the stove because I have no room for a rice cooker. Whenever I follow the package directions or the mysterious finger method, I always end up with a wet, slimy mess.

I have resorted to treating rice like I do pasta: Boil an excessive amount of salted water, add the rice, let it go until I’ve reached the desired texture, dump the water, then have the stuff sit while excess moisture evaporates. The result is  less than fantastic but it’s the only method that works for me.

VietNam,1jw2j39,Should I Move to Vietnam,"Hello folks,

So I joined Reddit to ask this question. 

I work for a Swiss based consumer goods company in India. I got promoted and now they’re sending me to Vietnam , Ho Chi Minh City in a leadership position. My move date is on 5th of May this year and till now I haven’t been researching much about life as an indian in vietnam.

For a week or so I researched and my research on YouTube, this forum, and forums like trip advisor, travel fish, and VBF left me thinking if I as an indian should move there.

I realized that my country men and women don’t carry a good image in Vietnam, for reasons that I don’t find implausible, but nevertheless I am quite worried about unnecessary intense micro aggressions , starkly askances and most importantly social ostracization. There a ton of videos on YouTube that I saw recently where many Indians reported rude and disrespectful behavior from locals. I am not doing any blame or shame here, I am just sharing what I found.

A good friend of mine, who is an Indian, is a CFO for Unilever Vietnam, he too asked me to think twice before moving to Vietnam. His case is a bit different though, he lives in Singapore for 20 odd days in Vietnam and the rest of the 10 days in Vietnam.

Now the thing is that I wouldn’t have to navigate when I move into the city. My housing, car and household help everything will be ready before I land. So I am sure I would not be facing any landlord denying me housing because I am form india. 

But I am quite worried what would life be if I go out for a coffee or for a dinner in a nice restaurant. There are tons of YouTube videos from indian travelers stating that they’re not allowed to enter and even chased away.

I know many of you will say do not come and will unleash a string of vilification because of where I am from. But if you give it a thought, and if you were at my place, what would you have done? Also what do the locals in this forum recommend. 

Thanks in advance for any constructive criticism and practical feedback.",2,0.52,52,2025-04-10 16:46:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1jw2j39/should_i_move_to_vietnam/,pitsnvulva69

VietNam,1jtbein,1940: When a Flag of Red and Gold First Flew for Vietnam,"""Nam Kỳ Khởi Nghĩa. Năm 1940, nhân dân miền Nam nổi dậy chống Pháp, đây là cuộc diễn tập cho toàn quốc kháng chiến 1945. Lần đầu tiên cờ đỏ sao vàng tung bay tại Đình Long Hưng huyện Châu Thành - Tiền Giang.""

In 1940, the Nam Kỳ Khởi Nghĩa (Southern Uprising) marked a pivotal moment in Vietnam’s struggle against French colonial rule, foreshadowing the nationwide resistance of 1945. The people of southern Vietnam revolted, and for the first time, the red flag with a yellow star flew defiantly at Đình Long Hưng in Châu Thành district, Tiền Giang province.

This flag, designed to symbolize the unity and revolutionary spirit of the Vietnamese people, became an emblem of resistance against colonial oppression. Although the uprising was ultimately suppressed, the image of the red flag with a yellow star flying high left an indelible mark, galvanizing the movement for independence.

I will be spending a month in Vietnam, mainly Da Nang, and I wanted to get a head-start when it comes to attire etiquette 

Now, I know I'm a Tay, so these dont apply to me I guess as expectations should be low but I enjoy not sticking out by not being overdressed nor underdressed.  I tend to comply with etiquette adopted by white collar professionals. So I had couple questions!

1) Sleeveless tops - do folk wear them for casual evenings and/or running errands? 
2) Do folk wear pants and closed shoes for decent evenings or do non-sports shorts and sandals suffice?
3) night clubs and evening entertainment - are non-casual shorts OK? 

Any and all suggestions regarding pants, shoes, shorts etc are welcome

Lãnh Bình Cẩn, born Nguyễn Văn Cẩn in Mỹ Lợi village, Kiến Đăng district, was a key figure in southern Vietnam’s resistance against the French from 1861 to 1866. As a skilled military leader, he achieved numerous victories, often alongside other historical figures such as Nguyễn Hữu Huân.

Renowned for his organizational abilities and dedication to the cause, Lãnh Bình Cẩn played a crucial role in keeping the resistance alive, inspiring the local population with his unyielding spirit. After his passing in 1902, his legacy remains a testament to the resilience and patriotism of those who fought to defend their homeland.

VietNam,1jj58pf,Document Authentification- Please Help!,"Hello everyone. Some backstory:
My uncle passed away while working abroad in Vietnam. He was a United States citizen that was employed by Vinfast as an electrical powertrain engineer. His payroll was deposited into an HSBC account, which I have personally confirmed with the employer. Since his passing, I have been named as his estate's Personal Representative, which means that I am tasked with recovering any accounts owned by my uncle. From everything I have learned thus far, it seems that getting his money out of Vietnam will be a monumental feat. 
HSBC has sent over a list of documents that need to be ""Certified True Copies"" (both of our passports and ID's), and ""Certified and Legalized"" copies of the will/trust, my birth certificate, and my Letter of Authority from the local probate courts. They are then asking for ""Legal Opinion"" on all of the documents. I have researched the heck out of the authentification process, which is laborious and expensive. I can't figure out how to ""certify"" a copy of a passport, because the US State Dept won't certify passport photocopies. Is an affidavit sufficient in this case? At what point does translation take place....after the Vietnemese Embassy? Before? And who is the authority on providing a ""legal opinion""? Are there LEGIT companies that specialize in this process, as opposed to me doing this all by myself and potentially screwing it up?
In addition, I have been told that even IF I can present all of the correctly authenticated documents, I will still have a hard time getting the money out of the country. Are wire transfers not a thing internationally from Vietnam? 
Some other notes: Yes, there is a substantial amount of money to make this worth it. On principal alone, I cannot let this go. He earned that money, and paid the crazy tax rates already. Yes, I have been in touch with his employer. They were extremely helpful and supportive from the beginning, however, communication has significantly dropped off. I'm hopeful (or naive) to think that they're trying to work on a solution to help me, and perhaps I'm just being impatient. 
I'm extraordinarily persistent. I go above and beyond to get things done and help others. I'm hoping that someone can offer some insight, and thanks for reading if you got this far.",3,1.0,4,2025-03-24 23:22:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1jj58pf/document_authentification_please_help/,DrFrankenvine

VietNam,1k531zf,Cultural question: Going to temples on Lunar NY,"Hi!

Please can a Vietnamese person who has lived or is living in Vietnam answer my question: Is it normal/common for Vietnamese people to go to temples at exactly or around 12 am on Lunar New Year to pray and mark the new year?

Thanks.

\[Edit: Sorry I think I have been a bit mistaken with my initial question, I would like to expand the question to do they visit temples during any time of the night leading up to the actual Lunar New Year's Day.\]",2,1.0,24,2025-04-22 10:33:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1k531zf/cultural_question_going_to_temples_on_lunar_ny/,tomatotallynotafruit

VietNam,1k4xgyi,TRC without work permit,"Hello! Sorry for the long post (and if I ever sound dumb). 

I want to stay in Vietnam for at least a year or a half and obtain TRC. I searched and there are two possible ways -- student path and business path. I am trying to weigh down which is best and possible.

Business is a bit vague on my end because I don't want to run this and it may be costly. Student's path is better (?) if I can enroll in a 6 months to a year course but I'm not sure if that would be allowed. All the data I know is from the internet so I want to learn from someone who actually did business or who enrolled to get TRC.

what's the process and estimated cost? 

thank you for helping.

VietNam,1k4wnat,Need to travel from Vietnam to Japan last minute. Any advices?," I hope this post doesn’t get taken down given the nature of it, but here’s the story. I’m currently living in Vietnam during a short stay because work demanded it. Long story short, I’m from Colombia and I think I will eventually move here buuuut my residence permit has not been approved yet. However, my family wants to make a brief vacation trip from Colombia, visit Vietnam and then go to Japan, but from what I’ve heard, you can only get it if you have a work permit or you are a long stay resident. Do you guys have any tips on how could I get the permit to enter the country from here? Maybe sending my passport home or going to another country?

All tips are greatly appreciated :)",2,1.0,10,2025-04-22 03:25:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1k4wnat/need_to_travel_from_vietnam_to_japan_last_minute/,Mr_Sigmundo
VietNam,1k4wj1m,Long Xuyen City: sourcing American size scooter helmet,"Spending at least a year here in Long Xuyen City, teaching English. I quickly found out the city is immersed in scooter culture. My challenge is that many of the Grab drivers helmets do not fit me and some even appeared with broken straps. Just trying to stay alive here. Does anyone know of a resource that would stock larger size helmets for my ginormous Texan head.
