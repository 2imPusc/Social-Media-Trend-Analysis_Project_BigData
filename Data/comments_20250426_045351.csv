mkdhua4,1jmgxy4,reddit,"TL;DR: I am *shook* by the immediate action my local LA Fitness took after word vomiting at the Personal Training Manager on how disappointed I am about this location. Moral of the story: Don't be afraid to speak up about broken equipment - even little annoyances that aren't that big of a deal.



Apparently my membership was randomly ""upgraded"" and I was eligible for a free assessment (aka sales tactic to get me to sign up for PT). I turned it down, and the PT Manager responded with something to the effect of, ""Okay, we just want to make sure you're getting the most out of your workouts and are happy with the gym."" I responded, ""Oh I'm definitely not happy with this gym."" I proceeded to share how I feel like this location is run down and not being kept up very well (there are ""Scheduled for Service"" signs on damn near everything for weeks at a time, sometimes longer) and that I've been considering going to the LAF 5 miles away.  

I asked if the staff make a point to periodically check all the machines to ensure they're in working order. He said they only fix machines when a member reports it. This makes sense because the damn 5 lb. add-on at the lat pulldown machine has needed lubricant for several months and causes major drag if you use it. Nobody's going to take the time to say anything when they can just go grab a 5 lb. plate and carry on with their workout.

After sharing specific examples of broken things at the gym, I apologized for ranting as that was not my intention. He thanked me for the feedback and said he'd share it with the Ops Mgr. I didn't believe him given this gym's track record and shitty online reviews, but it felt good to get that stuff of my chest.

**Literally the very next day,** I noticed three non-LAF people with notepads inspecting every single piece of equipment. Within 72 hours, all the broken paper towel dispensers were fixed. By the end of the week, I saw actual maintenance folks working on the machines 🤯 

I kinda want to make some protein cookies or something for the PT Manager lol. That was some really amazing follow-through!",2025-03-29 16:12:55,131,squogg,fitness
mkcxzmk,1jmgxy4,reddit,"Went to grab a towel and sanitizing spray at the same time as an elderly man; made eye contact, smiled, gave a polite hello as one does. I go to grab one of the spray bottles and he gives me a stern look and says:

“That’ll be 25 cents.”

Playing along with his game, i tell him forlornly, “Shoot, I don’t have any change. Do you take Venmo?”

He raises an eyebrow and says, “I take credit card!” Then immediately starts cracking up like it’s the joke of the century. I start laughing too and tell him he’s got a great business model, then he gives me a big smile and tells me to have a wonderful day.

mkdl2zr,1jmgxy4,reddit,"A couple of months ago, I posted here about doing box jumps at the gym. At the time, I was doing 30 inch jumps, and stacked the boxes for a 36 inch jump. Although it was only a six inch difference, the 36 inch box height looked shockingly high and intimidating compared to the 30 inch box height, and I promptly restacked the boxes to 30 inches.

A redditor here, u/[Icy-Emu-2003](https://www.reddit.com/user/Icy-Emu-2003/), challenged me to try it, just one jump at 36 inches. I promised that I would work on it.

Two months later, I am happy to report that I did it! This week, I was feeling particularly good after doing my box jump sets and decided to go for it. To my surprise, I did it. I felt as if a mental barrier was lifted and I did it two more times.

A couple of days later in the week, I was back in the gym for leg day, and tried it again. The mental barrier now lifted, I did it again five times. Some guy who was working out in the same area, gave me a thumbs up.",2025-03-29 16:30:37,49,cyclingthroughlife,fitness

mm6xx1b,1jv19bp,reddit,"Had a spotter that was way too eager on the bench.

Asked a random for a spot. I tell them:

* I'm planning 3 reps, the last one might be tight.
* I'll unrack it
* you only need to help if I ask for it

Basically it's so I can push to failure - and it's not like I expect catastrophic failure, just may not be able to get the last rep and need help racking.

Well as soon as I get into position their hands are on the bar.

""No, that's ok, I'll unrack it"". 

So their hands leave for a moment. After I unrack it, and start bringing it down for the first rep, their hands are back on the bar. As I start pushing they're even pulling up. 

""No, that's ok, you don't need to help yet"". 

Hands off the bar again. Second rep is on its way up and they grab again and start helping. 

""It's ok I've got it"". 

Hands are back off again. By this point I'm worried about the third rep because it's feels like I'm holding a conversation while pushing for a 3 that I was worried about in the first place, and yea I didn't get the third rep. I think I'd have had a better chance at it with no spotter to be honest.

I don't know if there's a better way to communicate with a random spotter how to go about it. Telling them the number I'm going for feels like it should prompt them about when to expect failure. Saying I'll unrack it should make that part clear. Saying I'll ask for help seems straightforward as well. But often times I find spotters are really hands-on when to my mind it's basically ""don't let me die under this bar"".

mlkns9w,1jrxsxn,reddit,"A month ago I've started using the seated chest press machine in the gym. I was enjoying it especially because it's one of those where you just move the pin to change weights.

Two weeks ago I'm thinking ""are these kind of machines that safe? what if this one breaks during a rep, would I get injured?"". This one wasn't giving me confidence, it wasn't feeling solid, and it's probably pretty old if I had to guess. Anyways, last week I notice it actually broke. I was pretty disappointed, but at the same time I'm glad it wasn't during one of my sets. Not sure if I will use it again once they fix it though.

Similar thing today with one of the cables someone was working on, it dropped during the guy's set. Not sure if he put the safety on or not, but still, you could tell it wasn't a pleasant experience.

Oh, and I remembered, ~two weeks ago, this lat pulldown machine I was using also ""detached"" when I wanted to start a heavy set on it. It scared me a bit so I left and did a different back exercise. Again, a machine which feels old and fragile. And I hate using the cables for pulldowns because they're always occupied and the handles there are hard to change, but I'm not using that machine anymore.

All in all, it starts becoming a fear of mine when using (some of the) machines or cables, that they will break mid-set and I'll get injured because of it, who knows how bad. I'm imagining the ""surprise"" factor can lead to a serious injury.

And yeah, I know what you're thinking, that the gym shouldn't keep old/fragile machines in there, but that's out of my control (besides filing a complaint, but I can't be arsed and I have no ""proof"" of how old stuff is).",2025-04-05 17:56:46,6,thisisnotdiretide,fitness

Last week, I managed 10x160lbs and two weeks ago 8x170lbs. I’ve been working out for 14 months. All other lifts are strong, either approaching “intermediate” or surpassing it. 

After I gave up yesterday, I did ATG at 155lbs and had to bail on my first rep. I finished my entire workout, super fatigued, and then tried my shot with the SSB for heavy singles. I got up to 210lbs, which is 20lbs higher than my heaviest back squat. I didn’t push myself further.

I had been doing back squats as my main lift on Tuesdays and SSB squats on Fridays for low-weight 5x10. I’m thinking to change my routine so that SSB is my main squat.

I think a large part of my problem with back squats is fear around losing control of the bar. SSB eliminated the fear and also let me focus on the lift itself instead of grip.

I was super happy with this lift, so I decided to post in the strength training subreddit. It got enough engagement for it to appear to the general population/people who have never seen a good morning.

I’m walking by the showers to get to the hot tub, and I hear someone talking in the shower. Okay, no big deal they could be talking to someone in the next shower stall right? I didn’t think anything of it. 

I get out to rinse off before sauna and turns out, she’s on a full on PHONE CALL in the shower. She’s being super loud, obnoxious.

One of the staff members calls out “if you’re on the phone in there please get off your phone” since well, you can’t peek in the shower you know.

Did she get off her phone call? Nope. In fact she got more loud and more obnoxious. Cursing out the staff member, being incredibly rude and nasty. 

Then, comes in the same staff member and a female higher up as I’m in the women’s locker room. They both ask her to please finish up her shower because she is being asked to leave. 

She wouldn’t budge. The obnoxious woman argued with them, and continued this way for another half hour, on the phone call and taking a shower. I only know because I take breaks during sauna with cold showers. 

Then as I was finishing up, I saw the obnoxious woman in question -
walking through the locker room, semi clothed, talking shit and being incredibly negative. The first staff member and someone else came by to escort her out of the building. After that I don’t know what happened as I was leaving.

mmsze4j,1jxazfq,reddit,"Here to vent and also ask for advice. Are there any gym owners and/or managers reading this? Here's what happened:

I'm a member of a HIIT/strength class-based gym in which boxing is always one component. The gym provides gloves for a fee, or you can bring your own. I don't use my gloves anywhere else, so I like to leave mine in the car when I'm not at the gym to make things simpler. The other day I couldn't find them ANYWHERE. I petsit, so I thought perhaps I accidentally brought them into one of the houses I was at. I texted my most recent clients, and tried to think back to when I last saw them. This process took a couple days. Since I had no luck there, I reached out to the gym. I told them I had thought they were elsewhere but determined that I must have left them at the gym and it was weird I couldn't find them. (I had left them behind one time before and found them next class no problem - I always feel a bit dumb and scatterbrained after my workouts, as though all my energy is supporting my muscles and not my brain. Not sure if this is common, or just a me thing.) They pointed out that the first of the month had just rolled around, and they donate everything left behind on the 1st! Well, after going back through my booked class history, I determined the last time I had used my gloves was the 31st. :/ So, I left my gloves at the gym and within 12 hours the gym had donated my gloves. I was incredibly frustrated that they wouldn't even give me a full day to claim my property. I suggested they perhaps implement a new system, because it seemed like a system that threw people's stuff out in less than a day was kind of a shitty one. I was surprised when their response was really un-empathetic. It boiled down to ""yeah that sucks"" and ""well there are signs everywhere"" and they really didn't seem to register the fact that the signs don't matter because I didn't realize I left my gloves there until well after they had been donated! Look, I get it. It was my fault I left them behind, not their liability, blah blah blah. But I wouldn't be frustrated at them if another member had taken them or if they at least expressed some empathy. 

tl;dr: Left my gloves behind on the evening of the 31st at my gym, they had been donated to goodwill by the 1st. Gym expresses no remorse. 

Question: For all gym owners and managers: how does your lost and found work? Is there a ""system""? Does it get shoved in a box and never seen again? are things placed on a shelf so everyone can see them? Do you donate every month? six months? Do you date things at all? Would love to know if anyone has a setup that works really well to A) not be hugely burdensome on gym staff, and B) not piss off members by getting rid of their things all the time. I'd like to provide my gym with some concrete suggestions so this doesn't happen again.

  
Question 2: If you were the owner in this case, would you offer me anything? I was sort of expecting them to do SOMETHING nice as a gesture, like free rentals for a certain period, or a discount on new gloves (they do sell some), or a discount off next month's membership. But I don't know what might be typical in this case.

Sorry for the wall of text! I am just frustrated and in a mood at the moment, because I have lost a number of items over the past couple of weeks and it just eats up so much time to try to figure out where things have gone!",2025-04-12 22:19:48,4,keenkidkenner,fitness

I (34F) am very fit - I have visible muscle and lift heavy. A guy who works in memberships came over to me as I was warming up in the squat rack. He asked what I was training and we started talking. I told him I have a trainer and he goes “well, she clearly doesn’t know what she’s doing. I see how you workout and you’re all over the place.” Okay, rude - moving on. He continues to go on about how shitty my trainer is and that I need to train with him. I tell him no, he keeps begging and trash talking my coach. Finally, he’s like “how about we split 50/50, she gets you half the month, I get you the other half.” NO! I finally told him that I will use her until the day I die and he backs off a little. 

He asks if he can show me something…sure? He starts unracking my squat rack which already had 175lbs on it! While he’s showing me this exercise, he asks about my nutrition and I tell him my trainer just put me at 2500 calories. He goes, “bullshit, you need more. You need 2800 because you need to put on size.” He then proceeds to imply multiple times that my butt is flat and that I can only grow my glutes if I use him. He also tells me I need to see a chiropractor because I have an anterior pelvic tilt. He was with me for 30min and the whole entire time he was criticizing me and my trainer. 

He eventually asks what protein powder I use and I tell him. He googles my protein and goes “your protein is shit! That’s why you’re losing weight and not building any muscle. You need to buy the protein from here.” I’m furious at this point and he goes on to give me a backhanded compliment saying “you’re pretty fit.” Excuse me? I’m one of the strongest women in this gym. 

He was constantly attacking me, putting me down and criticizing my body. I almost left the gym in tears, I was so upset. And the level of detail he had about my training means that he is watching me closely. The gym is my happy place and now I feel uncomfortable and unsafe.

And the kicker, the first time I ever talked to him he asked me if I competed in bodybuilding. So clearly my training is working!!

End rant.

Edit: Thank you all for the kind words. I’m thankful for the reassurance that I’m not overreacting.

I ended up having some strangers call 911 because my hands went stiff and numb. A few minutes later it passed. The next day I felt fine and had a great work out, the day after it happened again when I got home from the gym. I took 2 days off from the gym and felt good yesterday, but was feeling weak and getting light headed and tingly when I was lifting today. It's really frustrating for me to have to cut my work out short but better than causing something worse. 

I don't really know why this is happening and I'm not pushing myself in some extreme way. When I went to the doctor I was deficient in vitamin D.

ml2l2q6,1jpk4bl,reddit,"I had a gynaecologist appointment today. Apparently my ovaries thought my life was going a bit too smoothly and gifted me with a haemorrhagic ovarian cyst. Fan-fucking-tastic. Naturally, I coped with this by going to the gym and attempting to (peacefully) outlift my existential rage.

Enter Dumb and Dumber. These two clowns were slamming their plate-loaded machines so hard that the entire gym floor was vibrating like a dodgy earthquake simulator. Every. Single. Rep. For half an hour straight. Right beside me. And then, just when I thought their reign of idiocy was over, they pranced off like majestic, clueless gazelles—without cleaning up their weights. Not just that, but they left two plates on one side, one on the other (I don’t know what kind of asymmetrical chaos ritual that was), and scattered several more around the machine like they were laying down landmines of inconvenience. There was even a gym employee following behind them, silently racking their weights like a janitor after a rock concert. 

So I, weighing in at around 1/3 of what they were lifting for reps, fuelled by the white-hot rage of a woman scorned by her own reproductive system, stalked after them and asked them if they intended to clean up their disaster zone. I reminded them what basic gym etiquette is. They were stammering and hanging their heads by the end of it like chastised toddlers. FFS. Big enough to lift a small car but not a single brain cell.

I am a sociable person just not early in the morning.

I get up in the morning and I am on a tight schedule to get to the gym and workout because I got to get home to take care of my dog's needs before I have to get ready for work.  I don't drag myself out of bed at 4:30 in the morning every day just to socialize at the gym and it's driving me crazy.  I see the same people there every morning.  They have the same mindset as I do, we exchange our hellos, may make a tiny bit of small talk, then we go about our workouts.  They fucking get it!

Lately this one guy that has been working out at the same time as I do for months decided to start talking to me all of the sudden and I fucking hate it....One reason is he will talk to me for over 20 mins or so and it puts me in a bind where I am having to make up for the 20 mins, I missed because of him talking and having to cram everything into the last half of my workout.  He also tends to talk to me on the days I show up late and barely have 30 mins of workout time......

It's getting to a point I don't even want to get out of my car when I see his car there and I hate feeling like I can't work out peacefully.  I am too nice to be mean to someone especially since he has been nothing but, nice to me he just talks to much.  I am also socially awkward since it's so early in the morning my body is still waking up and doesn't know how to function.

ml0wdtz,1jpk4bl,reddit,"Lifting heavy is not dangerous.  Lifting like an idiot is what is dangerous.

Over the course of this rant, I intend to elucidate the facts of a commonly misunderstood topic.

So there I was squatting at around 85% 1RM.  I am hitting doubles on my way to an AMRAP.  The first set, second rep, I just drop my hips in the bottom, losing all tension.  Upon attempting to complete the rep I hyperextend my lower back to get my hips out from underneath me, but doing this at the bottom pitches me forward and I enter the good morning position out of the hole.  Snap, crackle, and pop all join the party, and I have blown out my lower back.  I can normally good morning my way out, but not today.  I proceed to perform squats and RDLs with an empty bar, trying to mitigate the lock-up that is coming.  Cursing myself for getting so sloppy.

Smash cut to the office.  Coworker sees me limping along as asks what happened.  Explained I got sloppy and I got caught.  He responds that this is why he refuses to lift heavy.  I try to explain you should not use a person with a bad back who can fully explain their mistake as a reason to be afraid.  In the end, it is just not really necessary for his goals to lift heavy, and that is fine.  But I was frustrated to have contributed to the myth that weightlifting is ""dangerous.""  Again, it is mostly dangerous when you are dumb, which I was and probably still am.

Furthermore, an injury is not the end of the world.  Learn how to assess yourself and figure out a plan.  Having a bad back, I have been here before.  The next day back in the gym, introducing the load carefully with moderate weight. Just feeling things out and getting an assessment.  In my experience, movement is medicine when you are locked up.  Today is day two, and things feel pretty solid.  Hit the same squat for a single, pulled 88% of my estimated 1RM deadlift.  Both felt solid.  Sometimes, it takes a few weeks, sometimes a few days.  That being said, I will likely re-injure myself sneezing or picking up a sock.

I ended up breaking my foot in China that took forever to heal, then my other foot back in Philly, and I stopped training, got depressed, started drinking more, got chubby, you know the drill.

When it's about my technique or form, cool. But when it's to suggest an alternative exercise, it's getting a bit annoying.

I'm currently on a cut, ended up at 21% body fat at the end of my bulk, which is pretty normal for my body. I managed to reach 17% by eating literally nothing but protein shakers and lean meat for a total of about 1000 calories every day. I'm currently hitting a hard plateau and feeling really discouraged, I've started upping to 1400-1500 calories per day which, for pretty much anyone, is a normal if low amount of calories, and immediately gained back 1% body fat.

I'm currently at 81kg for roughly 182-183cm I go to the gym pretty much everyday, it's not like I have a horrible physique, I'm considered pretty muscular by people around me but I just can't get lean no matter what I do. I have a bad history of anorexia that ended up with me at 48kg 2 years ago, I'd rather not starve myself again but it feels like the only option is to drink nothing but protein shakers and stop the hunger with zero sugar drinks.

I also have a pretty bad fat repartition that gives me small man boobs even when I was at a fairly low body fat, I basically have the body fat repartition of a woman, do you think this could be a hormonal problem ?

So I’ve been in the gym for ~20 years now. I know and practice gym etiquette and am very fluent with the weights and machines and how to improvise a killer workout when it’s busy. 

My rant is to do with women being oddly competitive with me during my workout for no reason. 

There will be a ton of open space and they choose to workout right where it blocks my view of the mirror, or they choose to workout literally right next to me when they could go anywhere else.  Further, they will stare at me as I’m working out with intensity as if I cannot see them staring at me like an idiot. 

They see my muscles and my abs and think I don’t see them watching me through the mirror? 
Then, if I am using dumbbells, 9/10 times, they will go get a dumbbell that is slightly heavier than mine and do the same workout.

It’s honestly the weirdest most annoying behavior ever and makes me so irked. My brother tells me I should just befriend them but when they act this way it makes me think they are idiots.

mnfqvy6,1jzn7a6,reddit,"Few things I think could use emphasis, more important for oly lifting but apply pretty broadly

* I think people can over-emphasize stretching/mobility, but a good general warmup including dynamic stretches is excellent for performance and injury prevention, and it's something a lot of people neglect. If your shit is hurting, you may not need to do anything more than a bit of activation work in your warmups to get everything firing.

* Address your injuries proactively - you shouldn't be feeling sharp pain while you're training, if you are something is going wrong and you got to fix it. Fixing it doesn't mean taking time off (although that may be part of it), but it does mean figuring out why your knees/shoulders/etc. are being over-stressed and addressing the root cause. This doesn't mean you have to freak out about every little ache/twinge but it does mean you need to stop popping ibuprofen like tic-tacs instead of seeing a physio that works with lifters/athletes

* Consistency is really all that matters for strength training, both in recovery and in training, so quit fucking around with your programming/exercise selection/micronutrients if you're missing gym sessions or not getting your protein in every day. Any mental energy spent determining the perfect bicep curl variation to use is far better spent finding ways to ensure that you get all your programmed work done.

* Related to the above - I think the best high-level approach to training is to make things as easy as you can on yourself so that you can stay consistent. Find ways to make training as fun as it can be so you show up and get your work done, and avoid trying to implement habits that are difficult to maintain and have marginal positive impact. The former for me was just making training more social/finding a good training group so that I have that accountability structure/have more fun in the gym hanging out with folks, and the latter for me was just not over-committing to excessive volume/not being too draconian with nutrition. Went from having to constantly psych myself up to get into the gym to effortlessly staying on-plan for months, and it's been ~nice~",2025-04-16 16:53:35,2,NorthQuab,fitness

Been running 531 for a long time focused on hypertrophy/higher volume and recently shifted towards strength and higher intensity. The last couple weeks of workouts have felt amazing and I'm not sure why. Everything is grooving and PRing. For some context I also I had a crippling herniated disc that needed  surgery in the end of 2022. Been rebuilding slow and steady since rehab in spring of 2023.

* Bench: first time feeling comfortable enough to hit 245 lb without a spotter (not a 1RM pr though), and 225x5 without spotter
* Dips: hit 4x80 lbs added PR (BW ~191 lbs)
* Chin/pull ups: 135/125 lbs added 1RMs
* Squat: 325 lb 1RM pr followed by 225x16 rep PR (probably could have done at least 2 more but felt like I'd pass out)
* Some random exercises: glute ham raise with 40 lbs x 8 reps, 45 degree back extension with 175 lbs x 8 reps,
* Maxed out the gym's dumbbells (120 lbs) for DB rows and had to start adding kettlebells to it
* Maxed out a few machines like leg extension, plate row, for a lot of reps
* Surprised by compliments or being asked for form advice a few times the past couple weeks, which rarely ever happens. I don't feel qualified to give squatting advice lol.

moioaxk,1k47c3o,reddit,"I [34M] just started getting back to the gym last week, but I am struggling to even lift the empty barbell on some of the exercises. I used to go to the gym 3 times a week a few years ago, and was making steady progress doing the Stronglifts 5x5. This time around, im doing a different program which I found on YouTube, its pretty similar to 5x5 but with a few more exercises

I don't have any chronic injuries and I think im roughly average sized at 75kg and 177cm. 

I can't figure out if its my form or lack of strength, but I shouldn't be failing workouts this early, I'd imagine.

This is the program. 4 day split, with workout A and B 2 times each.

A: Bench 3x10                 
    Incline Bench 3x10
    Overhead Press 3x10
    Squat 4x8

B: Pullups (negatives for now) 3x10
    Barbell Row 3x10
    Deadlift 4x8
    Bicep Curl 3x10


I'm reasonably confident at the lower body stuff, especially squats. My overhead press was weak even when I used to go years ago. Bench, I can only do a few reps before I start struggling. Ive never done Incline press and have no idea if im doing it right, but I literally had to roll the bar off me when I tried to do it last.

I just fail to understand why im struggling so much now as opposed to before. Maybe because there's more reps but fewer sets, and im not used to the volume? Should I persist with the one im doing or go back to 5x5. It doesnt seem normal that im struggling at the beginning rather than when I've put some plates on the bar.

moj02fg,1k47c3o,reddit,"Like many, I'm sure, I'm only recently getting back into 'trying to get healthier'. Currently, all I'm doing is going for a walk every day after work, and talking a dog with me. I've been at this for almost a week now. 

I'm 36, \~200 lbs, 5'11, and in my youth was relatively active and in shape. I'm not sure what information is helpful, so I'm going to try and provide too much. 

I started doing my after-work walks on.. Thursday? I think? with an app to track steps/distance/etc. I'm using WalkFit because I saw an ad on tiktok and why not. I'm not doing a LOT of walking, mind you - I think I did 1.5 miles or so Thursday, and then doubled that Friday/Saturday, didn't do anything major on Sunday, and then back at it yesterday and today. 

Here's the question part - Yesterday and today, I could barely even make it on the 1.5 mile route I took last week - No way in hell I was going to do the longer route I did on Friday/Saturday, despite having done them without TOO much trouble those days. My issue is that about 2 minutes into my walk, my calves/shins are absolutely killing me. Not really my whole shin, but rather my lower shin/ankle/top of my foot area, and the lower part of my calves. 

I thought after yesterday, maybe it was a 'I should probably be stretching' issue, so I did some stretches today - Mainly just sitting on my knees, toes pointed back behind me and putting some weight back butt-to-heel to stretch my shins, and standing with one leg up behind me pulling my foot/toes up towards my back. 

SO whats my problem? Am I walking wrong (I don't feel like I walk wrong, been doing it for 36-odd years?) or is a stretching thing, or is it just a 'push through and itll get better' thing?",2025-04-23 00:30:03,1,ksims33,fitness

Home-Made Sour Pickled Cabbage/Leafy Greens

Ingredients:

- Cabbage (or whatever other leaves you want)
- Water
- Salt (2% of the combined weight of water + cabbage)
- A food-safe container large enough that the cabbage doesn't fill more than 3/4 of the volume
- A plate, which also fits in that container

Recipe:

1. Wash your hands. Wash your utensils. Wash the cabbage. Do not wash the salt.

2. Peel a few whole leaves off the cabbage and save them. Chop the cabbage into small pieces (your choice, I tend to go for double bite-sized)

3. Weigh the chopped cabbage. Measure out 2% of that weight in salt and add that in. If you can't weigh your salt refer to the notes at the bottom.

4. Mix the salt and the chopped cabbage thoroughly in the container. Your grandmother would use her hands for this don't be scared.

5. Put the plate (which you cleaned, remember?) on top of the salted cabbage. Stack enough other objects on top of the plate to press the cabbage down.

6. After a few hours the cabbage should have wilted a little and there should be salty leaf water in your container. Add enough water to cover the cabbage, making sure you track how much was added. Add 2% of the extra water's weight in salt. If there's enough cabbage sweat that it's already fully swimming just skip this step.

7. Use the cabbage leaves saved at the beginning of the recipe to cover the chopped cabbage. Press everything down into the salt water. The goal is for all the vegetables to be fully submerged.

8. Let the container sit covered and unrefrigerated for 3-9 days in a dark place. Check every day, push the leaves back under the water and taste the water for sourness. It will be ready to eat faster in a warmer climate. Store in refrigerator when you are satisfied with the taste.

Notes:

- The water should be like a too salty soup; drinkable but not good enough to serve to your family

- Fermentation is a live process. You will know it's working after 2-3 days when the leaves regularly drift above the water's surface and bubbles appear when you press them back down

- You can add other vegetables. Other kinds of greens, cucumbers, peppers, onions, garlic, etc.

- If you notice new colors, new objects, or bad smells in your cabbage it has spoiled or grown mold. The exception is garlic, which will turn blue or green when fermented. If the color spreads to the other vegetables then the garlic is also bad

- The longer you wait the more sour it gets. Keeps in the fridge for a few months, I wouldn't store it outside for longer than 2 weeks at a time",2025-04-01 22:28:46,1,qpqwo,fitness
mkwuwkn,1jor2wb,reddit,"Hi, I’m looking for a protein bar recipe with pea protein (unflavoured) that has a balanced profile (like 20g prot, 20 carbs, 10 fats) that I can prepare for the week. So far, I’ve been finding whey protein recipes, and it looks like whey protein binds much much better than pea protein.

I can trade a cashew cream recipe that helps with any rice or potato dish, even steamed potato and kale.

200g cashews

Couple of tablespoons of yogurt of your choice (I can’t do cow, so I do goat, it works fine, soy works fine too)

Juice of half a small lemon (just over a tblspoon)

Just over a tblspoon of apple cider vinegar

Salt to taste (a pinch works fine, 2 tastes better but isn’t necessary)

Soak the cashews overnight. If you are in a hurry, just bring water to a boil, stop the fire, dump the cashews in the water and wait 20min.

Blend everything.

You can add chives and parsley for taste.

I do these things in bulk, so I don’t add fresh garlic as it becomes very pungent after a couple of days, but if you have a few mouths to feed, garlic certainly adds taste and micros.

I do this over packaged cream cheese because can’t do cow and can control salt. Macros are dominated by cashews, so above 70% fat, and then roughly 15% prot and carbs, so go easy on it, but it can really help if you are trying to bulk and looking with despair at your rice and greens dish at the end of your day.",2025-04-01 20:12:35,1,Tom_Barre,fitness

mn29c9t,1jysqut,reddit,"Hey guys,


since it's Monday, I got two questions that might be moronic:


1) how much does cutting affect your lifting weights and performance? So far, I've been able to keep my weights and reps, some I could raise slightly, but moving them becomes harder and harder, and I need more rest between sets.


2) how important is clean eating for losing fat and getting to see them abs? I've been cutting before, so I know CICO works, but I'm not the cleanest eater and fear it might affect my goal. E.g. I haven't eaten today yet, and was thinking of treating myself to Asian buffet or even Burger King (love that whopper) after my workout today. Alternative is hitting a store and buying some stuff for cold dinner (cheese, meat, bread), as I'm staying in a hotel all week (no water heater or stove available)

mo4ya5i,1jysqut,reddit,"Should I buy a Stationary/Spin Bike?

Buying a Spinbike/Home Stationary bike worth it? I'm creating a new discussion because it seems like the latest posts are over 5-10 years ago which makes me concerned if this tool is completely irrelevant now.

Background: Our neighborhood suddenly started locking the basketball court in front of my house every 10 p.m. up until 4 am. Most probably, it's because of the noise and the people in the area started complaining on the noise of the basketball bouncing and the ring clanking everytime somebody plays in the middle of the night. Fair enough, I totally get that since somedays, some players get into a fist fight whenever they don't pay the losing bet. The only issue is that I jog there every 1 am and it became a habit of mine.

As a working student, it's so fucking difficult finding the time to workout especially if I'm super tired with academics and having to do a full time job at night. For context, I work 9 hours at night and 7-8 hours at school every weekdays and Saturday. I only get sundays off but I do acads stuff that day.

I recently bought a pull up bar, bench press and 40kg dumbells and went from 88kg back in November 2024 to 77.5kg today. I am really proud of this but I miss the cardio, tbh. Apparently, a rough breakup is sucu a good motivation to improve yourself.

Can I just go for a run in my neighborhood? Yes, but the reason why I jog on the basketball court in front of our house is because it's close enough where I could still be within 100 meters away from my work pc (I work at home) and answer any important emails that comes through. I usually do my workouts at nights and just slap it in their while I am working.

I would honestly love to buy a bike but when it is 42°c during the day, compunded with having poor urban infrastructure to support biking in my city/country, and horrible drivers, I am leaning towards not buying it as I see it as not worth it because:

A. I could get hit by vehicles or get stuck in traffic especially during the mornings.

B. Its fucking hot or its always raining when its not.

C. I need to go far to get in cardio whereas I could spend that time sleeping at home and taking power naps.

Also, I already have a motorcycle that I use to go to school so I do not need another form of transportation.

I tried running after shift but whenever I do it, I would often lose energy and focus during the day at school or whenever I do it after, I am extremely tired where it just sucks. Right now, I am trying to do jump ropes but it keeps fucking up my knees as I am not good with it yet.

I recently found a cheap $60-$80 spinbike/stationary bike online that I am keen on trying out. I tried treadmills and it fucking sucks and boring. Realistically, I probably will not be able to afford a good one anyways as a broke college student. The sub $100 ones suck and can only be used for walking.

My only downside for a spinbike is maybe it is boring and takes up too much space in our small apartment. But, I just want to find a way to keep moving and doing cardio while there is a downtime at my work or whenever I don't need to study.

Will this purchase make sense?

TL;DR: busy college student during the day, working at home full time at night wants to buy a cheapo exercise bike to find a way to do cardio but not go far away to do workouts while working at night.",2025-04-20 19:18:49,2,Dwight321,fitness

Biting the bullet asking for critique, aware this may be a faux pas so mods feel free to delete if so.

**Training age:** History of c.5 years serious strength training, then a five-year layoff to January this year. Have been running Greyskull LP with a focus on strength since then and glad to say the rate of return of strength and size has been really good.  
**Prior Programs:** Starting Strength, 5/3/1, Candito 6 Week, PHUL, Greyskull (all but Greyskull run years ago)

**Stats:** 29 y/o, 5'10 98kg (currently on a cut, about 20% bf)  
**e1RM:** SQ 165kg, BP 132kg, D 170kg, OHP 68kg

**Program aim:** To move away from the strength-focussed training I have always done and towards hypertrophy work to build a more balanced physique and generally try something new and have fun. I have noticed all the old aches and pains I had from lifting years ago have basically come back and I am sick of feeling ""crunchy"", in particular I have a bad right SI joint that is just annoying me in day-to-day life.

I therefore want to cut back on squats and deadlifts, and introduce higher reps and things I've never really done like vertical pulls/rows and lots of arm work. I want to focus predominantly on growing the muscles that are weak points for me with my history of focusing on S/B/D.

**Proposed split:** A four-day Upper/""Lower"" split with each day built around a main compound lift and then accessories. Maybe slightly contradictory to my aim to pivot from strength work, but I do enjoy compounds still, particularly my presses. I have built back work into every day as this is an area that I enjoy, recovers quickly, and is a weaker point, so the Lower days are also quite upper-body focused.

My trainer has added them to my routine. I've watched videos on how to do it but I find them really hard. When I set the pins to parallel I can't get under the bar and I have no idea why. My body just won't 'fit'? I can squat to below parallel so I don't get it.

I set the pins higher than parallel but as soon as I put any weight on the bar the 'squat' instantly transforms into the top half of a good morning. It's frustrating! I just can't get my body to do what I want it to do and what I know it can do (with regular squats)

Basically, I have this belly pooch that just will not go. 
I weigh 50.8 kg and have very little abdominal fat (literally had an inconclusive abdominal CT scan because of this). 

I know there is a difference between usable abs and visible abs but I really really want visible abs as well. 
I have been away from gym due to sickness but looking to go back once all cleared. I was strength training and doing mat pilates but this pooch would 👏🏼not 👏🏼move 👏🏼. 

What can I do differently this time around? Thank you 🖤",2025-04-18 09:29:51,2,curious-14,fitness

Eating about 1750 calories a day and the scale seems to be stuck at 163.

Workout as follows:

Day 1: chest press, chest fly, shoulder press, shoulder lateral, tricep extension.

Day 2: lat pull down, row- lat focus, upper back row, rear delt fly, bicep curl, sit ups, back extension

Day 3: planks, deadlift, hack squat, leg extension, leg curl, rdl, calf raises.

Day 4: extended cardio

All sets 3x10

Cardio is either interval training on treadmill, stairmaster, or hiit bike.

5’4, 103 lbs 

I work out usually 3x a week, doing a mile run, pull ups, assisted pull ups and dips, bench (just the bar lol), a bunch of ab exercises, squats, and other random ones mixed in.

mk0gd9n,1jkzm89,reddit,"What factors go into determining the 'severity' of DOMS, in your experience? 

Long story short, life came at me fast in 2025. My training has been intermittent and I've not trained back-squat since December. Holy gee-fuck are the DOMS way more severe than I've ever experienced before. 

I'm trying to work out - as much for my own interest as anything else - why DOMS feel so much more severe now compared to previous times I've taken long breaks from a lift. Basically: Is there something I could've done to cause/avoid more severe DOMS than usual. 

I'm aware that DOMS: varies from person to person; will probably be worse if nutrition is worse; will be worse if the session was more intense; will be worse if you're sedentary in the days following... but as far as I can tell all of these things are roughly the same as they were last time I took a long break from squatting (hip injury)... But DOMs feels so much more severe... Any other factors I'm not thinking of? (Obviously not leaving a ~3 month gap in my training would have made the DOMS a lot less severe lol )

For context: for the first session back I gradually eased up to very sub-maximal weights (2pl for 4 sets of 5-6). Lifts felt very easy, bar a little stiffness as i started warming up, it felt to me in the moment like I took it very slow and didn't push myself too hard. Bar moved fine. 

Context if it's relevant: M/34/5'2''/73kg; forever intermediate; 2024 5rms OHP/DL/SQ: 80/150/145kg ; program in 2024 was modified 448 run 3-4x/week.

I'm 201cm and started at 127.5kg, and I used a website to calculate my TDEE as about 2850 kcal a day. I set a goal of 10-20% less than that a day, and so far that's been very successful. It's been nearly three weeks and at my last weigh in this morning I'm down to 122.7, so nearly 5kg lost.

However, the TDEE spreadsheet suggest that my actual TDEE is 4260 calories per day. That seems completely ludicrous, right? Here's a screenshot of the numbers: https://imgur.com/a/cP1dt8K

* Pull (no DL, add cardio) - Rows 4x8, Lat pulldowns 4x8, Reverse flys 3x12, Preacher curls 4x8, reverse grip curls 3x12, 20-30 minutes cardio
* Legs (No squat, add RDL and Glute) - Leg Press 4x8, RDL 4x8, Glute Ext 4x8, Quad Ext 3x12, Leg Curls 3x12, Calf Raise 4x8
* Push - (rep change, add cardio) BP 4x8, shoulder press 4x8, decline 4x8, flys 3x12, tricep pushdown 4x8, dip machine 3x12, cardio 20-30 minutes 
* Coredio (added core) - weighted crunches 4x8, back extension 4x8, trunk rotations 4x8, 45 minutes cardio

mltz39l,1jtfbm7,reddit,"Stupid question alert (I guess here is the place for it)...!

Currently doing starting Keto and doing light exercise with the intention of weight loss and general health/fitness. Not fussed about getting ripped or anything or hyper athleticism.

Using a Garmin watch to track activity, and Chronometer to track food.

Baseline maintenance calories on Garmin and checked with other sources comes out as ballpark 2200 kcal, daily activity comes out at around 1700-2500 kcal (walking couple of KM to work n back, exercise bike), giving a TDEE of around 3900-4700 kcal.

Using various Keto calculators for my size/weight it's putting my macros at around;

140g protein

30g carbs

105g fat

However when I input these into Chronometer it gives me a 1600 kcal total energy target, and then says 'totals don't match' against a 2200 kcal energy target (i.e. around my baseline, with my exercise being the deficit for weight loss).

Should be some scope for some calories there that aren't macros (? is that a thing beyond like, alcohol and the like?) and that it's suggesting a daily deficit of around 2000 kcal - which seems very extremely - possibly dangerously so?

Previously when on MFP a few years ago when I managed to lose an equivalent amount of weight (before having a kid and putting it all back on...) it wasn't like this, and would let me set (I assume broadly similar) macros like the above and a daily target of ballpark 2200.

My question is;

\- Am I doing something wrong in my macro calcs/setting up Cronometer/inputting them wrong.

\- Am I using calculators for fit people when I'm a fat fuck?

\- Is Cronometer fundamentally doing something different to MFP?

\- Is my watch way overestimating my exercise levels? Am I over exercising? Under eating/setting wrong goals?

Something isn't quite adding up somewhere and I'm not sure what...",2025-04-07 08:22:22,3,MassiveManTitties,fitness

What do I do now. 

So, I have just successfully completed a 3 month cut. Where I went from 73kg to 65kg. 

I had started on 2200 calories, and ended up at 1500. 


I thought that I’d be able to handle an aggressive cut at the end of the cut, but it seems I am just mentally burnt out. 

From reading online, I’ve decided the next best step for me is to go through a maintenance phase. 

My question is, how long should this phase be. And should I jump directly to my maintenance calories, or reverse diet up to my maintenance?

And if I were to reverse up. How would I go about it? Increase by X amount every 10 days?

- full rack with pull up
- bench (incline/decline)
- Sandbags: 150lb, 200lb, up to 300lb
- Kettlebell: 15, 30, 60
- Assorted bands
- Dip bars

As for the plate issues - I can deadlift my max plates (255) easy, and I squat it with some warm up as well. Bench I can do about 185 for 3-5 reps. At this point I'm not looking to hit PR or anything. I like lifting big. I like doing my sandbags (I can shoulder 200 and do pretty good carries). 

I think in short I just don't know what my goal is anymore? I think it's more I just want to be strong, healthy, and look good for my wife. Which luckily she says I am but...you all know how it is. Get a little bit of a belly or just feel winded at a weird time. Or is this age??

1. Cut a bit more for sharper performance and mobility (core-heavy training feels harder when bulking, due to water/carb bloat around the stomach)

2. Maintain and keep going the way I have been

3. Start a clean bulk to add some more muscle mass, even if it means some minor bloat.

ml9mvrl,1jqdj5e,reddit,"Is there a way to estimate your target body weight given basic strength goals (maybe pr for deadlift/squat/ bench press or whatever), goal body fat percentage, and height? Basically looking for how much muscle weight per height is generally required for say, bench pressing 1.5x your body weight.

Why: I set my goal weight at the start of my strength training journey a year and a half ago, and I'm now pretty easily cutting to that weight with ~14% bf, but I'm definitely slowing on my strength progress and I haven't quite hit my first goal. This makes me wonder if my target weight should maybe be higher.

Personal stats: 35yo male 5'11 160 lbs (on target), doing 531, latest week 3's: deadlift 315lbs x3, bench press 225 x2, squat 245x3, overhead press 135x2.

I found these starter goals somewhere in this sub, deadlift 2x body weight, squat 1.75x, bench 1.5, press 1x.

If I do Monday’s workout on Tuesday, then that might interfere with next workout’s Compound lift.
So because I did Monday’s workout on Tuesday, that carries over to other days so I have to do T2 bench on Thursday now even though I have T1 Bench on Friday (all because I did monday’s workout on Tuesday)

But, if I do the tuesday workout as if I didn’t miss Monday’s, then I will risk progression.

Ive been seeing about a -1.4lb per week.  Lifting heavy (usually 1-2 reps before failure) 5 days a week.

Im doing 30 minutes of cardio after every lifting day, keeping my heartrate above 130 BPM, doing incline walking on the treadmill.  I average about 11K steps a day.  Saturday is my active rest day, I do yoga.  Sunday is full rest day, then repeat my week.

My goal here is to retain as much muscle as possible, while loosing at much body fat as I can.  Ive seen some slight strength decrease so far on my lifts (bench went from 195 to 185).  I plan to cut until May 1st, so its a 2 month cut in total.  My only questions would be is a deficit of 700 too aggressive? and is doing my 30 mins of cardio 5 days a week too much?

moggw2d,1k51qeb,reddit,"I started doing assisted pull ups in November.  I do three sets.  I max out the machine weight at 140 lbs.  I believe progress has been slow since as doing 10 - 12 reps (total) per workout doesn't seem like too much.  Realistically it could be that I was trying to lift too much and it would have been better to have a machine that could go up to 200lbs.  

I don't think this is a routine critique request, but just in case my details are male, 280lbs, 3 sets x 140lbs, 35+ years old, my goal is increasing workout volume.  I am working through a shoulder injury which should only limit me if I am above a very high rep number, typically 18 for other shoulder exercises.  I couldn't raise my hand above my head 16 months ago, so I believe it is handled and only mentioned it because of my rep limit.  

I kept at it and I hit 21 reps last workout.    My rep count is now consistently going up.  I normally use session volume as a measurement of progress, but that seems off here.  No goals except I want the numbers to get lower/higher.  I don't care if I can do a pull up unassisted, although I expect it to happen at some point.

My lift progression started to slow about 3 weeks ago and is now basically fully stalled.

mm47hog,1ju92km,reddit,"Hi,
I recently joined a chain gym looking to start lifting heavy. 

I paid for a training intro, specifically to check my routine and make sure my form was good so I don't hurt myself. 

After a quick look at my spreadsheet, the trainer said that I'm not ready. It'll take me two years at least to get into the freeweight section. Is that right? I'm new to lifting, I'm absolutely okay starting square one, but two years seems wild. I used to play competitive sports, I have an active job and life otherwise. Plus, I got cleared by a physio to start working out.  So what's the deal? Can someone be too out of shape to do a sumo squat or a deadlift?

Please let me know because I really want to lift heavy stuff.

Please note, I've settled on full body routines due to my schedule. 


Routine A- Monday & Friday
Squats, 4x8 reps
Bench press , 4x8reps
Bent over row, 4x8reps
Shrugs, 4x10reps
Barbell Curls (inside grip), 4x8 reps
Barbell incline press, 4x8reps

Session B -Wednesday

Bench press , 4x8reps
Bent over row, 4x8reps
Deadlift, 4x8reps
Shoulder press, 4x8reps
Bicep curls (Barbell or free wights, whatever free), 4x8 reps

mkinm10,1jn8g84,reddit,"I have a question about setting up a home gym. My (rented) house is relatively small, although I do have a basement. The agreement between my housemates and I is that basement is intended as a multipurpose room - can be used for working out/spreading out a big craft project/etc., with nothing permanent taking up space in the center of the room. I'd like to have a home gym setup where I can do the major compound lifts (squat, bench, deadlift, press, etc). For that, it seems like I would need at least a half squat rack (?), a bench, and a barbell (obviously). How feasible would it be to have an equipment setup that could ""expand"" and ""fold up"" as needed? I know that some styles of benches have wheels on one end - could it be leaned vertically against the wall when not in use? What are other space-conserving ideas that could reduce the footprint of the workout area?

So, basically my whole adult life, I've been in this constant cycle of getting quite fit and in good shape, and after that getting lazy for a a year or two and then starting to exercise again. I always get such a high amount of pleasure out of doing cardio when I start and for about six months I get a lot of it easily from that so I keep doing it. And then, when the pleasure comes down, I stop doing it, and often for years.

Any way, the last few times I've done this sporting spree, I've even had tracking of heart rate and other data to see how my performance increases and vo2max estimate increases. And each time, they have done so, rapidly.

But not this time. For about 6 weeks now, I've been super active after doing basically nothing for 1.5 years. My mood, energy has gone up, but my vo2max hasn't increased a bit. I've done work in every heart rate zone. A ton of walking, quite a lot of cycling at 50-65% of max and also elliptical trainer at a little more heavier load and then running, which still gets quite anaerobic quite quickly.

This isn't something that I'm even that after about, mostly I'm just doing sports because it's good for my health and it's fun and a ton of pleasure is what makes it easy to do. But something must explain why this time my vo2max hasn't increased a bit. My resting heart rate has gone down quite a bit already, and my pulse wave velocity has also gotten better.

mkr0tpz,1jn8g84,reddit,"I want to try and make my routine as best as I can.  I have been going to the gym since 2023 september, but up until last year september, I was not really taking it seriously, and was experimenting with different splits. This split has helped me progress the most. I'm a 17 year old male, 5'9 / 5'10, at 90kg. My only goal with this routine was to get lean, I dropped from 105 since september. My daily routine consists of gym + as many steps as I can, usually over 10k. Over time I plan to increase my compound lifts as well as I can. I apologize if the way I wrote my workout is confusing.

I also have a **condition / injury** for a few months that has been limiting me with my lifting. My right inner elbow hurts with movements that include elbow movement. Especially triceps. Dumbbell press is the only chest exercise that does not hurt, with an elbow sleeve. Any isolation movement for my triceps hurts, and I have to go light with many reps. It cracks? on the **eccentric** / way back up (im not sure eccentric is the right word). The only time I can isolate my triceps well is if after my chest exercises, with a straight bar or V bar and I keep my elbows close, very close to my body, and I take it slow. It has been very frustrating to continue with this.

**Q.2 Is this kind of ""patchwork"" routine dangerous, or can I keep going with it ?**

I (25M) can't stick to a programm if I don't enjoy it, haven't been able to stick to a well-known workout plan for that reason. I read the FAQ, so I wanted to go ahead and say it ; I realise it's not the most optimal routine, but I'm not looking for crazy massive gains. I want to have fun exercising, and not it being a chore. I actually have been enjoying this training and look forward to it now and sticking to it for the past 5 months, with some variations/evolutions.

*To make reading easier, I do all my gym workout in a 3-sets-of-12 set up, so I won't be repeating that everytime.*

**Day 1 - calisthenics :**

* I go to the street workout park running, 20min there and 20min back
* Pushups (pausing at the bottom of rep) + dips + triceps bench dips + stretched lunges, a bit of ab wheel (just started that, can't go into a full ROM, knees on the ground)
* Pull ups (3x5-6), after an increase in the volume I could do, my form has improved to be pretty clean (full dead-hang and chin above bar), but I've been plateauing for a while: can't get more volume, can't get chest-to-bar. My PR is barely 10rep, butchering the end a bit

**Day-2 Gym - Back workout :**

* Lat pull downs (43kg)  |  Shoulder press (41kg)  | One-arm rowing (16kg)  |  Rear delt fly (39kg)  | seated rows (39kg)  |  Roman chair back extension (with 10kg)

**Day-3 - Climbing gym**

I will spend about 1h30 there, climbing around a 6A level

**Day-4 Gym - Legs and whatever I feel like doing :**

* Squats (80kg)  |  Hip abduction (39kg)  | Calves raises (18kg)  |  Leg press (90kg) or Prone leg curl (30kg)  |  Bulgarian squats (the nightmare... 14kg)
* I then add 2-3 exercises of what I feel like doing on that day, usually a mix of pecs and biceps/triceps
   * Dumbell press (16kg)   |   Pec fly (love the stretch, 52kg)  | Triceps pull (18kg) or machine (54kg)  | Hammer curl (9kg)

My goal is to improve my overall health and not feel constantly tired and sleepy. I spend a lot of time sitting at work and then just sleeping at home, skipping meals a lot of time because I just don't have any appetite or am tired to cook or even just eat precooked meals.  

What I do so far -> threadmill since it was the easiest equipment to use at first, some exercises on a mat (which I take from youtube videos), back extension, lat pulldown, hip adductor/abductor machine, squats with dumbbells, elliptic trainer. (I know I'm all over the place, hence the need for the routine). 

Results so far -> 
1: I like doing cardio a lot, allows me to just de-stress after work without the need to count or think about things (reps, which exercise after which, sets). 
2: I feel like I'm gaining appetite and drinking more water. 

Fear -> I don't want to lose fat or weight as I'm already skinny and weak as it is, I don't mind gaining muscle. (26F, 47kg on a bloated day).

* Squats
* Bench Presses

* Arnold Press
* Stiff-Legged Deadlifts
* Barbell Curls

After barbell curls - as of recent - I've added two isolation exercises such as finger curls and overhead tricep extensions to develop my arms; and with all of the those exercises from Allpro I've gained a great deal of progress, especially since I can only manage to do 2 days per week.

I am a programmer and data scientist, so I can't really avoid it. I played football (I mean soccer) to 14, then shortly came back later to play indoors. Other than that, I am always trying some programs, mostly at home, but have time to hit the gym sometimes when I am not too busy. My posture got really wrecked from being ""IT guy"" from my early teens and also from playing guitar often.

I tried various programs in the gym or home like: Overtime Athletes, High School program from Triphasic training by Cal Dietz (bad idea, these programs were too specific for speed, not focusing on fundamentals since they assumed fundamentals were already developed.). Then tried Reinessance Psriodisation At Home Hypertrophy program. Gained some muscle mass, was slightly stronger but posture or feet didn't really improved through any of that. Tried also some ATG or E3rehab excercises on my own created program then and still got no significant improvements while being tired.

The only thing that really works for me now effectively:

Program from book of Dr. Tommy John:. Minimize Injury, Maximize Performance: A Sports Parent's Survival Guide Kindle Edition. Anyone familiar with this book? Workouts from here are doing wonders to my body! I finally feel like something is working to fix my poor posture! Example of the excercises here: Calf jumping on place, Standing straight leg hip rotations (front, side, back, total 100 reps), squat hold + marching or A-skip (superset) , isometric lunge + kettlebell swings, iso chest hold + straight arms dumbbells drop, iso chest hold + scapular pull-ups, 50 calf raises, spinal focused excercises (Dr Tommy John's ""spinal hygiene"") like various neck rotations, rolling down the spine while standing and shoulders back and opening chest when going upwards and maybe the best excercise: crazy 100 reps of Cross-Crawl supermans.

Is there a difference between each of these routines? I personally find it hard to run 20 minutes non stop and get very exhausted, but I can run 10-10 fairly well, and the 10 minute break really helps me. Just for reference, I'm a Male in my 20's, and I run on 8km/h.

Also just a small question, how important is stretching before running? I've been stretching for around 5 minutes before each workout. Is it very helpful, or just negligible?

I am a pretty skinny and scrawny guy I am 5'11 and around 180Ibs. My goal is to grow bigger more attractive muscles. I am looking at 2 routines right now. The first one is 5/3/1 for Beginners on the wiki and ppl x Arnold. My problem with these two is that neither had a distinct day for abs. I know the 5/3/1 has you do 100 reps of an ab exercise each time you workout, but I want a day specifically for abs. My current ab workout routine is: hanging leg raises, reverse crunch on decline bench, decline sit-ups, cable crunches, ab rollouts, and planks. (again this is probably not the best workout but I want something with this type of intensity, Also I didn't add reps or sets because I am not trying to get this routine rated, just explaining what I would like to do) So my main questions come down to: 1. Which of these 2 is best for my goal? Or is there another routine that works better for my goal? 2. If one of these two routines works for my goals can I just add an ab workout routine to a free day or workout twice a day one day a week.",2025-04-10 05:59:04,0,Novel-Ad-9927,fitness

mk6l4z9,1jlqras,reddit,"I'm very much in doubt whether to update my barbell set. I have a really rubbish set with a 25mm bar and about 60kg of weights. 

I currently see an offer for a new set with a 30mm bar and about 110kg of weights for about 340 EUR, plus whatever a shorter bar costs (lack of space for a 170cm long one). 

Thoughts: Thanks to a muscle condition (plus possibly age) I will never be very strong. I don't have a gym nearby that I could use. I'm currently deadlifting 40kg plus bar weight, but I only started again about 3 weeks ago. It's unlikely I'll ever get past the current set for anything but DL and Romanian. But for those I'd need to puzzle with 1.25 and 2.5kg disks just to get past 40kg on the bar. I can't get more weights for my old 25mm bar because I can only move thin cast iron ones with grip due to hand/fingers cramping up, and those are neither available new nor second hand. 

Thoughts? It's a substantial investment. If I let it pass I might later have to pay about 420 EUR. Not sure whether I'll stick to lifting (last time I stopped due to moving and having even less space)",2025-03-28 13:40:56,1,orbitolinid,fitness

Problems I see: I need to unload most of the weights to get the bar up there as I'm not very strong due to a muscle condition. And I'm not sure whether it's possible to add weights when on this rack due to stability.

Anyone use those kind of racks and can (not) recommend them?",2025-03-26 10:57:19,1,orbitolinid,fitness

I just joined a gym and started exercising with a plan for the first time. My goal is to just get stronger. I have a decent diet and have been on a calorie surplus. I pieced together what I have here from exercises I've tried and liked so far. Any feedback is appreciated.

# ROUTINE

* Alternate between Lower and Upper body days, about **3x a week**.
* **3-4 sets of 10x** on the machines for each exercise, and **20 min cardio** on the stairmaster at the end. If I can't make it to the gym I try to do the at home version without the cardio. I have dumbells and resistance bands at home, but I'm too intimidated to use the freeweights at the gym because I don't know what I'm doing and the area is always crowded with really buff people.
* I drink a 12oz protein shake before workout.
* I feel like I'm putting in effort, but other than the very first arm day which destroyed me for a week, I haven't felt much soreness since. I get self consious because everyone seem to be exercising with composure and I sound like I'm giving birth while on the lowest weight.

**Lower Body**:

* Leg press
* Calf raises
* Hip abductor / Hip adductor (inside/outside thigh)
* Seated Leg curl / leg extension
* Back extensions

**Upper Body:**

* Assisted Pullups
* Assisted dips
* Rows
* Chest press
* Overhead press

**At Home:**

* Table pull ups
* Romanian deadlift
* Glute bridge
* Clamshell
* Fire hydrant
* Walking lunges
* Plank",2025-03-26 21:04:14,1,adei0s,fitness

For context my height is 5'7 and I'm in my mid 20s. I am definitely fat but not obviously so in non tight clothing. I currently weigh 77KG/ although even as low as 63KG as I was like a year and a half a go I still had a flabby stomach. I'm currently aiming to get back down to 70KG while still doing strength training but don't know what I should be aiming for to have an actual flat stomach and chest.

I am using the GZCL strength training. I've been doing it for around 10 months and much more consistently for like 7/8. These are my current highest weights for 5 sets of 3 reps:

Squat - 100 KG/ 220lbs

Bench - 55 KG/ 121lbs

Deadlift - 95 KG/ 210lbs

Overhead press - 27.5 KG/ 61lbs

I would appreciate as genuine an answer as possible on this, am I weak? These numbers are definitely higher than when I started but I feel like the bench/overhead press in particular are really hard for me to get much higher than this and they rely on the most arm strength vs squatting where I know I have comparatively thick legs.

I haven't taken a deload since December, but my bench has always either stayed the same or increased since then. However, on Sunday, I could only do 265x6, and today, I could only do 265x5. I'm unsure if I should take a deload, a few days/a week off, or something else. I'm currently doing PPL and here are my push days:

* Bench
*  Dips/weighted dips
*  Chest fly
* Tricep pushdown/pulldown of some sort
* Lateral raises

I do 3 sets with each exercise and take them all to failure. Additionally, after the last set of each of the last 3 exercises, I stay on the machine for as long as I need to to get at least an additional 4 reps in. I do 10+ reps each set except for bench and weighted dips. I've been sleeping 9+ hours every night and eating at/above maintenance. I don't think this is a lot of volume, but I could be wrong. Here is a short pros/cons list of each option:

\- Not do anything different

* Pros: It would save my sanity for the time being, and I don't have a lot of volume, so I'm not sure if I could be overtraining
* Cons: I'm not sure how my bench would improve

\- Deload week

* Pros: I think science says this is better than a week off and this could give my muscles rest
* Cons: I'll probably overdo the training and although I might not be taking exercises to failure, they'll probably be close

\- Week off

* Pros: It could be the rest I need
* Cons: I may not need it and end up wasting a week thinking it might help

\- Take 3 days off and come back on Sunday and try again

* Pros: It doesn't require a full week, and I may only need a few days off. If it's still not 265x7, I can take the rest of the week off
* Cons: I may need the full week off and need the additional rest without the benching, or I may not need any rest at all, wasting a few days

2 lifts in particular for me, the bench press and the barbell squat.

As far as squats are concerned, I'd say it's a bit more skewed. I'll feel completely gassed by the fourth rep, but can get to ten by taking those brief pauses at the top of the rep.

Hey everyone! I’m trying to accurately calculate my TDEE and would love some input on what activity level I fall under. Here’s what I currently do:

I walk 15,000 steps a day, mostly on a treadmill at 6–6.4 km/h (about 1.5 hours), with around 3,000 steps coming from general movement at home.

I do 3 strength training sessions per week, each lasting around 1.5 hours.

I also do 1 Pilates session per week (40–60 minutes, full-body).

All my workouts are done at home using dumbbells, a barbell, glute bands, and a mat.

Exercise 1-3 times/week

Exercise 4-5 times/week

I like doing the same routine 2  times a week, with the weight simply being what I can barely get to by the end, and increasing as I go. Looking to build muscle and strength (general fitness improvement)


39m 75kg with basic home gym equipment: pull up bar, barbell, dumbbells, bench (flat; doesn't incline), medicine ball, tredmill


Current routine (all three sets):
//Pull-ups (usually 7, 5, 3). 
//Deadlift 
//Barbell overhead press
//Concentration curls
//Bench press with dumbells
//Reverse push ups on bench


Extra if I have time: bicycle crunch, Russian twist with medicine ball, pushups occasionally. Also I run/swim/ride my bike for cardio but I'm cool with that


Any key/great/efficient exercises that I'm missing, that I could add? (considering the equipment I've got)

Today was day 3 of week 2, so squat & bench + accessories day. My barbell bench press AMRAP was 5 x 80kg(176lbs). My squat AMRAP was 6 x 85kg (187lbs). (For completeness my deadlift AMRAP is 6 x 122kg(268lbs) & my OHP AMRAP is 6 x 45kg (99lbs)).


Any idea why my squat is so weak compared to my other lifts? What additional exercises can I do to help strengthen it?


When I'm doing the squat AMRAP set I know my legs have more in them, but after rep 6 today I started seeing black spots and my body felt incredibly fatigued - but i think i had a few more reps in my legs... once I racked the bat and took a few breaths i felt fine again like i could go and do another 4 or 5 (but followed the program dropping the weight down and doing the 5x5).

mnyd3o7,1k2s2eu,reddit,"Hi everyone! I started working out a month ago and i’d love some feedback on my current full-body workout plan. I train 3 times a week, and each workout lasts around 2 hours. My goal is hypertrophy (also recomping atm). Stats: 26M, 185cm, 81kg.

Here’s my routine by order:

|Exercise|Sets|Weekly Sets (x3/wk)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Squats|3|9|
|Romanian Deadlifts (RDLs)|3|9|
|Bench Press|4|12|
|Lat Pulldown|4|12|
|Shoulder Press Machine|4|12|
|Triceps Overhead Cable Extension|4|12|
|Preacher Curls|4|12|
|Back Extensions|3|9|
|Lateral Raises|4|12|

Is the weekly volume per muscle group balanced for hypertrophy? (including indirect work)  
Should I add a Hammer Row Machine for 3 sets to get more upper-back work?",2025-04-19 17:05:04,-2,lidord1999,fitness

mn9wy6w,1jzn7g9,reddit,"Hi, I have a problem with pull-ups — I can’t seem to do more of them, and it feels like nothing is changing. I’ve been going to the gym for over 3 years now. I started with 3 pull-ups, gradually got stronger, and eventually could do 7–10 in the first set, then fewer in the next sets. But once I hit that rep range, everything just stalled.  Some days I can only do 6 max, sometimes I hit 10, then the next week I might only manage 5 again. I always train to failure in every set. I’ve tried all sorts of methods — adding weights, doing more sets — literally everything, but my numbers don’t go up. Once I hit a max of 11 reps, that’s where it’s stayed for the past year or two.  I go to the gym 3–6 times a week (the frequency has changed over time). All my other lifts have been progressing well — I’ve gotten stronger across the board. What’s strange is that my back actually looks really good — probably the best-looking part of my physique — but my pull-up strength just won’t improve.  Has anyone dealt with something similar and can help out? I’m really fed up.

As far as I’ve planned I’m going to spend one day with just deadlifts. One day with squats/shoulder press and the other day with pushing/pulling. 

I want to incorporate unilateral movements as much as I can but I also like doing combination exercises such as barbell squat to shoulder press etc. (I don’t prioritize it as much as unilateral movements)

Now there are two issues with this: One problem is the weight might not match the muscles. For example if I were to do barbell squat to shoulder press, the weight might feel too light for my legs and too heavy for my shoulders especially considering I won’t be able to make more than 5 reps. The other issue is I feel like doing everything at the same time like a circus clown and not keeping it simple might backfire

mnsi7sg,1k20erh,reddit,"Please let me know if this is question is allowed or I'll take it down!! Can I use this routine below to build muscle? Or is it only good for strength training? 

The routine: (A few years ago, I joined a program at the gym that was more strength training based vs hypertrophy I'd say). We'd do first 15 minutes of a couple exercises like box jumps and kettlebell swings. And then the next 45 minutes would be lifting (full body), like 2 leg exercises (we'd rotate between squat variation, deadlift, RDL's), 1-2 exercises for back (pull-ups and single arm dumbbell rows, maybe something with a cable sometimes), bench press for chest, and single arm dumbbell press for shoulders. The rep scheme would typically be around 3x8. My plan is to do this 3x a week. 

When I first started this, I only did this twice a week and I lost 20 pounds in 10 months with no changes in diet and I maintained that for 8-9 months easy. Then after that, I moved and didn't know what to do and I gained weight. I'm 6 pounds heavier now and thinking of following that routine with the same exercises (cuz I loved them and need a routine that incorporates these, especially bulgarian split squats!). Would this routine work? I feel like there's a difference between strength programs vs hypertrophy and wanted to ask.

mnvvsx8,1k20erh,reddit,"Opinion on beginner routine ?

Hello ! 
I’m new here, never really been in the gym before.
I mostly do outdoor activities (Trail Running, Climbing, hiking, ski touring in winter…),
But for all of April I’m stuck abroad for work, and the surroundings of my hotel don’t allow for any outdoor activity
So I’ve decided to hit the gym at the hotel to try to maintain (or improve ?) my fitness.
The idea being mainly going specific for my preferred activities so I don’t loose too much when I get back
I don’t really want to bulk because I don’t want to get bigger ^^ but loosing some fat mass would of course be nice
I’ve looked at several dedicated programs for climbing and a bit of running strength training, and here’s what I made myself :

** Treadmill Running 3x /week (1x easy 40min, 1x intervals (either speed or incline), 1x long run
** Strength training 2x /week like this : 

Super set #1 
4x sets with 3min rest : 
Weighted Pull Ups 5x reps +12kg
Squats with dumbbells 5x reps +30kg

Superset #2 
4x sets with 3min rest : 
Bench Press (dumbbells) 5x reps +36kg
One arm bench Low rows with dumbbell 5x reps +20kg

Superset #3 : 
4x sets 3min rest : 
Shoulder press (with a machine) 7x reps +21kg
Leg curl (machine) 6x reps +42kg

Superset #4 : 
4 sets 3min rest : 
Bulgarian squat 5reps 12kg
Straight Leg raises x10

Regarding climbing I’m just trying to stay fit and gain some upper body strength without bulking
Regarding trail running I’ve got 2 races planned next couple of months, and it’s worth mentioning that on many previous races I’ve experienced cramps in my adductors and quads, which I think are due do lack of strength. I am paying great attention to hydration and food before and during the races


That’s it !

ml4bf1c,1jpk4ab,reddit,"Hi there! I would like some critique on this routine (it is partially home brew). To start off, I’m not a complete beginner (weightlifting about a year, working out on and off for about 5). As for my current stats, I am male, would prefer not to give my age, I am 5’ 7”, 155 lbs, I don’t know if any of my lift numbers will be relevant as I haven’t hit 1 rep maxes for quite some time, but for the basic compound lifts it’s 180 for bench, 260 for squat, and 290 for deadlift (I didn’t do deadlift very much so that was about a 6 month gap between them, all those one rep maxes are from when I was working out on and off). I am aiming for a mix of hyper trophy and strength (hense the 6 reps per set and 5 sets). I rest about 2 minutes after each set and between each exercise. I would be exercising 5 days a week, with a rest day after every leg day. I didn’t include forearms on here as they are worked completely separately in a different activity 4 days a week, so I felt it would be overtraining them to include them in my actual workout too. The reason I’m creating my own right now is I just got out of a weightlifting class and I’m struggling to find a exercise plan that both fits with my goals, and that I have all the machines for. In each exercise I decided to put one compound exercise first and then some isolation exercises right after (strength, then hypertrophy). I think that’s all the basic info I need to give, but feel free to ask if there’s anything I forgot or that’s needed.

StrongLifts to monitor my workouts, I have it set every 3rd work out to increase the weights by 5lbs/3kg. I get almost everything done in about 35-40minutes with 30-50 seconds rest after every set. At the end of my weightlifting I do 10-20 minutes treadmill depends on how I am with time for Work. 

Does this look like a solid routine? Anything you recommend I change? Thank you in advance.",2025-04-05 11:43:48,1,CyberIntrusion,fitness

On January, I was 81.1kg and 23.4% body fat. I have been cutting since, and today I measured at 76kg and 20.3% body fat. 

To my understanding, since I’ve only lost 3% of fat, this would be around 1/3 of the 6kgs I’ve lost during my cutting phase.

mn6p3pd,1jy3gt6,reddit,"I started muay thai classes last July and burned a significant amount of body fat and gained muscle around my hips and leg area. Unfortunately I began to plateau with my progress a few months ago and the issue has come front and center since the newest gym coach has ramped up training and I began to fall behind like when I first started muay thai. I am looking for some at home workouts and exercises that addresses the following issues to supplement my muay thai training. Any equipment needed I would need to limit to freeweights since I honestly can't afford a second gym membership.

My main issue is that while muay thai has done wonders for my legs, my upper body strength and mass is woefully inadequate to  handle my weight of 265lbs. I still cannot do a proper pushup much less the 150 we are asked to do in training. My shoulder and upper back muscles also cannot handle the wheelbarrow handstand exercises or striking drills done during class. Any workouts that can be done with freeweigths to strengthen my upper body would be greatly appreciated

My secondary issue is that I haven't burned much body fat as when I first started. My belly fat is quite stubborn and I am getting discouraged since the belly fat makes it very hard to do sit ups. I don't know if this is more an issue with me getting on a stricter diet or needing a proper workout dedicated to buring fat as opposed to muscle building.

mldg9au,1jr7fa6,reddit,"Question: For someone who has exercised regularly for many years (both weights and cardio in a wide variety/frequency/intensity), is lifting weights more effective for weight loss than cardio? (assuming calorie deficit)

I ask because I’ve heard people say that cardio burns calories while doing it, whereas strength training builds muscle which improves your metabolism which helps you burn more calories throughout the day. I would assume that for someone new to fitness, more focus on weight lifting would definitely be a great way to kick off weight loss. 

However I’m thinking that since I already have a solid foundation, any gains to metabolism would probably be small and therefore more focus on cardio is probably the better way to go?

mldwuam,1jr7fa6,reddit,"Hi all,

I'm making a maintenance lifting routine to support playing tennis. Goal is to keep muscles, avoid injury, and possibly get a bit stronger, but no huge gains. I'm aiming to lift just 2x/week, supplementing the rest of the week with cardio, mobility, and tennis of course.

The workouts would be four leg exercises, a back exercise, and three core/shoulder ones.

My question is: if I'm only lifting 2x/week, is it better to do the same routine twice for consistency and ability to make progress in an exercise/muscle, or have two different routines to be able to target similar muscles in different ways?

Would it be more difficult to make progress or maintain if I'm doing two different routines? The routines would still follow the same format of 4 legs, 1 back, 3 core/shoulders, but I wouldn't revisit a routine for at least a week, maybe even 8 or 9 days.

Thanks!

I am wondering if i should keep going with my cut because if I lose 3 more kilos I will be underweight however I am still feeling great. Or should I stop my cut and focus on eating on maintenance with lots of protein and doing ab exerciseses. Or is it just genetically not posible for me to have abs since I am a woman.",2025-04-18 14:14:07,1,Actual-Specialist166,fitness
