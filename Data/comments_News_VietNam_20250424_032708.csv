Couple what with the weather and pollution and the potential for you to get sick, I would not be planning this intense of an itinerary. 

Both Ninh Binh and Ha Long took 3 hours each way back to Hanoi with the traffic. Haven't been to Sapa but I imagine that's longer. So that's already 12+hrs just sitting in a car plus Sapa.

You don't need a whole day in Hoi An. You can have clothes tailored anywhere in Vietnam and there are plenty of tailors in HCM. Youre putting a lot of faith in someone making a perfect garment without any need for adjustments within a day in Hoi An. Just ask your family in HCM when you're there. Hoi an also only comes alive in the evening/night. During the day it is incredibly hot and dead quiet.

you don't need to stay a night up in Ba Na. You'll see it all within a day and there's nothing on there at night. Go stay in a resort in Da Nang.",3,2025-04-18 23:12:34,pichuru

Travel itself wears me out, so even taking an overnight train from Nha Trang to Hoi An, I could barely convince myself to venture out into Hoi An the day I arrived because I was exhausted from the train - and I actually slept pretty well on it!

Let's take Soviet as example : They helped Germany for their own military and economic benefit, to improve their nation standing against both the capitalist Allies and the Fascist Axis. They can instantly switch side if they see Allies deal are better for them, and vice versa.   
  
Same with Poland, they themselves grab Czechoslovakia land when the partition happened (not very nice ), but the 1934 pact part is misleading : Poland signed that as non-aggression pact, not alliance pact ! They are not the same, for example Molotov - Ribbentrop pact does not mean somehow Soviet join the Axis, it's just mean that Soviet and Germany will not touch other sphere of influence ( for the time being :) )

In conclusion, because history is rarely viewed as black and white, try to claim that Soviet action is worse than Poland or vice versa is meaningless, because we study history to understand the underlying motive of past action more than to give a definitive good vs evil.",12,2025-04-17 19:26:09,Responsible_Board950

Safety/comfort tips:
- If you're gonna bring a decent amount of cash, get a flat bag that you can hide beneath your shirt or whatever so nobody knows you've got money
- Wear fake jewelry only or wear as little jewelry/valuable things as possible because petty theft is common enough
- Travel with a buddy if you can! It's more fun and safer (that goes for anywhere you travel tho lol)
- Bug/mosquito repellent is a must because mosquitos are everywhere...
- Fair warning that Saigon does not smell the best sometimes because the hygiene system in Vietnam is not good—very pretty and fun place tho
- Be wary of the plain water served at restaurants... just drink bottled water for your safety
- Also... bring Pepto Bismol... because again... hygiene over there is 😩

Foods/places:
- Maybe I'm biased as a Vietnamese person, but lowkey 98% of places over there have good food
- ABSOLUTELY visit Bánh Mì Như Lan in Saigon because I've gone there since I was little and the food and desserts are top notch
- Visit the lotus fountain in Saigon at night because it's gorgeous

VietNam,1jz78e1,mn52vdw,"* Dont use taxis. Use Grab or Xanh. Don't just hop on to any guy with a green jacket claiming to be your driver or a driver. ALWAYS USE THE APP to book and confirm.
* Don't get an e-sim, buy one either from the airport or downtown. Make sure it's one with an actual number, data and text. You will need all that if you are going to install something like Zalo, which is used by everyone in Vietnam. Also sometimes your cab driver will call you and you will need a phone number for that.
* Don't do group tours or any tours, unless absolutely necessary. If it's just you, I would strongly recommend to do the Saigon Kiss Tour (its a tour by scooter) and whatever version of that they have in Hanoi.
* Don't waste time travelling from place to place, ignore anyone telling you do rushed tours, like to go from Hanoi to TamCoc in one day and back or from Hanoi to HaLong Bay in one day, etc.
* TPBank ATMS dont charge extra fees for withdraw.
* Google Translate is a must have app.
* Almost anywhere you use credit cards, there will be a 3-6% extra fee. Don't fight it, accept it as a convenience.
* Street food is almost always safe if it's from a well known place, not some random portable vendor from a night market.
* Beware or AirB&B ""experiences"", most of them are scams set up by foreigners exploiting locals.
* Listen to your hotel or homestay staff, they can book stuff for you and can vouch for it, since if it doesn't work as intended, they are the ones stuck with the bad review.

VietNam,1jy06u6,mmutj72,">1) My family plans to get a tour guide, but I don’t think its necessary, what do you all suggest ? 

Vietnam is fairly accessible to DIY given you put some planning into days around the city.

A tour can be booked for day-trips outside the city such as a Mekon Delta or Cu Chi trip. Either private for just your family or a join-in group of varying sizes with other people.

>2) We plan on getting custom made clothes, I know Vietnam is famous for tailoring clothes. Can you guys suggest places to get clothes tailored for a good & affordable price?

Been happy with Chương Tailor and Sir Tailor

>What is the price range for dresses/tops or suits ?

Can vary depending on the fabric you choose.


>3) What places do you suggest we visit ? 

5 days is pretty limited as to what you can see *around* Vietnam.

**Day 1**

Arrival day, depending on when you arrive it could vastly impact your first day. Morning arrivals will allow you to start exploring after dropping off your bags.

**Day 2**

Food trip/cafe hopping/(souvenir) shopping/tailors. If you decide on having something made, visiting a tailor on the first day is advisable so adjustments could be made later into the trip.

**Day 3**

A day tour to Cu Chi tunnels or the Mekon Delta. Both are (half) day tours and could be done on day 3 and day 4 if you decide on doing them both.

**Day 4**

Cultural/Historical/Touristic spots.

Search up any of the walking tours online and note down the points of interest and do it yourself. Do some extra research of popular spots you'd like to visit.

**Day 5**

Self-care day, spa, hair salons, nail techs etc. before your flight home.

For another day or 2D1N trip you could head down to Vung Tau, a beach town not far from Vung Tau. Either stay centrally or go a bit further to relax at a resort.

Question for you if you've ever been to Melaka. What's your personal recommendation where to eat? Coincidentally going to Malaysia tomorrow. I already have a whole list of potential eateries/restaurants but since you posted I'm taking the chance to ask, haha.",2,2025-04-13 06:08:28,paksiwhumba
VietNam,1jy06u6,mmv6rfk,"Malaysian here, went to HCM 2 years ago.

Honestly if you're savvy you don't need a tour guide. 
HCM is actually not that big.

Around District 1 it seems like most locals can somewhat understand English since there are a lot of tourists there.

The outer parts of the city is sort of like travelling from KL to PJ. That's where it might be troublesome cos the locals there don't really understand English. So it'll be a lot of finger pointing and Google translate.

You can get around with the Grab app.

I recommend you try hunting for their Sau Rieng Ri 6 durian if you're into that. They're massive.

If you can, go to any rooftop bar at night for a great view of Saigon river. It's quite spectacular imo.

You will need a travel guide if you plan to do any of the packages outside the city like Cu Chi Tunnels as somebody pointed out.

Just travel around the city and enjoy the views.

October is just right.


Go in the middle of the year, it's hot, humid and rainy. There's not much in the way of street life, because everyone's too hot and bothered, and nobody wants to get rained on. 


I've never been around December-January, but I gather it gets cold and rainy then. I don't want that, but some might who nose.


Last year I was there in April. It was a little on the hot side, and it did rain just a little bit, but overall it was still pretty good. Maybe I should have gone in March instead? But that couldn't have been arranged.


The time I went before though, was October 23, and it was great. I recommend Hanoi at that time of year. Not too hot, not too cold, the whole city smelt of food because of all the pop-up cafes on the street, there were lots of cultural activities on the street (traditional pantomimes, interesting buskers in traditional dress, that sort of thing) and it all felt very cool and frenetic.

As part of our itinerary, we went to Lan Ha Bay, which didn’t feel too crowded or polluted. I didn’t notice any rubbish or hear loud music or karaoke from other boats. That said, it really depends on the cruise you choose and how many people are on board. Ours was relatively small, and it felt great to be part of it.

You will not “win” any conversations with elders if you are younger, and if you’re a lot younger, then it’s considered extremely disrespectful.

Hi all,  
My partner and I have been married for over 5 years. We’re currently working in the Middle East and are exploring real estate investment options in Vietnam.

We're looking into buying an apartment together, but I have a few concerns:

* If the property is under my name (I'm a foreigner), I understand there are restrictions.
* If it's under her name, what are the risks if the relationship ever breaks down?
* Is it possible to have joint ownership (e.g., 50/50)?
* In case of divorce, how is property typically handled in Vietnam?

Some background info:

* Our marriage was registered abroad and still needs to be recognized officially in Vietnam.
* We have a pre-nup from our country of marriage, though I'm not sure how enforceable it is under Vietnamese law.

The ride is pretty short and easy for quick trips. We frequently visited during covid while living in Da Lat during the days when the city wasn't on lockdown.

The Khanh Le pass is very scenic and definitely worth the drive through. Just be careful of larger vehicles.

If you travel before sunrise, wear some gloves since the icy mountain air can be very cold. Some days my hands were stiff to the point it was difficult to move.

No idea about the drive to Hoi An.

In my family, we of course drink both, but tea is consumed so much more. I wouldn't be surprised if it's also the case for most of the other Vietnamese households.

There's a guest coming to our house? Tea. You're pretty thirsty after that one cup of coffee? Tea. You're dining out and that nice meal of yours finally comes to an end? Also tea. It happens to be so damned it *cold* that day? (I'm a Northerner.) Tea again, for most people, including my father. My mother is admittedly more fond of coffee when it comes to this kind of thing. You're planning to hang out and chat with a friend? Again, tea as the most common choice of drinks, while coffee coming in the second place. Those tiny road-side vendors sound just like what we all need. Oh, now you're visiting a close family friend or someone relatively important? Might as well consider bringing dried tea or maybe some other things with you, as a present.

I honestly don't understand where the impression that coffee is a bigger part of our culture comes from. Maybe it's because our green tea is much more bitter and astringent than Chinese green tea? I wouldn't be surprised if the ones who're used to that kind of tea dislike ours. I'm already used to Vietnamese green tea, so to me Chinese teas tend to smell pretty nice but do not really taste like anything at all.

VietNam,1k4upl6,mode46e,"It's not quite the same as Western ""silent treatment"" at least based on my own experience with my Viet bf. Asian communication can be very indirect, she's more likely avoiding escalation while still signalling that she's not ready to reconcile. What usually works for us is cooling off for a bit and then reconciling in a different way like kissing or joking. Only after that can the real topic be discussed, in a mature manner. He's totally surprised me a few times after I had already given up privately. Conversely, he completely accepts it if I'm annoyed for days on end until I finally find the right expression for it.
But the examples where they stay stubborn for weeks might be indicative of deeper issues, I haven't experienced that.",3,2025-04-22 03:14:37,1Tenoch

VietNam,1k4upl6,moda5g8,"They think of it as harmony. They try to minimize any discussion or flat out ignore or lie to avoid conflict and promote harmony. Drove me nuts until I understood it. Still drives me nuts because nothing ever gets resolved. For a Westerner we would see it as kicking the can down the road. They feel that you just shut up, and in time it will go away. I do not want to ever get use to it and I teach my children ( both Vietnamese and mixed Vietnamese) to deal with the issues. Hard still for the full blooded Vietnamese child.
