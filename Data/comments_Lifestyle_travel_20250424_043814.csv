Seoul just does it so so much better, AND it is all much cheaper than Tokyo (when I was going there with yen to convert to won). That and in my experience, speaking zero Korean, I met way more people who's attitude was like, ""fuck it, body language it is!"" or they just outright spoke great English. Japanese people are awesome, moreso if you speak the language, but I feel aren't as quick to approach or be open to a foreigner who does or doesn't speak their language. 

It is also just a way different energy for drinking and going clubbing. Not like this is a gauge or anything, but Koreans are way louder on their nights out, with fun conversations, joking, and laughing, whereas Japanese TEND TO, be more reserved (I have videos to prove the opposite of what I just typed, so yes exceptions exist).

travel,1k0h5gk,mndy1kv,"Maybe this is airline dependent but I have never had any luck joining or linking reservations.  We fly internationally using miles and often are on different reservations and/or itineraries.  The airline is going to probably consider your children as flying unaccompanied and depending on airline and childrens’ ages, this could cause issues.  

You need to contact the airline and see what their policies are.  I would not necessarily trust any notes put in your file, so make sure you have signed/notarized letters stating both parents approve of children flying alone and just with father.

Personally, we have flown to Europe more than once with only one parent on the flight and other parent on a separate flight without issue or need for documentation, but YMMV.

Liechtenstein is ... there's really nothing there except to say you've been in Liechtenstein. I mean, it's very pretty, but there's nothing there that really makes it worth the faff getting there.

As others have said, you can quite happily bimble around Switzerland for two weeks with no problem, but a low-fuss way of seeing a bit of somewhere else might be to fly in/out of somewhere else and take a scenic train journey into Switzerland (which also expands your options for flights). My first choices there would be Munich or Milan, both with direct trains into CH through the Arlberg and Gotthard passes respectively.

Paris also has direct high-speed rail connections to CH; the route isn't as scenic but it's not unpleasant and if you're fancying Paris anyway it's an option.",3,2025-04-03 01:44:22,Brickie78

Bosnia and Herzegovina is one of my favourite countries and is perfectly safe.

If you have the budget you can get a very reasonably priced private tour from Dubrovnik through various stops to Mostar (and I can recommend who we went with if it interests you). There are also plenty of return day tours to Mostar.

If not there are a few buses a day to Mostar from Dubrovnik for pretty cheap.

For Montenegro Kotor is definitely a highlight and also probably the only place you have time to get to.

Some friends and I once rented a car in Dubrovnik and drove to Mostar for a small day trip, then ended in Kotor and spent a full day there and drove back the third day- it’s not really worth doing for less than that time. I would recommend just picking one spot for a 1-2 day side excursion, and I cant recommend Montegro enough. Beautiful, great food, lots of spots to choose from on the bay of Kotor or in the mountains- but I think Kotor is a great starting spot.",4,2025-04-01 12:50:56,JcAverbuch
travel,1jos4of,mkvosgc,"I did this 3 years ago with my family.  We were in Dubrovnik for a week, and we did day trips to Montenegro and Bosnia.  We hired a driver to pick us up at our AirBnB and drive us both ways for both trips.  He was not a 'tour guide', so he didn't accompany us around the towns, but that was better for us as we preferred to explore on our own.  

For Montenegro, we drove to the Bay of Kotor.  I don't remember for sure, but it was at least 90 minutes or 2 hours to get there (the issue was waiting in line to cross the border).  We stopped near the Kamenari Ferry in the Bay for some coffee and a bite to eat around 930am, and then hopped on this little car ferry that crosses the narrowest part of the bay, and then drove from there along the bay to the town of Kotor.

The town is surrounded by an old wall at the base of a mountain.  It's compact and super easy to explore.  There is an old wall that you can climb that leads up the mountain to an old Church, some ruins, and an AMAZING view of the bay and mountains. 

We hired a speedboat at a dock outside the town walls to take us around the bay.  This was amazing, the bay is 100% surrounded by beautiful black mountains, we stopped at  a small man-made island in the bay, and also at a small town called Perast to explore.  We took the boat back to Kotor and linked up with our driver to head back to Dubrovnik around 330pm and were back in Dubrovnik a couple of hours later.  The ride back over the mountains overlooking the Bay was beautiful.  


Overall we loved this day trip as did our kids.  The scenery was beautiful.  I have never been in a setting like this with the bay, mountains, walled town etc.  


A couple of days later we did the same thing for Bosnia.  This was a longer ride than Montenegro, I think at least 2.5 hours or close to 3 to get there, again the main delay was crossing the border.  It was one lane for the cars and only one guy sitting there checking passports.  (Coming back was quicker, we took a different way that didn't have much of a line, and a few more booths for passport control).  

Our main stop was Mostar.  But we stopped along the way at Počitelj to climb the stairs to the old fortress overlooking the river valley.  We spent maybe 90 minutes there and then moved on to Mostar.  

Mostar is pretty compact, you can see the main parts pretty quickly.  It has a famous bridge and some really good, inexpensive restaurants along the river with views of the bridge.  By the time we got there, we were hungry and the driver gave us an excellent recommendation for a restaurant that was cheap, really good and had a great view.

We loved Mostar because it's predominantly Muslim, so it was really neat to be in Europe and see mosques rather than churches.  One was open to visitors/tourists, so we were able to go in and also climb the minaret for a great view.  

There are a lot of buildings still standing that are either destroyed, or showing a lot of damage from the war that took place in the 1990s.  It's something really good to see and remember that this didn't really take place that long ago and most of the people were alive and experienced it.  


I found the driver as a recommendation in one of Rick Steves' books.  

If you need any info or want to see some pics, please DM me and I'll be happy to send some across.  We loved both trips, and if we go back to Dubrovnik again, we would definitely do one or both again.",3,2025-04-01 16:37:44,juice06870

travel,1jlhcnj,mk3pntc,"Hiking. Just go with a guide. I did Pedra do Telégrafo with someone from Airbnb experiences. IDT it's safe enough to do hikes alone like some of us did in the past. Better to go with someone who knows the trail and the area. My favorite is Doris irmãos but you have to go through a favela called Vidigal. Definitely go with a guide. It's become a pretty well-known excursion in Rio so I think it should be fine. Pedra Bonita is a fairly short and easy hike with stunning views. Pedra da Gávea is harder and gives you similar views. 

You can't miss a sunrise on Copacabana Beach. It would be great to stay in an Airbnb or hotel right on the beach for a night or 2 just to avoid being out there. I did it many years ago but the situation was different and I went with several people. Sunset is a must on Arpoador Beach. 

I love the Forte de Copacabana. A little snack in the Colombo cafe in the afternoon is great after walking through the fort. There's a Confeitaria Colombo in Centro that you should go to but go early bc it can get soooo crowded. You'll find the Convento de Santo Antônio nearby. You can't miss it, it's white and perched on a small hill. It's incredible. The Real Gabinete Português de Leitura is also gorgeous. You'll find the Bonde de Santa Teresa station nearby and I suggest you take it and wander around the central area of Santa Teresa. Safety in the periphery seems to have declined a lot since I lived there as a student about 9 years ago but the center was still lively when I strolled around 2 years ago. If you make it to Santa Teresa you must go to Cultivar and get an açaí com granola and an order of pão. It's the best imo. 

I know it's touristy but you can't miss Cristo Redentor on a clear day. Take the little train. Idk if they still have the vans but they drove like maniacs. Pão de Açúcar is also a great spot but dedicate lots of time to it and stay for the sunset. The Jardim Botânico is really pretty and worth it imo, especially in the morning. 

I also loved going all the way to Leme which is at the end of Copacabana Beach and you can go up to the Forte Duque de Caxias. Look for the military guards who will be by the gates. You walk through a tiny park, moving away from the beach. It's a short, humid and steep hike but the views were amazing and you might see various monkeys. 

The best day trip starts by taking a ferry by Praça XV to Niterói. You can take the bus or an Uber and visit the MAC or the Forte de Santa Cruz. Amazing views of Rio. There's a big park that's great for sunset in Niterói but I haven't been. 

Another day trip would be to Petrópolis, the imperial city. In the past I've taken buses to and from the Novo Rio rodoviária. The ride is so scenic and you can walk around Petrópolis and visit the palace. 

Don't wear jewelry and don't flash your valuables. Theft can be very silent and sudden. Just be careful and you should be fine. If something feels weird or there's an empty street then turn around. If you take the metro or buses then make sure to wear your backpack in the front. I do this regardless but I'm paranoid. If you're a woman taking the metro during rush hour then go into the female only cars. Double check all of this bc things likely changed a bit since I was there as a student and a tourist.",33,2025-03-28 00:21:41,RepublicAltruistic68

Christ the Redeemer and Sugarloaf are both touristy but worthwhile. Try and get there as early as you can for both to miss the massive tour groups.

He wanted to do detours to take me to see things like a dam, etc on the way, and asked me questions about myself and if I had a boyfriend so I had to make one up.

Adding some of southern India to that could extend your trip quite easily and extend out a few weeks. 

We are actually planning 4 months of travel with our family of 3 for next year (read: we travel slower with a young kid than we did pre-kiddo). But a huge criteria for us is visiting a place that you couldn’t really see fully with a 2-3 week vacay. Something to consider for your plans since it’s a unique opportunity. And if you deem that being important, India would fit in well since it takes time to explore there. 

Another couple of areas to look that fit your criteria would be something like a Tanzania, Uganda/Rwanda, Kenya combo. Tonnnnssss of nature and culture. You could add Kili, scuba diving at Mafia island, gorilla and chimp trekking, or Mt Meru for a physical element. 

South Africa and Namibia are rather incredible places as well (and can add Vic Falls) that you can easily spend 4-5 weeks in. Cradle of Humanity is a wonder for the ancient element, it’s pretty easy to manage being self-supported if you do some homework and there’s lots of nature/hiking.

travel,1k3msnt,mo38vr0,Those are all easy trips from each other. I don’t know why you would move hotels. I would pick one place for your base (Gimmelwald or Wangen) and just day trip from there.,36,2025-04-20 13:47:13,MTSlam
travel,1k3msnt,mo3c8bz,"We spent two weeks in Switzerland in fall of 2023. The places we stayed were: Lenzerheide (we are mountain bikers and there's a lot of trail access there); Hospental (a stop over between the train from Chur and Zermatt); Zermatt; Brienz; Zurich (fly out). We had three full days of biking in Lenzerheide; a full day in Zermatt to hike; and four full days in Grindelwald/Lauterbrunnen to hike. When you are in the Berner Oberland you can get anywhere very quickly and easily. For instance, if you want to spend the day in Lauterbrunnen and Murrin or Wengen you can take the gondola out of the central Grindelwald station and up to Mannlechin and then hike down or take lift down to Lauterbrunnen. We hiked. Then you can explore that valley and either take the train back or take the lifts back. If you have the Berner Oberland or Jungfrau pass you can get free/discounts so its worth it if you are doing a lot of trips in the area. Boats are included in this so if you want to cross Interlaken (which we did) the fare is either included or reduced. When in Grindelwald, if you want to go up to Jungfraujoch make sure you plan ahead as tickets sell out on the train up to the summit. You'll take the 3S lift out of the central Grindelwald station and then transfer to the train. its really cool up there but make sure you are ok with altitude.

If you really just want to see all those places so be it. Rush a bit and see it if it's once in a lifetime.

HOWEVER.

Unless Switzerland is super high on your wishlist time and money to move around won't make up the difference in flight cost if you research patiently. Include it if it's a top 3 kinda thing, stay closer to France and the UK if it's purely a matter of flight cost.

If you keep your countries as-is I'd cut Carcassonne out for more time in either Paris or Switzerland.

It's easy to underestimate the soft time cost of little side trips especially when you're not doing it in a favorable order.

It's also pretty easy to use extra time in a single base to do the day trip spontaneously anyway if you decide you can and want to. 

Trust me when I say rushed travel can be done properly (I've done it) and improperly (also done it) and this is improper.

travel,1jyyop1,mn45gi6,"To add a little to what others have said: at the very least, I’d recommend starting in Switzerland and working from there through France, the UK, and Ireland, so at least you’re mostly travelling in a line. I understand that you have a personal reason to visit Dublin - but it feels very out of place on this trip. Doing the UK and Ireland makes sense; doing London and Paris (debatably even London, France, and Switzerland - or as an alternative London, Paris, Brussels, and Amsterdam) would also make sense. 

I know you’ve said below that you’re not keen on anywhere in the UK besides London, that you have your heart set on Carcasonne and the Swiss countryside, and you’re visiting a friend in Dublin. Five days per place may actually be alright, but the order and transport links between them will mean you lose quite a bit of time. An additional pro for trains is that you can actually see the countryside if you’re travelling during the day. I’ve never been to Switzerland, so I can’t vouch for it specifically, but I’ve been to the other places on your list, as well as almost everywhere else mentioned in comments from others; I think deciding on if your priority is Switzerland or Dublin will help you with planning. Would meeting your friend in a different city (like London) be an option?

Edit: just noticed you mention in another comment that your friend will likely be with you in London. Honestly, while Dublin is a fine enough city, I’d actually recommend cutting from your itinerary, purely because it doesn’t make much sense logistically. London - Paris - south of France (I’d lean Lyon; you could also make an intermediate stop in Strasbourg) - Switzerland does actually make sense, and can be done by rail.",3,2025-04-14 19:43:20,Tartanman97

travel,1jyyop1,mn2bu3y,"It's not a great itinerary in regards to making most of the time you have for your trip. You have to figure that on the days that you're traveling from London to Dublin and then from Dublin to Carcassone, you're going to lose most of those days on just traveling (getting to the airport, waiting for your flight, the flight and then getting from the airport). My first recommendation would be to focus your trip on continental Europe so that you aren't sacrificing nearly three full days just on just getting to and from three cities. 

As far as the amount of time you plan in each location, again it's not a great use of your time. I generally plan on two to three nights in each individual city I visit (the exception was when I visited Kyoto because I knew in advance what I planned to do there), which generally gives me enough time to cover the major sites and a museum or two. I'm assuming that you are going to use these cities as a base and plan to explore some areas outside of the city but I'd rather actually limit the amount of time in the larger cities and plan on several days/nights in smaller cities and towns.

You also are doing a lot of back and forth on your planned itinerary, which is going to waste more time. Try to line up your cities so that you're not back tracking.

travel,1jn7zw1,mkipltg,"The Galapagos are a small archipelago, while Patagonia is a huge region, so you’ll first need to know what you want to see in Patagonia (covering everything isn’t possible with limited time)

In Patagonia you have the northernmost region which includes Bariloche, San Martin de los Andes and the 7 Lakes Route (a car is needed). This is a beautiful area with ski resorts, European style architecture, mountains, lakes and forests. Crossing into Chile is also a beautiful drive.

Then you have the most distant Patagonia, which is more isolated and even more stunning. El Chalten is Argentina’s trekking capital, El Calafate has arguably Latin America’s most famous glaciers, and Torres del Paine in Chile offers spectacular nature and trekking too. Ushuaia is also nice but most people go there to take Antarctic cruises and/or see the Southern Lights. Puerto Madryn is one of the world’s best locations for whale watching

Remember that Patagonia is expensive, you’ll need expensive flights to connect distant destinations (eg Bariloche to El Calafate or to Ushuaia)

Good plan!

> Also, would you recommend staying in a central location like Malaga and do day trips to nearby cities (less hotel hopping)

It could be a good idea, if your kids don't mind being in a car too much. But I wouldn't go for Málaga. Just yesterday I was talking to someone from Málaga and he spent the whole lunch saying how Málaga has changed a lot since he was a boy, and Córdoba is his favourite place in Spain. He's not wrong; I'd recommend you stay in Granada or Córdoba, both much nicer than Málaga. Málaga is a more typical Spanish city, you'll get a lot of that in Madrid and Barcelona.

> We are interested in beautiful scenery, unique/picturesque towns, some beach activity (not a lot though), and moorish architecture. Not interested in big museums or art galleries.

Some recs:

- For beautiful scenery, see el **Caminito del Rey**. Kids under 8 can't do it but yours should be old enough for it. Don't try to rush through it though, make it a day trip. Or el **torcal de antequera** as an alternative.

- **Observatorio de Sierra Nevada**: If you have kids who get bored with history, you can try something different like visiting the observatory. They only do a few visits in July and August so [check the dates](https://www.osn.iaa.csic.es/en/general/guided-visit). Not sure if the tours are in English too, might want to ask. You can combine this with some sort of astronomy tour somewhere in the cities you're visiting (there were many important astronomers in Al-Ándalus during the Islamic Golden Age, many living in Sevilla or Granada, such as Jabir ibn Aflah who invented the torquetum). I'm not sure if they do guided themed tours like that around the cities, but worth a look. If not, I'm sure they do other themed tours that the kids might enjoy.

- Unique/picturesque towns: **Setenil de las Bodegas**, **Alhama de Granada**, **Guadix** (for cave-houses). There are also endless **pueblos blancos** (white towns) in Andalucía, ex. Algatocín, Casares, Gaucín, etc.

- For Moorish architecture, if you're really into it, see **Madinat al-Zahra** when in Córdoba. It's mostly ruins so might not be so interesting to you and may not be worth the detour if you have just a passing interest in architecture. But my history teacher loves it and recommended it as a must-visit if we were in the area (for history fans, that is).

- For the **beach**, it's better to save it for when in Barcelona. In my humble opinion, the beach at Barcelona is disgusting and I'm really not sure why people enjoy it. If you're into it, take an early-ish train (it takes 1.5-2h, and late trains are common, so better get on a train before 9am) from Barcelona to **Tarragona** and make it a day trip. The train ride goes along the coast so you get great sea views. In Tarragona they do have a good long beach and also lots of Roman ruins (it's UNESCO), so you can have a walk around town after the swim. Another Barcelona day trip is **Montserrat**.",5,2025-04-12 12:16:21,NotACaterpillar

Granada, Madrid and Seville were definitely highlights and I'd love to go back. I'd happily skip Malaga next time, we ran into more Brits than locals.

seville 3 nights - need 3 nights minimum, I felt like even then there were things we didn't have time for

cordoba day trip (on the way from seville to granada) - obviously felt very rushed but I'm happy we didn't take time from seville/granada. I imagine the city would feel very different overnight once the day trippers leave.

granada 3 nights - one of our favourite cities in europe, id recommend staying in the Albaicin for views of the alhambra

malaga 3 nights - spent 1 day in malaga, 1 day trip to Ronda and 1 day trip to do the el caminito del rey. I would only stay here as a base for day trips. Good seafood, otherwise the food in granada/madrid/seville is so much better with less tourist traps. So many tourists walking around. Felt pretty underwhelming after coming from Granada.

travel,1jox5ek,mky9xzn,">At least a few in proper yurt encampments

Staying in a Ger is more of a Kazakh thing - so a ""proper"" (authentic, nomadic, belonging to a family) yurt encampment is best experienced in the sparsely populated western regions of Mongolia. 

Inner Mongolia has a big domestic tourism industry so think most yurt places you will find will be geared up for Chinese tourists wanting to cosplay as Mongolian, and will be fixed in place and very touristy. Not saying nomadic ones don't exist, but will probably be harder to find, or hard to find a guide who is able to take you (Chinese domestic tourists don't really crave authenticity so tours aren't set up for it). There are encampments along the Kubuqi desert, but I know a lot of them are big tourist things.

And also not saying the tourist stuff won't be fun - gers are cool - but if you're trying to do a photo project it might not be what you're after. Unless you want to take the Chinese tourism angle which is interesting in its own right.

I've only really been to the area around Hohhot, but it's an interesting part of the world. Try and find a Mongolian guide rather than a Han Chinese guide if you want to get more accurate info.",5,2025-04-02 01:03:04,mcwobby
travel,1jox5ek,mkyz3ta,"Hi! Your trip sounds absolutely amazing – and not at all offensive, don’t worry. You’re clearly being thoughtful and respectful, and that’s what matters most. I think you’re going to love Inner Mongolia – it’s full of breathtaking landscapes, rich culture, and warm hospitality.

Don’t worry about getting bored – 5–6 days in the grasslands is definitely not too long, especially with your plans to ride, hike, cook, meet people, and take photos. The scenery changes a lot depending on where you go, and there’s always something new to experience. You might even wish you had more time!

For staying in the wild or in traditional yurt camps, you can absolutely arrange some of it in advance. Apps like Xiecheng (Ctrip) for travel planning and transport, Meituan for food and general services, and Rednote (Xiaohongshu) for lifestyle content and local tips can be really useful. Many people share their itineraries and even contact info for reliable local drivers or small group tours. These apps are mostly in Chinese, but your boyfriend should be able to help with that.

Yes, some travelers do just find a driver after landing, but if you prefer certainty (understandably!), it’s worth booking in advance – try Rednote for real user recommendations, and WeChat groups too if you can get in. Look for drivers familiar with the Hulunbuir region – some are used to working with visitors and can help you stay in authentic yurt camps and even introduce you to local families.

travel,1jmbdxz,mkau7bf,"15 to 20 lbs is on the light side, but a common weight limit with Taiwan's China Airlines and the three China-based airlines - Air China, China Southern, and China Eastern.  Most American airlines have carry-on size restrictions and the only weight restriction is that you are able to lift it up into the overhead compartment; e.g. I hate check-in luggage and I have often traveled with no issues just bringing on a small backpack, a camera holster, and a densely-packed carry-on weighing 40-50 lbs when flying inside U.S. and throughout Africa.

China Airlines states the 15-lb carry-on weight limit on their website:

[https://www.china-airlines.com/us/en/fly/prepare-for-the-fly/baggage/carry-on-baggage](https://www.china-airlines.com/us/en/fly/prepare-for-the-fly/baggage/carry-on-baggage)

But whether the airline actually weighs your carry-on and enforces the weight limit is what REALLY matters, and that highly varies from airline to airline, and can even vary depending upon which ticket agent you walk up to.

China Airlines has never weighed my carry-on.  South African Airways also states a 18-lb carry-on limit (8 kg), but they have never weighed my carry-on since 2006 when I first started flying on SAA, and I have carried a 50-lb carry-on aboard for 2-month African trips flying from New York to Cape Town.  On the other hand, I have had my carry-on often weighed by China Southern and China Eastern since 1998 and both China Southern and China Eastern ticket agents have told me before that I had to lighten my carry-on, so I had to transfer some items from my carry-on to my wife's carry-on and check-in luggage.

The really weird and nonsensical aspect of the airlines weighing the carry-on and enforcing weight limits is that you can usually pick out the heaviest items from your carry-on and put them inside a purse or (in my situations) my backpack ""personal item"" that I stow under the seat and the ticket agents are okay with that lmao; i.e. the carry-on weight limit does not cover the TOTAL weight of ALL items that you are bringing on board the plane, but just what is on one carry-on (or the two carry-ons that some Business Class tickets allow) and I have NEVER had my backpack ""personal item"" weighed, nor do they ever weigh my wife's handbag.",2,2025-03-29 03:10:59,KrunchyPhrog

travel,1k4k2os,moamj46,"Hey man, just arrived back from a short 6 day trip walking a part of the Camino.

I cannot recommend it enough and while I was travelled with my dad, most others I met on the trail were solo travellers. IMO a perfect holiday for a solo back packer.

There are tons of websites providing route recommendations including difficulty of the walking, distance, where to stay,place to see and eat. I highly recommend https://caminoways.com which has a planner you can use.

The beginning of the Camino actually begins in France. You'd need to fly into Biarritz and then walk over the Pyrenees before heading towards Pamplona.

I am to do this part myself later this year.

Our trip was different had we only had a few days so we flew to Bilbao and then took a bus to Los Arcos. We then talked to Sansol, Viana, Lagrono and then headed to Haro.

The views, the hotels, the food were amazing and I cannot recommend it enough.

It's such a great experience and you can pick and choose your starting/ending point to suit your needs.

Best of luck.",6,2025-04-21 18:13:31,emale27

travel,1k4k2os,moh4pwm,"Hi! Spain and Portugal are very safe for solo travelers, so you should not have any issues in terms of safety. And, while it can happen anywhere of course, the trans community is welcomed in both countries so the chances of being treated differently are relatively low compared to other destinations. 

I lived in Portugal (Peniche/Lisbon) for 3 years and now been living in Spain (Barcelona), so I know both pretty well.  
If you prefer exploring smaller, quaint towns off the beaten path I'd definitely stick to the north of both countries -- the Algarve and south regions in Portugal and all of southern Spain are known for their tourism, so you'd likely find big crowds in most places.

I'm partial to places like Guimaraes and Braga in Portugal, which see a lot of local tourism but not that many international travelers. Same goes for the north of Spain -- if you got the time and want to do a big chunk El Camino, I would recommend leaving from Bilbao, but it takes about a month to do the trail from that far out. Other amazing cities you can visit and then start the trekkng El Camino from are Gijon (15 days more or less), Lugo (7 days), and La Coruña (my personal fave in terms of city, 5 days).

travel,1jlqm0x,mk5odi4,"Seoul is a larger and more hi-tech city than Taipei (e.g. it has its own navigation app ecosystem, which includes live information about buses, subways etc. and even the timing of traffic lights if you're driving). There is some great hiking within city limits in both cities: Taipei has the ""Taipei Grand Trail"" around the perimeter of the whole city (it is surrounded by mountains on most sides), you can even get a physical map at the city's trail planning office. It also has Yangmingshan National Park. Seoul has Bukhansan National Park.

I love the bikesharing system in Taipei (YouBike) and it extends even into some popular neighboring tourist spots (e.g. between Houtong, the ""cat village"" and Ruifang). Taipei's easycard is also pretty convenient, you can use it for youbikes, payment in stores, public transportation etc.

In Seoul, Cheonggyecheon was a great little nature spot in the middle of the city. It's a stream that was covered up to build a huge elevated highway cutting through the city, but in the early 00's, they turned it back into something of a park where you can walk alongside a stream for miles. It's where I would run when I stayed in Seoul. Another thing we did that was great is walking around the Old City Wall, Hanyan Doseong. Obviously it's not the original wall, it had to be rebuilt and refurbished a lot since it was first built in the late 14th century and some sections are missing, but it's still super interesting imho. It's a good 6-hour walk if you stop a few times, but not for very long (it's close to 25 km IIRC). You can also get a certificate and a badge if you take pics at the 4 or 5 (can't recall) pre-defined spots and then go to this little office at their museum and show them your registration number or whatever after uploading the pics to their website first. The badge is cute and they have different colors for each season and if you do it in all 4 seasons, you get a fancy metal-colored one.

Overall, I find Taiwan to be better for (impressive) nature. The central mountain region is absolutely stunning as is the east coast between Hualien and Yilan on a nice day. Sadly Taroko Gorge will take a while to re-open I think (it was severely damaged by the earthquake).

Foodwise, I prefer Korea, but night markets in Taipei are fun. Raohe is my favorite. Every time I've been there I stayed the next street over. I would run along the Keelung river - the riverside parks all around Taipei are fantastic - and pick up something to eat at the market on my way home.

I have a bit of a love affair with Taiwan, though. Can't really tell you why. It's a pretty unique place, it never gets very cold (I'm no bothered by oppressive heat), I love the mountains, I love the spas in Beitou (reachable by subway). And in some ways it's like ""Japan meets China"". I like Taipei and Hualien most. Lots of fun spots reachable by train from Taipei in the north, including hikes and bike rides (e.g. look up ""Old Caoling Tunnel"" - you can rent bicycles outside the train station, pick up a bento box and go on a 20-something km loop that takes you through some countryside then out onto the coast via an old railway tunnel turned bike-and-pedestrian tunnel). Lots of serene nature near Hualien. Kaohsiung is probably my third preference. It has subway lines and trams and Shoushan is a nice way to spend half a day watching the stupid monkeys and walking around different areas of the hill. Tainan has great food, but its public transportation is lacking, it's a bit sprawling for me and the mountains are too far. I have somehow not spent any time in Taichung and only passed through Chiayi so I can't speak to those places. Alishan is also worth it and if you like higher mountains and hiking, you can also do Yushan, ideally in 2 days, but it takes some planning, because you need to book permits and spots at the lodge.

Oh yeah, the people. By and large polite and helpful in both places, but pretty closed off in both places. I feel like the Taiwanese are a bit more open though. And Taiwan has fewer grumpy grandmas.

One last thing I just remembered, pollution. It can get pretty bad in Seoul, especially in winter and early spring. Summer and early fall should be OK I think. Taipei doesn't have this issue most of the time, but OTOH it's really cloudy usually. Hualien being on the other side from China and also being a small city has none of these pollution problems. Tainan and Kaohsiung can get some pretty nasty pollution both blown over from China and from domestic industry. As far as weather, summer and early fall is typhoon season in Taiwan, so a multi-day typhoon, while not likely, is entirely possible. This means staying inside on those days if it hits Taiwan head-on. But overall I think early fall is a great time to go to either place.",42,2025-03-28 09:36:13,hungariannastyboy

I love the food, of course, but also the ease of getting around, not just within Taipei or other cities, but also between cities. Kaohsiung is an amazing second city with an outstanding art and architecture scene, and Tainan is worth visiting for its food, history and parks as well. Taiwan also has some incredible natural attractions outside of the main cities, such as Alishan National Forest and Taroko Gorge, although much of the latter is now closed due to the 2024 earthquake. If you love Japan, I think you’ll love Taiwan too as there are many aspects, such as orderliness and politeness, that are similar, while you’ll otherwise find yourself immersed in the Taiwanese/Chinese culinary and cultural experience.

Digitalise everything (social security, insurance, etc) -

Get travel insurance -
Get international/Japanese driver license -

travel,1k2etpq,mntmny8,"I’ve never been to Brazil but I was in Panama City last year and also visited the canal. 4-5 days seems to fit your schedule better but there’s not too much to see nor will it be anything crazy. It’s a really chill place. I’d recommend staying in casca viejo where a lot of the nightlife is and everywhere should be accessible by foot (if not uber is SO cheap there). 

Although I will say Panama felt extremely safe (as a guy) and I was never worried about walking around by myself day or night. The nightlife is pretty good (check out Selina in Casio viejo if you go, it’s a rooftop bar on top of a hostel with many internationals and you can see the whole city skyline). There’s also Cielo another rooftop bar and there’s a zip line in that same building too (37th floor I think) if you’re into that. 

You can visit the fish market and haggle with ppl for the cheapest meal (they basically all sell the same thing but the seafood is bomb, esp the ceviche). You can also book some catamaran cruises and meet a lot of locals and foreigners on vacation too (also how I met people), like the one that goes to Taboga island (they also anchor so you can swim/snorkel, sun bathe). Also check out Cantina Del Tigre it’s a sick restaurant and there’s food/drinks are bomb (best on my trip).

Also the coffee is amazing (check out the geisha coffee - you’ll be wanting to bring as many packs home if you like coffee) - check out UNIDO & Sisu coffee (best breakfast sandwich ever @ UNIDO)

If you have friends to show you around in Brazil tho they can def maximize your time and make sure you don’t step foot in the wrong neighborhood which is a big advantage, so if that’s an option I’d do that although I still don’t think you’ll see all of Brazil in 4-5 days whereas that is enough time for Panama.",11,2025-04-18 20:53:53,Airgelo

rio was the most fun of the three by a fair margin, but you are seriously planning on flying from (presumably) the united states all the way to rio or SP with just 4 days? depending on where you are located, you’d probably connect in bogota or panama city (4ish hour flight from miami or houston), plus another 6-7 hours down to southern brazil.",5,2025-04-18 21:26:33,glwillia

Agree with most comments, skip both cities and come to Ghent.

I love this city, food and drink-wise it has a lot to offer. Cheaper, safer and much better vibe than both Brussels and Paris. The city is quite walkable and public transportation is decent, Uber is available as well.

If you land in Brussels-Zaventem (DO NOT LAND IN BRUSSELS-CHARLEROI, THERE IS NOTHING THERE AND NOT CONVENIENT TO GET OUT OF), the train station is below the airport and, while pricy, is super convenient to get anywhere in Belgium, will take you about an hour to get to either Bruges, Ghent or Antwerp.

travel,1jwp0kt,mmk2dbj,"Hi, I’ve only been to northern Argentina so I’ll give you a few tips on that. Salta city is well worth a day, the historic center is beautiful and has really nice churches, make sure to visit the mummies! Driving is not necessary for the city itself, you can walk. At night go to La Casona del Molino to experience a true northern peña, but make a reservation because it’s popular among tourists and it fills quick.

Right behind Cerro de los Siete Colores in Purmamarca you have “el Paseo de los Colorados” which is a circular short walk that takes very little time and has wonderful views.

There’s a MAJOR spot missing from your itinerary: Serranía del Hornocal / Cerro de los 14 Colores is a massive and beautiful mountain, which you should def visit. A regular rental car won’t be good to drive that road, so you need to either rent a 4x4 or pay for an excursion there. At sunset it truly is magical, don’t miss this.

The Quebrada de las Señoritas is a nice hike with “Martian” red landscapes all around you, that departs from the tiny town of Uquía and takes 2-3 hours.

The drive from Purmamarca to Salinas Grandes is beautiful on itself, make sure to make all the necessary stops.

The drive from Salta to Cachi goes through the famous Cuesta del Obispo which is beautiful, do this during the day and with a clear day, you’ll love the views. Make sure to stop at panoramic spots.

You can visit the Cuevas de Acsibi from a town near Cachi, you’ll need to pay for a private tour that takes you there (it’s private property) and you can get it done in 3-4 hours usually.

The road connecting Cachi and Cafayate is in horrendous condition, do NOT take your rental car there unless it’s a solid 4x4. The Quebrada de las Flechas is a beautiful natural spot in the middle of this road, it has an amazing panoramic stop, but it can destroy any regular car. Renting an excursion is also a good idea.

In Cafayate there are 2 major beautiful wineries that require reservation: Piattelli and El Esteco. In my opinion San Pedro de Yacochuya right next door is just as nice. You can do all 3 in a day if you want. Make sure to drive the Quebrada de las Conchas road and make all the necessary stops, it’s a breathtaking route, you’ll feel you’re visiting another planet at some spots. The small restaurant Milla7 on the highway is fantastic, great food and views but it fills up quick.

Most tourists never make it to Tucuman province, but from Cafayate you can also do a day trip to Tafí del Valle which is a beautiful valley town in a nearby province. I did horseback riding to see the views, it was absolutely worth it.

We went to Atacama first. It was a great place to visit too. Rented a car and visited Moon valley, Miscanti lagoon and beyond.

travel,1jwp0kt,mmn2j12,"You shouldn't miss the Uyuni tour. It has some of the best landscapes in South America. I'd say cut a bit of the northern Argentina stuff so that the itinerary works. Can't advice you on what as I haven't done most of that.

San Pedro, I'd say 2 full days for tours is enough since some of the stuff there is similar as things you see on the Uyuni tour. Staying in San Pedro also helps with altitude acclimatization.

The Uyuni tour one way San Pedro-Uyuni is 3 days 2 nights, shared tour costs around $200 and includes everything. I've also been end of April, most of the salar is dry (looks a bit like snow but it's so huge it's still very impressive as it's all you see) but the guide knew where to find water to see the mirror effect at sunset which looked magical.

From Uyuni there are morning flights to La Paz (also night buses but you'd prefer the flights as I understand). So do that the day after you arrive. You can explore La Paz for the rest of the day (use the cable cars to get around, they also have great views).

I think there are some direct buses from La Paz to Cusco but they take like 15 hours, so if the schedule allows it I'd spend some time at Lake Titicaca in between. I prefer the Bolivian side, from Copacabana you can take a boat to Isla del Sol which is a cool hike if you have like a full day to spend there. 

I guess cut Arequipa (or add it after your time in the Cusco area if you still have time).",1,2025-04-11 22:22:32,FunSeaworthiness709

Especially in Es Trenc we could drive up and park close to the beach while the car park was packed and a little further away. Depending on how long you want to stay there pack water and some lunch as there wasn't too many restaurants nearby. 


In the west you can drive to Valdemossa and then to the coast or venture further North to Formentor (we were glad we had the vespa on those narrow roads).
 
If you don't want to drive all the time the popular tour by old train to Soller, tram to Port de Sóller and boat to Sa Callobra was fun too. Touristy and can get crowded but we were lucky with little to no crowds and really enjoyed it.


No matter what you plan, I'm sure you're gonna have a wonderful stay in Mallorca!

travel,1jtkpsj,mlvt2u4,"I did this trip a few years ago- we rented a car in Tirana and spent 2 nights in Dhermi and 4 in Ksamil. Our focus was the beach. One thing I didn't anticipate was how long it takes to get anywhere- the drive along the coast was significantly slower than what Google maps predicted. It's a stunning drive, though.

One night in Tirana feels right- there are enough interesting sites, and I might have appreciated not making the drive to Dhermi in the dark. The Vlore pass is kind of wild in a dinky rental car. 

I liked Dhermi- it's a cute little beach town that feels really secluded and has amazing views. I'm not sure if you will still be able to get a boat from Dhermi to Gjirokaster, but it's an ""easy"" drive from Dhermi and the hike is nowhere near as bad as web sites lead you to believe. It's worth it. 

Ksamil was a great spot for beach and access to Butrint and the surrounding area. There is decently good tourist infrastructure. We did a day trip on a small boat, visited Butrint, and generally relaxed. 

From there we drove to Saranda to drop off our rental car and hop on a jenky ferry to Corfu. I'm glad we didn't spend time in Saranda, but the British teenagers on our Ksamil boat trip enjoyed the clubs there. 

We didn't explore too much of the interior of the country, but we did transfer from Skopje by way of Ohrid to Tirana, so we got a good sense of the mountains then.

On one hand, there are definitely more tourists now than 40 years ago. I think overtourism has ruined the feel of many places and I wholeheartedly agree that places around the world are becoming less ""authentic"" and looking more and more similar by the year. Hotel rooms look pretty much the same everywhere. And I think this will only get worse.

However, it's also true that crowds are very predictable and thus can be avoided at many (if not most) sites. I'm less familiar with Prague, but you also mention Barcelona as an example. La Sagrada Família is double more crowded at 2pm this week than it was at 2pm last Thursday. Tourists travel by season. And it's not full of people around 9am, most arrive by 11am. People come to Spain and see the popular sites in BCN, Madrid, Toledo, Sevilla... and then leave. The hundreds (thousands?) of other towns and cities that exist in Spain are far from crowded with tourists. It's very easy to have an authentic Spanish experience and have sites to yourself. 

People talk about how crowded Japan is these days, and I agree. But I'm still by myself at 80% of the places I visit. I recently came back from Venice... where it seemed everyone was walking the same few streets and visiting the same 3 museums. The rest of the city was very quiet.

Back in the mid 1990s, there were far fewer tourists in Europe compared to today, so it was far easier to visit many of the major tourist attractions.I visited the Roman Forum. I was able to walk freely everywhere. The last time I was in Rome, many parts of the Roman Forum were roped off and you had to queue to get access to them. Back then, I could also walk freely up to a platform (no charge) in the Coliseum to get a really good view of the inside. Now you need to pay to get beyond the outside gates. The Champs Elysee in Paris was a far more pleasant experience back then than it is today. Access to major museums like The Vatican Museum, The Louvre, The Uffizi Gallery, the Prado Museum, etc. was just a matter of queueing for about 30-40 minutes.

I travelled by rail. The Thomas Cook rail timetable book was a godsend and obligatory for co-ordinating schedules. Purchasing long distance rail tickets was a matter of rocking up at the train station a day or two in advance to purchase tickets.

There are not a crazy amount of tourists everywhere, it only seems so if you follow the herd.

Tourism has certainly increased significantly over the years, but it is still easy enough to avoid the tourist crowds if you want to.

Depends on the person, type of trip one makes etc, but for me not fundamentally different other than that technology makes things (research, route finding, communication) a lot easier, with growing older my attitudes and priorities have changed and I make different choices.

People travel more now because it's easier and more affordable, not because it's ""fashion"". A more severe recession would affect travel (and apparently, so many more aspects of life) greatly. Apparently, the future of travel depends on the future of global economy and international affairs.

Influencers only play a tiny role in all of that. The likes of TUI, Expedia etc are the ones who dictate where tourism is headed.

It's absolutely amazing and one of the joys about visiting the country. It goes absolutely everywhere, runs frequently and is easy to use and is flexible. You never need to book standard daytime trains in advance.

It is absolutely no problem when hiking and going to national parks. They are all very well linked with public transport, it really does go almost everywhere you can drive and more. I've found the public transport much more convenient to use. Buses often stop nearer trail heads then you can park. And if you want to go up the mountains then cable cars and narrow gauge trains get you further than the road network. And as you've said some mountain towns are car free and even when not parking is a massive nightmare.

It also means you can be more flexible with your hike. Eg if you want to keep going or come back early just do exactly that from a different spot. Also means you can split up. Rather than all having to return to your car. And it means you can do some great one way hikes and hence see more.

travel,1jpvsvo,ml3h43g,"Looks great!

Personally i don't think you need two nights at Nerja... one is plenty. I'd even just not bother staying over and  just do a stopover at Nerja for a few hours on the way to Malaga. I'd rather add an extra night at Sevilla to do a day trip to Arcos de la Fronterra and Jerez de la Frontera, and just see/eat more of Sevilla. And with the extra day (or two) at Sevilla, you'll have a bit of extra time to explore the white towns of Olvera and Zahara de la Seirra in the vicinity of Setenil de las Bodegas after Ronda.

Just small tweaks based on a fairly recent visit.

Oh! The other thing also is that you may want to consider driving the reverse order somewhat of Malaga>Granada>Cordoba>Sevilla>Malaga. Only because the drive from Sevilla to Malaga was actually quite beautiful... you can see the Rock of Gibraltar in the distance along the way and you go through spectacular landscape somewhat along the Mediterranean and part of it on elevated mountain highways.

Tips - Get your Caminito del Rey entry and parking tickets in advance.  Do the rooftop tour of the Sevilla Cathedral (advanced tickets also needed) which is awesome fun and you get to see impressive vantages and hidden areas that you can't with the regular entry. Just saw you don't have tix for Alhambra (yikes) if you can't get in consider using that time to go to Jaen (north of Malaga) or do a daytrip to Nerja and add the extra time to Sevilla.",1,2025-04-02 21:35:54,GrantTheFixer

Good brew-pub in Tahoe City.

The nicest hotel-casino is North Shore. It will be pretty pricy, but its far better than the usual smoke filled NV casino.

There's a fun hike at Echo Lake on Highway 50 on the crest of the Sierra Nevada range. You can hike around the lake and take the water-taxi back. You'll have to check if this is open yet.

Its a short hike, but when in North Shore, take the hike to Monkey Rock. Its only a mile or so, with some bit of climb. There was a rock which looked a little bit like a monkey. So a local artists embellished it a bit.

On the East side of Emerald Bay you can hike down to Viking's Holm which was an early estate built like a wooden Viking castle.

If you’re outdoorsy and not afraid of some possible snowy mountain driving (if you rent a vehicle), I highly recommend driving up to Lake Tahoe. I truly believe everyone needs to see it at least once if they’re near it. I spent lots of time up there and in the Sierra Nevada. It’s incredibly beautiful and a great place for solitude, but you might run into some people congestion near the ski resorts. Depending on where you’ll be in Reno, it’s a drive that can be made in under an hour. 

Virginia City is also very cool.  Also a little bit of a drive up the mountains but it’s on the eastern side so there’s a good chance you won’t run into snow. There’s an old cemetery, old mines, a cool old schoolhouse you can tour, old bars with original rails, beautiful homes, etc. it looks like a true western town but it can be a bit of a tourist trap.  There’s also Genoa about 45 minutes south of Reno, I believe it was the first settlement in the Nevada Territory. That can be incorporated into a Lake Tahoe trip easily. Minden/Gardnerville are down there too and there’s a very good Basque restaurant there - good place if you’re unfamiliar with the culture. 

Reno itself: Midtown has some cool stuff and good restaurants. Downtown is obviously full of casinos so you’ll have no shortage of gambling and drinking options.  The Eddie in particular is really cool, it’s an outdoor bar with games and other stuff.  Not sure if they’re open yet.

Tucked away in an alleyway right next to the world-famous Livraria Bertrand bookstore, this place was awesome. Inside, this century-old tavern has been turned into a cute, quaint, and cozy hideaway... managing to make you feel far away from the hustle and bustle of the city, and balancing a traditional Portuguese feel with just a few modern touches. There is outdoor seating available, too. The recipes are based on those of one of the owners' grandmother, and the restaurant focusses on using Portuguese products exclusively. Amazing food, wonderful service, great atmosphere, and extremely reasonable prices. I still dream about the shrimp from here.

This was where we went for our last night in Lisbon and I feel like it was the best dining experiences I have ever had. Again, cozy, quaint, romantic atmosphere. Again, tucked away in an alleyway which you could very easily miss if you weren't paying attention. The restaurant is the partnership of a chef and a sommelier, and each are masters of their craft. The food is slightly elevated modern takes on traditional Portuguese dishes. Every single thing we ate or drank here was perfect. For reference, my wife spent years as a bar manager at several mid-high end restaurants and bistros, and I spent years as a photographer and marketing manager for a hospitality group which owned several nice bars and restaurants—so we have been fortunate to have had access to lots of fantastic meals and drinks in the past... but nothing checked all the boxes quite like our experience at Boca D'Uva.

I’m also from BC and ICBC will not do anything here. Get a credit card that covers the CDW and by law, all car rentals in the EU have to cover liability so you have no choice as its baked into the price you pay.

For the last several trips to Europe where I needed a car, I’ve gone through Gemut which is an American consolidator. They have been in business for decades and provide excellent service.

2. Driving is fine. Main highways are very well maintained. Tolls can be paid by credit cards. Don't understand the expensive comment. It's reasonable... don't take back roads unless you have tons of time to spare or have a reason to do so.
3. Look at the terms of your insurance. Likely doesn't cover the excess. You can get cheap car hire insurance before you travel. Sometimes, your credit card offers it. But essentially, you just get a hold on your credit card like normal.
4. Parking in the main cities will be annoying and expensive. But manageable. Just research where you can park. Preebooking parking in secure places can be cheaper.

 warned about speed traps and cameras and made alert sounds if I was speeding. In Europe they seem to be culturally strict that you should be driving in the slow lane unless you’re passing a car. I was in the middle lane of a 3 lands road having a nice drive when a car sped right up on my bunker and honking hysterically and then went around me screaming through the window. I noticed on empty roads that people always moved quickly to the right lane.There was almost NO traffic and I only saw one accident in 9 days (I usually see multiple accidents just on the way to work). 

A minor confusing thing for me were the speed changes meant for exit ramps (but the car would give me alerts for not slowing down, when I wasn’t exiting).

Sligo would be worth the trip as you can visit Yeats' grave and there's also a neolithic cairn that is meant to be the grave of the mythological Irish queen Medb.

I'm not sure, how often this is checked, but I had a warning from German sim provider about my extensive data usage in local roaming / within European Union.

Otherwise, your best bet would be researching prices in cheaperish EU countries (Eastern Block) and find a tariff, which provides the roaming at its full capacity (compared to 20gbs provided by your husband's carrier) and hope for the best, that you won't be annoyed by carriers for misusage.

Alternatively, you could do same in your home country and just get few extra sims for mobile router or as 2nd esim/internet sim in his phone.

Loved every second of it, I think I spent about 4~5 days in Stockholm and explored a lot of the archipelagos, but I may have cut that by 1, even 2 days. Loved my 2 days in Malmö, but it really cut into Copenhagen (loved it, need to return). The overnight ferry to Oslo was really nice, but I see you're heading to Bergen instead; are you going by boat? If not, I highly recommend it. 


The path between Bergen and Oslo was some of the most beautiful landscapes I have ever seen. Both of those cities are well worth exploring, and there are good hikes around Bergen, but you're also going more off the path than I did, which sounds delightful (I plan on returning to Norway only to go further north). I will say that's a very small amount of time to spend in both Bergen and Oslo.

A few years ago, I spent two nights in the Duoro as part of a larger trip.  I took the train from Porto and stayed in Regua at the Hotel Régua Douro, which is across the river from one of the Six Senses resorts that was way out of my budget.

Over those two days and two nights, I was able to see the surprisingly excellent museum in Regua and take the train further into the Duoro up to Pinhao, where I went wine tasting at Quinta do Bomfim.  (Unfortunately, I arrived to late to experience their winery tour.)  I ate and drank very well (and very cheaply at local places) those days.  I would have loved to have an extra night in the Duoro, and I'm sure that I could have done much more had I rented a car.

Spend 3 days in Lisbon, but on the way there, stop in Nazaré and Óbidos. They’re stunning places!

That said, you've seen a good bit of southern Europe seeing as you've been to Spain, Italy and Greece so many going east would be a chance to experience something new.

Lisbon is an amazing city as well, however I preferred Porto, and my girlfriend did as well. I’d honestly opt out for Algarve towards the end of your trip. It’s great to have a relaxing end of a long trip.

Given your circumstances I'd say go to Albania. It's close to Greece and it might be cheaper / more convinient to stay in the same area. 

If you like mountains / hiking there's one absolutely fantastic thing you should do in Albania: hike in Prokletje. The views are astonishing. You need to get to Shkoder (there's plenty of public buses from Tirana). From Shkoder you can go to Valbone. There are tourist mini-buses which can take you to the ferry on Komani lake and then by mini-bus to Valbone. It's just a village from which you can hike one way to Theth and return back to Shkoder. The whole trip needs at the very least 3 days (but you can easily extend it with more hikes). The lake, the mountains, everything is one of the best experiences in the area I had. For mini-buses you probably can find a good deal online. I booked everything from the hotel desk in Shkoder.

I'm not sure when you are planning to go, but make sure the season is already open. Prokletje is amazing in summer, but it might have plenty of snow early spring / late autumn.",7,2025-04-07 18:26:18,avaika

* Ninh Binh, Ha Giang, Ha Long, and Sapa are all variations on a theme, I think it's fine to pick one or two and leave the others for next time. I personally chose Ninh Binh and Ha Giang, but Ha Giang requires more time than your itinerary allows for.

If I were you I'd take out the south of Vietnam and swap it for Ha Long Bay and more time up north in Vietnam. 

From Hanoi, fly to Phnom Penh if you're interested in the Killing Fields and The Tuol Sleng Museum. If not, skip Phnom Penh and swap it for more time at Ankor. Make sure you get a good guide there, you can visit this place by yourself but you'd miss out on a lot of information.

After Siem Reap, fly to Bangkok and spend more time there. Thailand is relatively safe to drive through by car as long as you stay on the main roads. Consider renting a car for the places that are within driving distance such as Erawan, Kanchanaburi and Khao Yai. These are great for a road trip through the country.

Another thing I do feel I should add is that there are plenty of places in Thailand that are fantastic for snorkeling.

In Windhoek, don’t miss Joe’s Beerhouse. The game meat plate has 5 different types.

travel,1jy646b,mmw21mv,"I love Kamakura, but... I'm afraid you've chosen the most boring sites of the city lol. Hokokuji is nice though.

Tsurugaoka Hachimangu and Komachi street are both horribly crowded, some of the most crowded spots in Japan, and it's the only place in the country over 10 years of travelling where they've tried to scam me. It's so crowded that moving becomes very difficult (and I was there in low season). The shrine is historically relevant, but unless you're a big Minamoto fan then it's nothing amazing and can easily be skipped. Hasedera is also very crowded a comes across a bit gimmicky since it's in a touristy area.

For Kamakura, I believe the best parts are the hikes, tranquil temples and history. Last time I was there I started at Kita-Kamakura station, then did Engaku-ji and Kencho-ji, two very beautiful temples. From Kencho-ji you go to the back of the temple, up the steps, and that's the start of the Ten'en trail. At the end of the trail is Zuisen-ji, and you can easily add Hokokuji which is nearby. If you *are* a big Minamoto fan, go see Yofukuji Temple ruins and the grave of Minamoto Yoritomo. From there, a bus to Kamakura station and the Enoshima railway to Enoshima. This is a more temple and nature focused loop rather than a shopping / tourist loop.

RE: Okinawa. One day for Naha is good, two if you want to go to the Navy Headquarters. Shuri castle is interesting (make sure you're there at opening time, you'll hear the gong when they open the gates), then you can walk down to Shikinaen passing by Tamaudun and Kinjocho Stone Paving. There are places where you can see bingata dyeing, ex. Shuri Ryusen. Then Kokusaidori, Makishi Market, Tsuboya Yachimun Street, down to Fukushuen Gardens. Naha is quite an interesting city.

After that though, I'd recommend leaving Naha and going elsewhere on the main island. The nature is a big part of Okinawa's charm and it's hard to see the best of it in the city. I loved Seifa-utaki and then walked to Tamagusuku, on a different day I went to Kudaka island, then a day in Nakagusuku and finally Uruma island. However, you can also go to some of the other islands if you want a different experience, there are many to choose from.

travel,1jqvj4p,mla472q,"Just Uber. It's cheap here. Metro stations aren't close to tourist spots.

You can find hotels with small pools away from Casco Viejo, like the Riu, they're fine but don't expect US 4-star quality. Most places in PTY are a bit rundown. I've been to PTY probably over 20 times but I don't remember a pool I would have been excited to lounge at for hours.

Personally I'd rather sacrifice pool and stay in Casco Viejo if its your first time. Walkable, nice views, away from traffic chaos, you can even walk to the Cinta Costera from there.

Other ideas to fill your days:  
  
\- Miraflores locks  
\- Wildlife tour on lake Gatun  
\- Metropolitan Natural Park  
\- Ancon hill

Also, as far as walking, DO NOT walk randomly from somewhere like Ancon hill (nice hike!) to Casco Viejo. San Felipe neighborhood is no joke, and NOT a place for tourists, even if it looks like it would be a 20 minute walk. Plus Panama City curbs and pedestrian crossings are a mess, it's really not a very walkable city outside of the Cinta Costera and Casco Viejo. When in doubt, always Uber.",9,2025-04-03 22:36:44,GenXDad507
travel,1jqvj4p,ml9zur5,"I stayed at the American Trade and it was beautiful. Didn’t seem especially loud to me. It’s worth it to stay in Casco Viejo, it’s a beautiful part of the city with great restaurants.",4,2025-04-03 22:11:21,blackhoney917
travel,1jqvj4p,mla0me9,"The neighborhood with all the highrises, where the W is, is fine. There's restaurants and normal city stuff. Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf. There's a park/promenade along the waterfront. The water is nothing to write home about, though seeing the huge tidal range is interesting if you time a visit at high and low tide.

You're unlikely to find a nice hotel with a pool there, but don't stay in the grid area between Santo Tomás and Estación Lotería metro stops. That's where I stayed because I'm cheap, but most of the hotels there are dismal and often meant for sex work. But again I am very cheap, you are unlikely to stay anywhere I've stayed.

If you have any desire to arrive to places dry, just uber everywhere. It's cheap and air conditioned. You're going in the wet season. I did it last year, walked a lot, and either it's sunny and you end up drenched with sweat or it's raining. I realized on one of my last days that I hadn't had a single day where I didn't go back to the hotel wet, except that day, because I rented a car to go see an archaeological site. And then it dumped rain on me as I was leaving.

The metro works fine, but the last station close to Casco Viejo, ""Estación 5 de Mayo"", is still quite far away. It's worth walking once, Av Central Espana is a busy market street, or there's a row of little shops underneath the Pan American Highway viaduct. I never took the bus.

You can take the metro into town from the airport, when I was there Google Maps was still confused about that and claimed you couldn't.",3,2025-04-03 22:15:48,rocketwikkit

travel,1jqvj4p,mlarp1e,"There are great hotels all over. Casco viejo is great but I like staying a bit east of there, around Marbella. Odds are casco viejo will only take a day or two of your time and then you’ll want to go to the causeway or the canal or up ancon and somewhere like el cangrejo or Marbella is easier to get in and out of.

Just make sure you’re far enough east, the area between Marbella and Casco Viejo isn’t great (Calidonia, La exposicion). Where the coast starts running more east west is where it gets better - east of parque urraca if you’re following the coast.",1,2025-04-04 00:57:35,User5281

travel,1jqtznn,mlapw8a,"Important note... the bars on the windows have zero to do with crime and everything to do with tropical storms.  Even some buildings on the mainland do this, like in Florida.  

This is a pretty common assumption by mainlanders that PR and other island countries are ""run down"" but after how many tropical storms a year, you're not going to repaint your house either.  Heck after Maria it took them a few YEARS to clean up a billboard that had blown over in San Juan.",6,2025-04-04 00:46:16,meatwhisper
travel,1jqtznn,mla75zs,"We rented a car in San Juan and immediately drove to the ferry. I've heard they moved it, but back then it was in Fajardo. We spent two nights in Culebra and then back to the mainland for an evening and then two nights in Vieques. On Culebra we rented a golf cart and on Vieques we rented a Jeep. It meant that we were paying for a rental car to sit in parking on the main island the whole time, but that was cheaper than paying for Ubers.

The bioluminescent bay was really cool. We didn't pay for the tour and the guides got pissed at us for checking it out without paying, but whatever they don't own the water.

Vieques was cool, but lots of it was closed due to military presence. Honestly, Culebra was the better island. Flamenco beach was one of the best beaches I've visited in my life. I saw my first manta ray in the wild and it was bigger than me. Most of the tourists on Culebra were locals from the main island who took the ferry out for a day trip, after the last ferry for the day left the island was super quiet and chill.",2,2025-04-03 22:53:48,Post-mo
