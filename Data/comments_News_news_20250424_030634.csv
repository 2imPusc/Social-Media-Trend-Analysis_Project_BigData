The suspect -- 20-year-old Phoenix Ikner, a current FSU student -- was shot by responders and has been hospitalized, police said. He was taken into custody with non-life-threatening injuries, multiple law enforcement officials told ABC News.

Ikner is the son of a current Leon County sheriff's deputy, according to Sheriff Walter McNeil. He had access to one of his mother's personal weapons, which was one of the weapons found at the scene, the sheriff said. It appeared Ikner had a handgun and a shotgun with him, police said.

The suspect's mother has been a deputy with the department for more than 18 years and ""her service to this community has been exceptional,"" McNeil said.

The suspect was also a ""long-standing member"" of the Leon County Sheriff's Office's Youth Advisory Council, McNeil said.

He was ""engaged in a number of training programs that we have,"" the sheriff said, adding, ""Not a surprise to us that he had access to weapons.""...",1465,2025-04-17 22:05:22,StupendousMan1995

news,1jkwtww,mjyu5ry,"Some highlights here, though I do encourage everyone to read the article in full. 

* Prosecutors allege Holmberg traveled to Prague in the Czech Republic 14 times between 2011 and 2021 to pay for sex with boys. 

* Though not part of the charges against Holmberg, two men who said they met him in North Dakota and were victimized by him gave emotional testimony at the hearing. One said Holmberg gave him money to film sex acts in the 1990s. The other man who spoke at the hearing was a cooperating witness who said Holmberg used his political power to groom them for sex. 

* Holmberg said in court that he traveled to Prague with the intent of having sexual contact with minors, that he liked massages and some involved sexual contact. He said he might have received a sexual massage from someone under 18, but he’s not sure.

* In one message, Holmberg sent a cooperating witness a link to a brothel in Prague with the comment, “The boys rent at around $60 … (sex is extra).”

* Holmberg was linked to the investigation of Nicholas Morgan-Derosier, a Grand Forks man who was sentenced in May to 40 years on child pornography charges.

* Holmberg, a Republican who held the powerful positions of Senate Appropriations Committee chair and head of Legislative Management, resigned from the Legislature in 2022. He was indicted on federal charges in October 2023.

* Ray Holmberg, 81, was a Grand Forks state senator for 45 years, and received a sentence that is longer than federal sentencing guidelines. 

* U.S. District Judge Daniel Hovland characterized Holmberg’s conduct as “egregious and despicable” and said he didn’t think the guideline sentence of more than three years was adequate.

* “From my perspective, this was not an isolated case and this is not a victimless crime,” Hovland said. “It displays a pattern of very vile, sickening criminal behavior.”

* Holmberg was sentenced to *10* years. At age 81, it's likely he will die in prison.

* Holmberg is not trans nor a drag queen.",650,2025-03-27 05:41:36,genital_lesions

24 March 2025

The family of a woman who died of strangulation during an overnight visit with her husband at a California prison is questioning why a man convicted of murdering four people was allowed to have family visits:

>Stephanie Diane Dowells, 62, who also went by the name Stephanie Brinson, was killed in November, making her the second person in a year to die at Mule Creek State Prison in Ione during a family visit, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.

>The other victim, Tania Thomas, 47, was also strangled during a family visit, Amador County District Attorney Todd Riebe said in an interview Monday. The man she was visiting has been charged with murder in connection with her killing, Riebe said.

>Dowells, a hairdresser, was killed while visiting her husband, David Brinson, 54, who was convicted in the 1990s of murdering four men during a robbery, and sentenced to four consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole.

>After Brinson called prison officials at 2:04 a.m. on Nov. 13 to tell them his wife had passed out, officers immediately began life-saving measures and called 911, a spokesperson for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said. 

>But Dowells was pronounced dead a short time later.

>Dowells’ killing remains under investigation by prison officials and the district attorney’s office, the spokesperson said. 

>Riebe said charges are pending prison and autopsy reports.",772,2025-03-26 17:28:31,Doodlebug510

I got whooping cough when I was 16.

I cannot stress that please for the love of god, ensure you and your children are immunized for it. It was the worst cough I'd ever had in my life, and you might say ""Why Tycho-Celchu, coughs aren't that bad, it's more of a minor annoyance when you're sick."" and I cannot stress enough: No it is fucking horrible. It's horrible racking coughs that feel like any second your lung tissue is about to be expunged. I would get coughing fits so bad my stomach would contract and I'd throw up. Imagine with every cough you're vomiting more and more and when there's nothing left you're just retching with every hack.

Oh and you know what the alternative name for whooping cough is? The cough of a hundred days. And trust me, you feel everyone of those hundred days. I missed the last month of grade 10 because of it, I went to class once and I coughed so hard I wasn't able to breathe and the entire class panicked and thought I was going to die, complete with my teacher trying frantically to call 911 while I'm trying to stop her.

news,1jstuoq,mlp6ode,"From a different article about how measles impacts children's long term health.

> An estimated 1 out of every 5 kids who catch measles will be hospitalized, and 1 in 20 will get pneumonia, which is what kills most children who die of the disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Some of these hospitalized children will need to be put on a ventilator to recover, Stinchfield said.
In about 1 in 1,000 cases, measles causes brain swelling, or encephalitis, which can cause seizures. When it's not fatal, the swelling itself can subside, but it can cause permanent brain damage and other lasting side effects, such as blindness or deafness. 
The measles virus is capable of replicating in the brain, said Ross Kedl, a professor of immunology at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. In some cases, the immune system beats the virus back and the person seems to recover, but measles still lurks in their nervous system.

> The nightmarish effect of this long-term persistence is a condition called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). This is a progressive neurological disorder that might start with mood changes and muscle tremors; then, as it progresses, the person starts losing speech, vision and hearing. After about two years, the person falls into a coma and dies. 


It can also erase antibodies that their bodies have created to fight other diseases. It's absolutely insane to me people are willing to risk their own children and other immunocompromised people like this.",110,2025-04-06 13:54:05,Peach__Pixie

We are different from the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just around the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know what no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means; it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution.

Volvo Group North America said in a statement it has told employees it plans to lay off 550-800 people at its Mack Trucks site in Macungie, Pennsylvania, and two Volvo Group facilities in Dublin, Virginia, and Hagerstown, Maryland.
The company, part of Sweden's AB Volvo (VOLVb.ST), opens new tab, employs nearly 20,000 people in North America, according to its website.
Trump has upended the global trading system that has been in place for over 75 years with a plan for tariffs on products from across the world. His vacillating trade policy has undermined consumer and business confidence, and caused economists to raise their forecasts for a U.S. recession.

Volvo Group's lay-offs are the latest response from a car and truck industry that is reeling from the Republican president's tariffs on certain parts, which is expected to increase the cost of manufacturing vehicles.
""Heavy-duty truck orders continue to be negatively affected by market uncertainty about freight rates and demand, possible regulatory changes, and the impact of tariffs,"" a spokesperson for Volvo Group North America said in an emailed statement.

And how we burned in the camps later, thinking: What would things have been like if every Security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say good-bye to his family? Or if, during periods of mass arrests, as for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, paling with terror at every bang of the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase, but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else was at hand?... The Organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and, notwithstanding all of Stalin's thirst, the cursed machine would have ground to a halt!

A colossal squid has been filmed in its natural environment for the first time since the species was discovered 100 years ago.

The 30cm-long (11.8in) juvenile was caught on camera at a depth of 600m (1,968ft), near the South Sandwich Islands in the south Atlantic Ocean.

A team of scientists, led by a University of Essex academic, recorded the footage in March during a 35-day quest to find new marine life.

Experts believe colossal squid can grow up to 7m (23ft) in length and weigh up to 500kg (1,100lb) - making them the heaviest invertebrate on the planet.

news,1k0n5su,mnft24n,"Hey, malacologist here for anyone confused- “colossal squid” is the animal’s common name (like “blue whale” or “human”), rather than a description of this particular animal. Adult colossal squid are the largest known molluscs (and in fact the largest known invertebrate), at least by weight, but how big they can really get isn’t really known.

Colossal Squid are deep-sea animals, and due to not needing air they rarely, if ever come close to the surface- the youngest animals usually live deeper than 500m down, and adults are even larger. Before now, the vast majority of colossal squids found have been dead- IiRC the animal was first described from beaks found in Sperm Whale stomachs, and a few animals have been found since. In the last few decades they have been filmed, but the ones we’ve seen before now have been pulled up by fishing nets- there’s quite a famous video of one that was dragged up while holding on to a Patagonian Toothfish it had caught. Even larger juveniles are *huge,* and the aforementioned squid was still massive. Caught specimens also tend to shrink significantly after death, which makes them difficult to measure.

They’re often compared with the Giant Squid, but they aren’t closely related. Giant squid might possibly get *longer*, but Colossal Squid are much bulkier/heavier.

Filming one in its natural habitat is such a big deal because it’s our first chance to see how they behave “normally.” The animal is very poorly known as a result of how difficult it is to observe them (for reference, my area for most of my adult life (so far) was studying squid, I had a special interest in Colossal squid, and *I* barely know anything about them). I’d argue they’re probably one of the most enigmatic animals out there. 

I think they’re also often suggested to be the inspiration behind The Kraken, although I’d personally argue depictions of that particular mythological beast always seem to be more like Octopuses (which can still get pretty large, but not to this degree).

Unilateral facial drooping is absolutely *not* the only symptom of this type of tumour, but if accompanied by gradual hearing loss, suspicion is stronger. Celebrities affected by AN/VS have included:

* Singer/rapper Tionne ""T-Boz"" Watkins of TLC;
* Actor Mark Ruffalo;
* Comedian/artist Vic Reeves;
* Actor Tara Subkoff.

Mark, Vic and Tara have all been left with almost total or complete single-sided deafness following surgical resection, plus nerve damage and/or facial drooping. I'm unsure about any complications experienced by T-Boz, but she was initially refused surgery due to the potential complications associated with her sickle cell disease.

news,1jkhek4,mjw1mv4,"> The bill mostly impacts companies with a controlling shareholder, like Meta Platforms (META.O), which is controlled by Zuckerberg. The proposal provides steps that allow for a company and its controlling shareholder to arrange deals, such as selling corporate assets to the controller, **that cannot be challenged in court by the company's other investors.**

...

> The bill prevents shareholders from challenging deals that are approved by a board committee that has a majority of independent directors or by a vote by public shareholders. The bill also limits records available to shareholders who want to investigate a deal for conflicts.

> Numerous amendments were rejected, including one that would have eliminated the law's retroactive effective date. The law will be effective back to February 17, which one lawmaker said would eliminate potential legal liability for unspecified claims that he said shareholders were investigating against the board of Meta Platforms.

So if a deal (I guess between a company and a controlling shareholder?) was approved by a majority of *independent* directors or by a vote of public shareholders, it can't be challenged in court. That's... gonna be honest, I'm not keen on that. I'm not a big fan of not being able to challenge deals in court. 

But at first glance it doesn't sound like the end of the world, though that may just be me having trouble actually envisioning scenarios like that (help me, corporate lawyers). But at least as long as the deals aren't beholden to conflicts of interest...

...oh. Right. It also limits records available to investigate conflicts.

Gotta say, toe-deep knowledge of corporate law though I may have, I don't think it looks good. Especially the retroactive bit seeming to be specifically for Meta.",41,2025-03-26 19:52:49,nWo1997

A few weeks ago a kid was found with a gun in his backpack and credible plans to shoot. His targets were his bullies and the administrators and teachers who did next to nothing to intervene.

Guns are part of the problem. Parents who own guns and don’t take responsibility for keeping them out of their kids’ hands should be prosecuted… but the root cause is the immeasurable harm that bullying causes to these kids’ emotional health. Stop the bullying, stop the shootings.

I took my kids out of public schools to protect them from these little monsters whose parents don’t teach them basic kindness… but also because I now fear that it’s just a matter of time before one of my babies would wind up caught in the crossfire.

news,1jw6x6w,mmg1n4r,"An overview of what’s known so far:
- Charles Faggart was arrested April 1 in Jacksonville, Florida on two misdemeanor charges: simple assault and criminal mischief.
- On April 7, an “incident” involving eight Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office correctional officers and one correctional sergeant occurred at the Jacksonville jail. (Faggart was subsequently hospitalized, but it’s been known by loved ones since that day that he was brain dead.)
- On April 8, Jacksonville Sheriff T.K. Waters announced the suspension of the officers, saying that the injuries to the inmate (the sheriff’s office did not identify him as Faggart) were “bad, very bad, bad enough for me to come out here and tell the public about it.""
- On April 9, Sheriff Waters announced that the sheriff’s office was requesting the involvement of the FBI in the investigation into the “incident”.
- On April 10, the family attorney announced Faggart’s death.

No details or video of the incident or the names of the officers involved have been released.",949,2025-04-10 19:57:27,GeckoRoamin
