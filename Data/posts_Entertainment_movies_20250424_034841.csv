movies,1jo3nv7,Inglourious Basterds Ending,"Just finished watching and I’ve seen a lot of people say Hans’ betrayal didn’t make sense but to me this ending was practically perfect.

In the first scene Hans harps on the importance of perception. The difference in treatment between rodents (rats and squirrels), and he also revels in the nickname awarded to him by the french (the jew hunter).

He also describes his ability to think like two different beasts, the hawk and the rat, which make him perfect for his role. For most of the film, he is positioned as a hawk as it’s beneficial but by the end we see his ability to align his identity with that of the rat to carve his name on the right side of history.

I also noticed the constant readjustment of his badges throughout the film which I attributed to his receptivity to public opinion and general desire for respect. It makes why he’d prefer to be seen as a double agent rather than a soldier turned halfway through the war.

movies,1js2mnh,What non-horror movie did you find most disturbing?,"I saw the Ballad of Buster Scruggs weeks ago and still can't get it out of my head. It was marketed as a comedy, so I wasn't prepared for how sad and serious some of the stories would be. I had an uneasy, anxious feeling while watching, uncomfortable with the un romanticized nature of the stories. The gold prospector story was nice but still disturbing to see calloused competition and cruelty.

I watch horror movies and usually don't feel disturbed so it's been puzzling trying to pin down why Buster Scruggs got to me.

You just know that things like that did happen during those times and while they happen today too, what disturbs me is that back then it was much more common and normal for tragedies to occur, and there was much less opportunity for accountability and awareness of the true events.

It disturbs me to think that people in the film had a limited ethical and moral compass not because they were evil outliers but simply because they were limited by the era and conditions they were born into. I don't like thinking of this powerlessness.

While watching I felt like I was grieving for my ancestors for what their ""normal"" was, how harsh those times were, and frankly amazed my ancestors survived things like that. It made me feel grateful to be living in modern times, especially with technology.

movies,1k54e5s,A24-ification,"
Just finished my A24 weekend marathon (wrapped up with Everything Everywhere All At Once, Talk to Me, and Civil War) and I'm struck again by how consistently this studio has managed to dominate cultural conversations around film for the past decade.

What started as an indie darling has become a full-on cultural phenomenon - to the point where ""it's an A24 film"" has become shorthand for a certain aesthetic and quality expectation. They've somehow managed to bridge the gap between critical acclaim and cult following in a way that feels unique in today's fragmented media landscape.

Their formula seems deceptively simple: find distinctive directorial voices, give them creative freedom, market the films with striking visuals and minimal exposition, and let word-of-mouth do the rest. But the consistency is remarkable.

What I find most interesting is how they've become a trusted brand for younger audiences who might otherwise be disengaged from non-franchise cinema. The way their films spread through TikTok and social media feels different from traditional film marketing.

Do you think any other studio has matched their cultural impact in recent years? ",1104,0.85,237,2025-04-22 11:53:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1k54e5s/a24ification/,Bluntfeedback

movies,1jpny7s,The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is an absolute delight.,"I rewatched this movie for the first time in a while yesterday and was reminded of how much damn fun this movie is. Each part of the anthology has something else going on it, and carries the energy through, which is hard to do in a collection type work like this.



Anthology pieces invite comparison, and I think the short pieces collected here work well together.



Standout moments for me:


1. Steven Root chasing James Franco down in a homemade suit of armor as Franco tries to shoot him. ""PAN SHOT.""


2. Everything in Meal Ticket. Neeson plays such a convincing sleazebag. This one packs a punch.



3. Tom Waits in the one about the prospector hunting for gold. The land itself is a character here. I could watch him work in the wilderness all day.



4. Every. Dang. Second. of the Oregon Trail love tragedy. The stuff about her brother's dog, named President Pierce, holds a special spot in my heart. ""President Pierce is a nervous creature, and excited by animals larger than himself."" ""Almost all animals are larger than President Pierce.""



5. The last sketch is the only one that doesn't pack quite a punch, and whose ending is telegraphed early on, but watching Tyne Daly and Brendan Gleeson play off one another in the coach is pretty great.

movies,1jmurh9,BASEketball: Squeak is the MVP,"The first scene of pro Baseketball, we see Coop blow the Denslow Cup. He gets psyched out so bad that he falls forward, and barely makes it in the direction of the rim. Squeak made his shot right before to bring Coop to the plate with a chance to walk off Denslow Cup 4. 

Squeak gets roasted nonstop the entire movie. He cannot be psyched out. He gets more fucked up shit said to him than anyone by far. He lives and plays with the best psych-out artists in the league. On the surface he seems like a nervous wreck, but he's the most clutch shooter on the team. He also psychs out Tuttle to beat the LA Riots to clinch a playoff spot.

Squeak always protects Joey's heroic image of Coop, even though Coop is a complete asshole to him. It's all about the kid. He tells Joey that Coop is a major dude, while not pursuing the girl at the bar. Coop falls asleep at the plate, throws the 3rd homerun over the garage, and almost kills Joey at the hospital. Before that, Coop and Remer spend Joey's whole day with the team fighting over Jenna. 

Squeak is a leader. With Denslow Cup 5 slipping away and the team getting blown out, It is Squeak who rallies the team on the Mulakalaka balance board of trust, while dressed as a pineapple. Remer doesn't even try, while Coop merely sucks until then. Once again, Squeak never misses. In fact, the only shot Squeak misses the entire movie is when he's not even playing, and doesn't know the rules yet.

Squeak puts himself in scoring position in the Denslow Cup 5 game so many times, he collapses from running the bases. He then scores the tying run on the game winning shot. Only then, with the championship won, does Squeak engage with the girl from the bar.

Coop is overwhelmed and out of his element as the player/owner. He gets distracted with the ownership of the team on the line by chasing Jenna instead of maintaining the Beers franchise and trying to make the playoffs. He flies to Calcutta to deal with his clothing line scandal and barely makes it back in time for the big game.

Remer is the team cancer. When he doesn't get his way, he pouts. He cares way more about money and status than winning. He actively colludes with the Dallas owner to begin turning the league into everything it was meant not to be. He basically gives up on the team on anal-probe night, dragging the rest of the team down. Only Squeak isn't pissed off about not controlling the team they aren't the owner of.

movies,1jjy32g,Transformers One is such a damn good movie,"And this is coming from someone who isn't even a Transformers fan. IMO one of the best recent animated films in years alongside The Wild Robot (Ironically both starring robots and releasing the same month).

Trailer did this film such injustice that sadly I was amongst those that fell for its marketing costing me what would have been a great experience at the show.

After having heard good things about this film. I decided to give it a shot watching it in the beginning of the new year and then decided on watching it again today and my opinion remains the same as it was first time viewing.

Sadly probably not gonna get a sequel since it underperformed but at the very least I hope this spawns a Paramount+ streaming series if not a series of sequels. 

One way or another, assuming it never gets a continuation. One can always look at this as a prequel to any Transformers continuity. Still the post credits has me craving for more and where this could potentially go.

By no means a flawless movie imo. Bumblebee was amongst them, felt the movie had good enough levity as it was. Felt there was no need for a comic relief. 

But overall I'd give the film 4 out of 5 stars.

movies,1k19giz,"Wasn't the biggest fan of The Whale, but I'm shocked at the number of people who don't seem to understand Charlie's character at all","So many people hate him because they say it was selfish for him to eat himself to death with his daughter back in his life, and if he really loved her, he would try to get better.

But the point of the movie isn't to be some big redemption story for Charlie.  He binge eats because he's essentially given up on himself due to a combination of guilt and self loathing.  He abandoned his family and failed his lover.  Every day he's alive reminds him of what a piece of shit he feels he is.  When you're that deep in the hole, it's not so easy to just pick yourself up and try to get better.  You don't feel like you deserve it.  In his mind, he deserves to die, and the only thing about him that's worth giving to his daughter is his money.

So he saves money for his daughter as a way for him to justify his continued existence, and he doesn't really believe he deserves to be part of her life, so he keeps his distance.

When he finally does contact her, I don't think it's really a rational decision.  He still feels like he doesn't deserve to be in her life, but he knows he's dying, and he can't stomach the idea of leaving the world without having some kind of relationship with her, so he ends up kind of sheepishly trying to re-insert himself into her life to some degree.  I don't think he ever tries to squeeze forgiveness out of her.  He just doesn't want to go to his grave knowing she hates him and that he didn't try to do something right for her before the end.

It's a lot of conflicting emotions and decision-making from a highly flawed human being who doesn't really want to live anymore, but is still trying to ""something"" right with the time he's got left.  Him giving his daughter the money doesn't make up for what he took from her, and that's not really what he's trying to do anyway.  It's all he's really capable of giving her at this point, and he doesn't want to die knowing he did nothing for her at all.

People saying that he should've just stopped eating clearly don't understand why he's eating.  It's not because he loves food.  It's because he hates himself.  He doesn't feel like he deserves to live, but he's also still afraid of death.  The base human instinct to continue living is extremely strong.  Anyone who's been severely depressed and suicidal but still can't stop themselves for going about their daily routine can tell you that.  So he eats to numb the pain, and once he realizes it's killing him, he sees it as a just punishment for his failings as a person and allows it to continue happening.

I can understand not empathizing that much with Charlie to some degree, but the people who see his refusal to get well as actively malicious and selfish on his part don't really understand what it's like to be truly depressed to that degree.  You might as well be telling a suicidal person to just ""suck it up"" or a depressed person to just ""stop being depressed"".  When you're that deep in the hole, it's nearly impossible to pull yourself out because you've already resigned yourself to death and also to the idea that you're not worth saving, and everyone would be better off with you gone.

Same thing with him hiding his money from the caretaker.  He wasn't consciously doing it to make her life harder.  He was doing it because he felt he didn't deserve to get better, and he knew if he'd told her, she wouldn't have understood because who would willingly watch someone kill themselves like that.

I think it was realistic how frustrated people became with him, but also a little grating at times that no one seemed to be able to comprehend why a mentally ill person would make irrational, self destructive decisions.

He's not a hero, and he's not a villain.  He's a guy who made an incredibly selfish, impulsive decision, caused a lot of suffering as a result, and then paid for it with his happiness and his life.  When we meet him, that person is long dead, and he's a shell of the man who did those things.  I don't think the film is trying to absolve Charlie of his past wrongdoings.  It's just painting a picture of an unfortunate situation that people often find themselves in in the real world.  There aren't always happy endings or meaningful lessons to learn.",742,0.88,79,2025-04-17 10:27:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1k19giz/wasnt_the_biggest_fan_of_the_whale_but_im_shocked/,moal09

There are so many amazing actors who disappear in roles, thanks to not only their own talent, but also the number of people behind them who assist with various aspects necessary to create the character…it’s one of my favorite things about movies - how many people come together to create art that is totally unique even when the “materials used” to create it are the same.

movies,1k4o61c,"April 18-20 Box Office Recap: 'Sinners' opens with a fantastic $48 million domestically, making it the best opening for a live-action original film in years. Meanwhile, 'A Minecraft Movie' crosses $700 million worldwide.","https://preview.redd.it/ve54b1yp29we1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=d66d93333fd7c823d8b731a79eebfac3bfbba7ad

On Easter weekend, audiences decided to go watch ***Sinners***. The result? A #1 debut, and the biggest debut for an original film in the post-COVID era. While ***A Minecraft Movie*** had to cede the top spot, it's already over $700 million worldwide.

The Top 10 earned a combined $127.9 million this weekend. That's up a massive 109.7% from last year, when ***Civil War*** held the top spot from disappointing newcomers like ***Abigail*** and ***The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare***.

Debuting atop, Ryan Coogler's ***Sinners*** earned a fantastic $48 million in 3,308 theaters. This is the best debut for Coogler's career outside the ***Black Panther*** films. In fact, it's the biggest debut for a live-action original film in the post-COVID climate, opening above ***Nope*** ($44.3 million).

Simply put, it's a fantastic start. Take into account, getting an original film to open this high is a miracle, given that audiences are pivoting to focusing on franchises. It's a testament to the strength of Ryan Coogler and Michael B. Jordan. So how they did succeed where other original films failed?

For the past decade, Coogler has earned some great good will, thanks to his works in films like ***Creed*** and ***Black Panther***. The films have earned fantastic reception, allowing him to finally get an original title like ***Sinners*** to get greenlit. It wasn't easy, obviously; a big reason why some studios turned it down was Coogler's request to have the film rights revert to him after 25 years. So Warner Bros. took the bullet and agreed to his terms, [a decision that apparently scared a lot of Hollywood executives.](https://www.vulture.com/article/to-hollywood-the-scariest-part-of-sinners-is-ryan-coogler.html)

The film's clear selling point was Coogler and Jordan, but the premise was also very important: a 1930s horror film, with Jordan playing twins. 2025 has been very weak for horror; the biggest horror film is ***The Monkey***, which hasn't even topped $70 million worldwide. The audience was starving for a horror film and ***Sinners*** arrived at the right time to offer just that. The film's fantastic reviews cannot be ignored either; it's sitting at a marvelous 98% on Rotten Tomatoes and 84/100 on Metacritic. That makes it one of the best films of the year, so even non-horror fans wanted to see if the film would live up to the hype.

According to Warner Bros., the biggest demos were black (49%), Caucasians (27%), Hispanic and Latino (14%), and Asian (6%). They gave it an incredible ""A"" on CinemaScore. This makes it one of the few horror films to get an ""A"" on the site (***Poltergeist*** and ***Aliens*** are the other two) in its 46-year-old history. Yes, it's insanely hard for a horror film to get this grade.

What does this mean? That the film is gonna have some damn great legs. It's already seen in the weekend; horror films can drop over 40% on Sunday, yet ***Sinners*** dropped just 25%. With no horror competition till ***Final Destination: Bloodlines***, ***Sinners*** can have a lot of space. For now, we're predicting a $170 million domestic total for the film, which is simply fantastic all around.

***A Minecraft Movie*** dropped 48% this weekend, grossing $40.4 million. That's not a bad drop, but it's still rough just like last week's. The film is not collapsing, but it's not showing great legs either. The film has amassed $343.8 million so far, and it should still hit over $450 million domestically. 

Unsurprisingly, ***The King of Kings*** benefitted from the Easter weekend. It dipped just 9%, earning $17.5 million this weekend. That's one of the best holds for a film playing at over 3,000 theaters. Through 10 days, the film has earned $45.6 million, although with the holiday over, maybe it will have a steep drop next weekend.

20th Century Studios' ***The Amateur*** was hit by the arrival of ***Sinners***. It dropped a rough 53%, earning $7 million this weekend. While the film was aiming an old audience that doesn't go to opening weekend, it looks like the film is struggling to leg out. Through 10 days, the film has earned a weak $27.1 million, and it remains a question mark if it will hit $40 million domestically.

In fifth place, A24's ***Warfare*** dipped 42%, adding $4.8 million this weekend. Through 10 days, the film has earned $17.1 million, and it will probably end its run with around $25 million domestically.

Universal/Blumhouse's ***Drop*** added $3.2 million this weekend, which is a poor 55% drop after its already low start. Despite positive reviews and word of mouth, the audience doesn't appear to be interested in the film. Through 10 days, it has earned just $13.4 million, and it's now guaranteed to miss $20 million domestically, making it one of Blumhouse's lowest grossing titles.

***COLORFUL STAGE! The Movie: A Miku Who Can’t Sing*** managed to sneak into the seventh spot, despite playing in just 800 theaters, earning $2.8 million this weekend.

Focus Features' re-release of ***Pride & Prejudice*** earned $2.8 million in 1,393 theaters. That takes its lifetime total to $41.3 million.

***The Chosen: Last Supper — Part 3*** collapsed 75% this weekend, earning just $1.5 million this weekend. Through all 3 installments, the show has made $42.9 million so far.

Rounding up the Top 10 was Disney's ***Snow White***, which is nearing the end of its run. It had another brutal 58% drop, earning just $1.2 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at a poor $84.6 million so far.

Bleecker Street released ***The Wedding Banquet*** in 1,142 theaters, although the film earned just $922,906. That means that the film is gonna make less than what Ang Lee's original made back in 1993 ($6.9 million).

But the real worst performer of the week was Briarcliff's animated film ***Sneaks***. Despite playing in 1,500 theaters, the film earned an abysmal $530,786 this weekend. That's one of the worst debuts for a film playing in over 1,000 theaters. Expect this to fade quickly.

Ahead of its wide release this week, A24's ***The Legend of Ochi*** debuted in 4 theaters, earning $52,514. That's a $13,129 per-theater average, which is quite low (usually buzzy titles like this make $25K or more). Let's just hope it can do better when it hits wide release.

Janus Films also released David Cronenberg's ***The Shrouds*** in 3 theaters, where the film earned $49,361. Alos a low $16,454 per-theater average. It will continue expanding in the coming weeks.

#**OVERSEAS**

***A Minecraft Movie*** earned $59 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $720 million. The best markets are the UK ($59.2M), Germany ($27.8M), Australia ($27.4M), Mexico ($24.8M) and China ($24M). The billion mark is becoming more and more likely, pals.

***Sinners*** earned $15.4 million in 71 markets, taking its worldwide numbers to $63.5 million. The best debuts were in the UK ($3.2M), France ($2M), Mexico ($1.1M), Germany ($898K) and Australia ($842K). An okay start, but it's pretty clear it's gonna lean heavily on the domestic side.

***The Amateur*** added a further $11.6 million this weekend, for a $63.8 million worldwide total. The best markets are the UK ($4.1M), France ($3.3M), Mexico ($3.2M), Japan ($2.3M) and Spain ($2M). At the very least, it should hit $100 million worldwide. That'd be great if it didn't cost $60 million.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Dog Man* | Jan/31 | Universal | $36,001,940 | $97,970,355 | $140,534,355 | $40M

- DreamWorks' ***Dog Man*** has ended its run with $97 million domestically and $140 million worldwide. Definitely a success, given it cost just $40 million. But something weird about the film are its legs. Normally, animated films leg out to a 3x multiplier. But ***Dog Man*** finished with just a 2.72x multiplier, making it one of the most front-loaded animated films. While the Super Bowl impacted its second weekend, not hitting the $100 million milestone after its debut is kinda disappointing. But then again, this should be enough if DreamWorks wants a new franchise.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

We've got three wide releases, though it's unlikely any of them can take the top spot.

The closest that could challenge the top spot is Amazon MGM's ***The Accountant 2***, which brings back Ben Affleck, Jon Bernthal, Cynthia Addai-Robinson, and J. K. Simmons in their roles. The original film earned $155 million worldwide, and has been a huge success in streaming and home media, so a sequel was pretty much imminent. Although the 9-year gap raises concerns that they might have waited too long.

Another release is Sony's ***Until Dawn***, an adaptation of the video game. Director David F. Sandberg has had success in the horror field, and in fairness, the movie tries to change things up from the game. Nevertheless, the film's premise (a time loop involving different killers) suggests it pretty much abandoned the game's original plot. It remains to be seen if the fans will be willing to buy a ticket.

And as mentioned, A24's ***The Legend of Ochi*** is hitting wide release. The limited release numbers were quite underwhelming, but perhaps it could surprise when it hits wide release.

movies,1juswsc,The T-Rex in Jurassic Park is the Greatest Special Effect Ever - And I'm not Talking About the CGI One,"So, *Jurassic Park* is a very important movie to me. I'm in my early thirties, and I've grown up watching this movie, as well as it's first two sequels (I'm admittedly not a fan of the *World* sequels). I've seen it more than any other movie by far, and it never ceases to amaze me. When I was a kid in the 90's, entering the Jurassic Park section at Universal Studios in Florida was a magical experience as they perfectly re-captured the feeling of entering the park from the movie. The music still gives me goosebumps every time I hear it. My favorite dinosaur? It's got to be the T-Rex. And I truly believe it's the greatest special effect that was ever in a movie, or ever will be. And I'm not talking about the CGI one - despite being a ground breaking achievement, it doesn't hold a candle to the life sized animatronic Stan Winston Studios created for the movie.

Unfortunately, over the years, I feel like the life sized animatronic T-Rex has been overshadowed by the CGI one. Sure, it a huge step in a totally new form of digital effects. And sure, 30 years later and it still manages to hold up due to Spielberg's restraint and cleaver usage of the medium. But having an actual 30 foot tall [T-Rex sized robot that looks and moves as realistic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFTsYGgdR9k&t=59s) as it did is just jaw dropping. I'm currently watching the Industrial Light & Magic docuseries on Disney+ and they, along with everyone else in other similar videos discussing the cultural impact of the film, always highlight the CGI effects and don't seem to spend as much time discussing how incredible the practical effects were. 

During quarantine, I was lucky enough to interview Stan Winston's son Matthew Winston regarding his father's legacy. He told me how he was present on set for multiple movies his father worked on, and got to be up close and personal with Aliens, Predators, Terminators, Pumpkinheads and everything in between, but nothing was as incredible and surrealistic as seeing the T-Rex in all it's glory. I could only imagine how mystifying that would have been.

They went even bigger with *The Lost World* by having two T-Rexes. Say what you will about that movie, but they absolutely devoured every scene they were in (sharing a bite with each other is one of the coolest deaths in the series). While the third movie continued the practical dinos, the modern trilogy either seemed to lean fully into CGI (which is already dated) or used practical effects that were somehow less effective than ones used decades prior. 

How do you feel about the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park? Have they left a huge impression on you? Do you think any special effect has come close? I personally think Gollum in LOTR would be the most noteworthy, and I also think the practical effects, costumes, set design, etc in that trilogy is phenomenal as well.

movies,1jmhcmi,The World's End became way more relevant than I initially gave it credit for,"This movie came out over 10 years ago; I don't think I have to litigate its quality to anyone here. 

I originally saw this movie in 2014, a couple years after it released. I figured, it's no match for Shaun of the Dead, which I grew up watching from when I was 10, and not as clever as Hot Fuzz. It was just a lukewarm movie that I got a handful of laughs out of. 

It wasn't until I entered adulthood that I realized how much this movie spoke to who I am as a person. It laid bare my inadequacies far clearer than any media I have ever viewed.

I think the vast majority of viewers see Gary King as a pitiful character. Some may have even known someone like him. 

One thing that has always struck me about this movie in later years is that it felt like it was talking directly to me in its plot points and characters.

Gary King is not just a fictional character. He's me. I've never felt more affinity for a fictional character than hearing Gary's monologue towards the end of the film. 

""That was supposed to be the beginning of my life. All that promise and fucking optimism. It was a big lie. Nothing happened.""

Fuck, man. I watched this shit for the first time when I was a sophomore in high school, out of obligation for Shaun and Fuzz at the time. I had no idea it would go on to describe an essential part of who I was for 10 years. 

I like to think that most people empathize with Gary here, but some of us really are that fucking pathetic to hold on to our ""glory days"" all these years later. For some of us, it really was all we ever had.

I realized just how good of a movie it is and not just based off being a fan of DND. There’s so much to like about this movie even if you don’t like or care about DND.

The dialogue is tight. The plot is simple, but endearing. Characters are defined quickly and are all played really well. You can feel the sincerity and fun they had being these characters and being in the movie. 

With Snow White being all over with comments from the actress disparaging romance in movies. I like how the movie counters the romantic plot being needed without having to call attention to it. I especially love Ed and Holga’s relationship and how naturally platonic it is without needing one of them being secretly in love with the other or something cliche like that. I love how it ties into the overall plot as well with Ed realizing Holga was the mother his daughter loved and deserved. It reinforces the platonic dynamic and gives you an alternative family dynamic without feeling like it needs to justify it or parade it around unlike other movies that see it as a selling point.

movies,1jo09uu,I was NOT expecting Pan’s Labyrinth to end like that,"This movie has been on my watchlist for a long time and I finally got around to seeing it tonight.

I thought the special effects were rly well done, especially the CGI given the time this
came out.

I also loved the way this is more of a war period piece than a straight up fantasy, and how it blends aspects of fantasy into its very ground story!

I was honestly expecting for it to be like a Tim Burton-esque “Labyrinth [circa 1986]” where after she first goes into the labyrinth it takes her on a magical journey, but I was pleasantly surprised how much of the storyline is just between the drama of fascists and the resistance. The moments of fantasy act as a nice addition to how Ofelia sees the world as a coping mechanism to the trauma around her (war, her mother’s sickness, etc.)

I am so curious as to what was real and what was just in Ofelia’s head, because Vidal physically picked up the baby Groot fetus thing and threw it into the fire… but then the Pale Man wasn’t there from Vidal’s perspective when he chased her through the labyrinth, so can only she see these spiritual entities or..?

I also just.. I was not expecting for her to die at the end let alone getting shot point blank like that. I haven’t been this shocked watching a movie in a long time, I was lying down and when that happened I shot my head up and sat up in pure disbelief, mouth agape, eyes watering. The ending made me cry fr seeing her in the afterlife reunited with her family and having the “prophecy” fulfilled for the “princess to return to the land of spirits/leave the land of mortals” wrapped up the fantasy aspects of the movie in such a way that made me rethink the meaning of everything fantasy-related that I just watched. 

What i didn’t like about the movie was that there are a few little blunders with the audio syncing  and also seeing someone who’s dead breathe for a slit second mildly takes me out of the movie for a sec, but other than that I give nothing but praise for this film. Praise for the costume designers who adorned the rich environments that brought colorful life into each scene, esp. the fantasy set pieces! Praise for the adult acting and the NOT god-awful child acting muchísimas gracias a Ivana Baquero por darnos un gran performance fr. Praise to how Del Toro worked his craft and made such a unique, eerie, curious, intense work of art that pushes boundaries and major took risks with its characters. Mad respect to u for that Sr. del Toro. What a wonderfully melancholic movie, I can’t wait to see it again with actual subtitles this time when i buy the blu-ray

movies,1jjiuww,Marketing/trailers that tried to trick audiences,"A recent strange phenomenon is how Hollywood goes out of its way to hide the fact that musicals are musicals in the marketing. The trailers won't show any of the characters singing and will make it look like it's a normal movie. The reason for this seems to be that marketing teams know that some people don't like musicals, so they think they can get them to buy a ticket by tricking them into thinking a musical is not a musical and I guess hope that they won't bother doing any research beforehand. Wonka and Mean Girls are some recent examples of this.

But Hollywood does this kind of deceitful marketing all the time. Most infamously, the movie [Kangaroo Jack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuyLeUjuT_k)'s marketing made it look like a fun family movie with a talking kangaroo that raps, but in reality it's a comedic crime movie for adults and the kangaroo barely appears and only talks in one scene where a character is hallucinating. In fact, the movie was originally R-Rated and was going to be called Down and Under, but then was retitled and edited to a PG rating by producers because the kangaroo scene was the only think test audiences liked.

So what other movie marketing campaigns tried to basically trick audiences into thinking that the movie was going to be about something else or even of a different genre?",596,0.88,443,2025-03-25 13:03:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jjiuww/marketingtrailers_that_tried_to_trick_audiences/,AporiaParadox

But as I got older I started realizing more and more that “Ghostbusters 2” had a less than stellar reputation. That shocked me. I mean is it as good as the first? No. But it’s still a damn good time. It’s got a great plot device(negative charged slime), a scary bad guy(VIGO!), some fun set pieces(court room bust) but most all?
You get to spend time with these actors playing these characters. They have this wonderful chemistry together. 

They have such great chemistry. I remember coming across the IMDb score for the 2nd Ghostbusters. Back then it was much lower than it is now. In the 5/10 range. What gives?

I watched Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel, fans of the first film, rip the sequel to shreds. 

I would read how critics and audiences thought it’s a retread of the first film, it wasn’t funny, didn’t make sense. “Why are people still not believing in ghosts after the first film”. That last one never made sense to me. In the entire film only like 3 people say they don’t believe. One or which is an insane judge. Another a kid I mean…it’s 2025 and people still think we didn’t go to the moon or that the earth is flat. So I don’t think everyone would be accepting to the idea of ghosts and marshmallow men.

Even knowing the outcome, this movie hooked me in ways I didn’t expect. It is not about what happens it is about how it happens. Watching these 12 strangers argue ,clash nd unravel felt like seeing raw human nature laid bare. Their biases , egos nd frustrations it ia all so uncomfortably real nd that is where the brilliance lies !!
The cinematography blew me away. At first, the camera looks down on the jurors like we are judging them from a distance but as the movie progresses the angles shift. The room feels tighter ,the shots get closer nd by the end, we are looking up at these men. It is subtle but genius without saying a word , Sidney Lumet forces us to respect them , to understand that justice requires effort, humility nd courage.
Speaking of Lumet how is this his debut feature film? The man came in swinging. His ability to pull such distinct layeered performances from his cast is ridiculous. Every juror feels so real like you kinda have met them before lol tthe stubborn one , the quiet one , the loud one who doesn’t shut up etc ..nd yet, together, they form this chaotic but gripping puzzle. Lumet doesn’t overdo anything like he keeps it simple , letting the dialogue nd performances do all the heavy lifting lol . As much as I loved the movie , it doesn’t quite fit the intensity I usually crave in films. Don’t get me wrong this is smart, layered nd almost flawless but it is more cerebral than emotional ,I honestly didn’t feel gutted by it the way I do with darker nd more tragic stories. It challenged me sure but it didn’t hit as hard as I expected

movies,1jj2j39,"March 21-23 Box Office Recap: It was another terrible weekend, as 'Snow White' flopped with an awful $85.3 million worldwide, against a $270 million budget. Meanwhile, 'The Alto Knights' also flopped with just $3.1 million domestically.","https://preview.redd.it/t9od7mdwgpqe1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=8dbdf627ab9d7355869c0772f7334f9c0b3a6c65

Another brutal weekend at the box office.

Despite topping the box office, ***Snow White*** massively flopped in its opening weekend, indicating it was a bad apple after all. But that wasn't the only flop this weekend. WB also released ***The Alto Knights***, and it had one of the worst debuts for a film playing at over 2,500 theaters. Oh and there was also the long-delayed debut of ***Magazine Dreams***, which unsurprisingly tanked in 815 theaters.

The Top 10 earned a combined $68.5 million this weekend. That's off a rough 30.3% from last year, when ***Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire*** topped the box office.

Debuting in first place, ***Snow White*** flopped with just $42.2 million in 4,200 theaters. This debut is lower than the live-action ***Dumbo*** remake ($45.9 million), coincidentally another adaptation of a very old Disney property. It's so far off from other recent films like ***The Little Mermaid*** ($95.5M), ***Maleficent*** ($69.4M), and ***Cinderella*** ($67.8M).

The bad news don't stop there. These numbers are eerily similar to the debut of ***The Marvels*** ($46.1 million), which also had a similar budget to ***Snow White*** ($270 million). So yep, ***Snow White*** is performing right on par with one of the biggest flops in movie history.

While Disney has had success with their live-action remakes, there's always that black sheep that deviates from the formula and that's the case with ***Snow White***. The film had a similar case to ***Dumbo***, in that the original films are very old (the original ***Snow White*** is 88 years old and ***Dumbo*** is 84 years old). While the public is aware of these films and know they're iconic, perhaps their popularity hasn't been as big as other animated films like ***The Lion King***, ***Aladdin*** or ***Beauty and the Beast***.

It didn't help that ***Snow White*** has been done to death for the past decades. So it falls into the same problem as other stories like ***Robin Hood***, ***The Three Musketeers***, or ***Sherlock Holmes***, in that the public can recognize them but that doesn't mean they'll watch everything with them. Of course, some hit bigger than others. In 2012, ***Snow White and the Huntsman***, a dark reimagining, made almost $400 million worldwide. Simply put, the Disney remake didn't offer much to differentiate itself from other adaptations.

Alright, now we have to address two big problems with the film, which are main factors for its performance. The first involves the Seven Dwarfs, which are, obviously, pivotal to the story. Back in 2022, Peter Dinklage expressed his frustration with the film, deeming it a ""backward story"". So Disney decided to simply... make the Dwarfs with CGI instead of casting actors with dwarfism. And the design used for the film simply looks... awful. Even though Dinklage faced backlash for his comment, it was Disney who made the decision to listen and act upon it. But that's not everything.

Rachel Zegler has been the subject of media attention since 2022, when she made comments joking about the Prince and Snow White's characterization in the original film. These comments have been in the eye of the public for the past years, drawing negative attention to the remake. Gal Gadot didn't escape criticism either; not just for her perceived lack of acting range, but because of her Israel support. Whether you agree or not with everything just mentioned, it's clear the general audience wasn't content in the slightest with anything.

So that's basically it. It's a simply a factor of so many decisions that went awry, as well as an incredibly high $270 million budget. Disney knew this, which is why they scaled back on the premieres and press junkets for the film. Add in very weak reviews (44% on RT), and the film has already lost so many people.

According to Disney, 68% of the audience was female and 47% was in the 18-34 demographic. Even though it's a family film, only 15% of the audience was 17 and under. So kids were pretty much not interested in the film.

The long term prospects for ***Snow White*** don't look great. It received a lukewarm ""B+"" on CinemaScore, which is worse than any of the Disney live-action remakes, and suggests word of mouth will only be a bit better than its reviews. With competition like ***A Minecraft Movie*** coming up, ***Snow White*** is unlikely to leg out and it's set to be one of the lowest Disney remakes. For now, a domestic total around $110 million is likely. Which means it will make less money than ***Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs*** ($184.9 million) and that's not even adjuste for inflation! Another failure for Disney this year.

Steven Soderbergh's ***Black Bag*** kept the second place spot, earning $4.2 million this weekend. That's a good 44% drop from last weekend, although its numbers are still way too small to make it look notable. Through 10 days, the film has earned $14.7 million, and it will finish with over $20 million domestically.

***Captain America: Brave New World*** may have weak word of mouth, but the very lack of competition is working wonders. The film eased just 29%, adding $4 million this weekend. That took its domestic total to $192 million.

After topping the box office last week, ***Novocaine*** felt a gut punch this weekend. The film dropped a very rough 58%, earning $3.6 million this weekend and falling to fourth place. That's just brutal, although it's a better drop than Jack Quaid's previous film, ***Companion***, which collapsed 67.7% (but ***Companion*** faced the Super Bowl in its second weekend). Through 10 days, the film has earned a meager $15.6 million, and won't make it much further than $20 million, especially with three wide releases coming up this weekend.

With the loss of PLF screens, ***Mickey 17*** suffered another rough drop this weekend. It dropped 51% and added $3.6 million this weekend. The film has earned a very weak $40 million, and with the film hitting PVOD tomorrow, it will continue falling. For now, it should finish with around $45 million domestically.

It's not until sixth place where we find the other newcomer, WB's ***The Alto Knights***. Debuting in 2,651 theaters, the film flopped with a horrific $3.1 million this weekend. That's one of Robert De Niro's worst debuts as leading man, as well as the 26th worst debut for a film playing at over 2,500 theaters.

The film achieved some notoriety, given that it was the first film greenlit by David Zaslav when he joined Warner Bros. Discovery back in 2022. But there were already signs that the film would struggle. For starters, director Barry Levinson had a very successful career... but that peaked in the 90s. His films in the 21st century have been flopping across the board, suggesting he might not deliver the quality he once commanded. Not to mention that gangster films haven't fared well in the past few years.

There's also the very weird decision to cast Robert De Niro in the roles of both Vito Genovese and Frank Costello, even though they are not twins nor anything. WB has also moved the release date, and the first trailer didn't premiere till two months ago, which is a very short release window for a major film. And despite the amount of names attached, reviews were very poor (39% on RT). The film simply couldn't overcome the ""been there, done that"" feeling that plagued other gangster films.

According to WB, 58% of the audience was male. Unsurprisingly, it skewed massively old; 77% of the audience was 35 and over, and 33% over 55. They gave it a middling ""B"" on CinemaScore, which is simply not good for its long-term prospects. With many new releases coming up, ***The Alto Knights*** will disappear quickly from theaters. It would be a surprise if it finished anywhere close to $10 million.

***The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie*** added $1.8 million this weekend. That's a 41% drop, which isn't bad, but it's kinda rough for an animated film. Through 10 days, the film has earned just $6.5 million so far. Despite these low numbers, Ketchup looks content with its performance, given that they are currently bidding $50 million to acquire ***Coyote vs. Acme***.

In eighth place, Neon's ***The Monkey*** eased 39%, adding $1.5 million. That takes its domestic total to $37.8 million.

In ninth place, DreamWorks' ***Dog Man*** dropped 42% and added $1.4 million this weekend. The film has amassed $95.6 million and it's on its last legs to hit the $100 million milestone.

Rounding up the Top 10 was ***The Last Supper***, which added $1.3 million this weekend. That's off 51% from last week, which is a very bad drop for a Christian drama. Through 10 days, the film has earned $5.3 million so far.

2 years after its debut in Sundance, ***Magazine Dreams*** has finally hit theaters. Released by Briarcliff in 815 theaters, the film tanked with just $701,365 this weekend. This shouldn't be a surprise to anyone; you really expect the public to pay a ticket for a film with Jonathan Majors?  

RLJ Entertainment also released ***Ash*** in 1,136 theaters, but the film flopped with a terrible $689,144. Expect it to fade quickly.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Snow White*** led the overseas box office, yet its numbers were far below the most pessimistic scenario. It debuted with a very weak $43.1 million overseas, for a terrible $85.3 million worldwide debut. Wow, not even hitting $100 million is pathetic. The film had very weak numbers in the UK ($5.1M), Mexico ($4.1M), Italy ($4M), France ($3M) and Spain ($2.6M). With a debut this soft, you can count on something: the film is not making it to $300 million worldwide, and $250 million could be in danger if it collapses. As mentioned, this cost $270 million. Big, big failure.

***Mickey 17*** added $8.7 million this weekend, taking its worldwide numbers to $109.8 million. The best markets are South Korea ($19.6M), UK ($7.5M), France ($6.8M), Germany ($3.6M) and Mexico ($3.3M).

***Captain America: Brave New World*** added $3.1 million, allowing the film to cross $200 million worldwide. The best markets are the UK ($22.5M), Mexico ($16M), China ($14.4M), France ($14M) and Korea ($11.4M).

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Love Hurts* | Feb/7 | Universal | $5,800,440 | $15,683,090 | $17,561,938 | $18M

- Well, it truly lived up to its title. ***Love Hurts*** has ended its run with a very poor $17 million, below its already low $18 million. While Ke Huy Quan is in the middle of a return to films, this was an offer he was better off turning down. He reportedly accepted the role after Steven Spielberg convinced him. Ouch.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

There's three wide releases this weekend. And while ***Snow White*** will probably continue at the top spot, one film will fight to be as close as possible.

That film is Amazon MGM's ***A Working Man***, starring Jason Statham. The plot is... come on, you watch a Jason Statham film for the plot? What's important is that it's action, that's it. Statham is a very reliable name, with his latest film, ***The Beekeeper***, earning over $150 million worldwide last year. 

There's also the release of A24's ***Death of a Unicorn***, which stars Paul Rudd and Jenna Ortega as a father and daughter who accidentally hit and kill a unicorn, causing them to be hunted down by its parents. Despite a promising premise, reviews out of SXSW aren't glowing (currently at a middling 64% on RT).

The other release is Universal/Blumhouse's ***The Woman in the Yard***, which follows a family that sees a strange woman, dressed in all black, staying in their yard. Blumhouse is currently not at its best; their previous film, ***Wolf Man***, was one of their few box office flops. With a very generic premise and lack of buzz, it'd be a surprise if this film got close to $10 million this weekend.

**Summary**  
*Warfare* is a gritty and immersive war drama co-directed by Alex Garland and former Navy SEAL Ray Mendoza. Based on a real mission in Ramadi, Iraq, the film puts the chaos of modern combat front and center, stripping away political commentary in favor of a boots-on-the-ground perspective that emphasizes intensity, camaraderie, and the psychological cost of war.

movies,1js4mx6,What are the best or most iconic title drops in movies?,"Or maybe just some that you consider to be your favorite? Is it notorious and awkwardly delivered like Will Smith's line, ""So that's it, huh? Were some type of Suicide Squad?"" or was it woven into the dialogue in a more memorable way like when Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown said, ""We're sending you back to the future!"", or was it just a throwaway line and something completely unexpected when it was uttered? 

What was it that made you sit up and point at the screen like Leonardo DiCaprio in ""Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood"" and announce ""HE SAID THE THING""?

movies,1jzno5m,"[US] The King of Kings (2025): Y'know, for kids. (Jesus Christ!)","I was made to watch *The King of Kings* yesterday, and I’m still processing the fact that someone watched *The Passion of the Christ* and thought:

“Let’s do that again. But make it adorable.”

There’s no mystery to what this is—it’s a sermon dressed as an animated film. Imagine if *The Prince of Egypt* had less artistry, less heart, and more of that weird Sunday school energy where you’re afraid to ask questions. That’s this.

The movie starts with Charles Dickens (yes, really) telling his kids bedtime stories about Jesus, which somehow becomes the framing device for a full-on Gospel recap. The animation? Think *Pixar meets Playmobil*. Big heads. Smooth, rubbery faces. That eerie uncanny valley where everyone looks like they were designed in a Christian metaverse.

But the tone is the real kicker. One second you’re watching cartoon kids giggle at the manger. The next, Jesus is being flogged behind a post by a dead-eyed Roman doll with a whip. When they lift Funko-Jesus onto the cross, I actually said “no way” out loud.

This movie in the (un)holy baby of tonal mismatch and weird choices: Roman officials are “complex,” but every Jewish character who questions Jesus is a full-on villain with the face of a propaganda sketch. That’s not subtext. That’s just text.

To be clear: If you want to show this to your kids, fine. But don’t pretend this is a movie. It’s a delivery system for doctrine. And at times, it feels like the kind of doctrine that doesn’t trust children to think for themselves.

This’ll be sold as wholesome family entertainment. Personally? I think it’s a little terrifying.",496,0.77,252,2025-04-15 09:34:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jzno5m/us_the_king_of_kings_2025_yknow_for_kids_jesus/,Man_of_Stool

One issue I have with it though is Neil is presented as a highly intelligent and calculated criminal. When he is talking to Michael telling him that he has other sources of income **""t-bonds, real estate""** and that he should cut lose. Shouldn't Neil also have other sources of income as well, alternative ways of making money. it almost makes it sound like he is dependent on the bank job and the scores he does, but maybe I am looking into it too much in that scene

I never got the hate for this one. Fun creature feature with some pretty brutal graphics at times. The eyeball scene and some of the killer gorillas getting their limbs amputated by the laser weapon in the climax. All done practical then the CGI slop that overtakes Hollywood nowadays.

Sure its campy notably the infamous ""Stop eating my sesame cake!"" but that's what made it entertaining for me.

And as a sucker for creature features. This one still holds up imo.

It's no Jaws or Jurassic Park (This and Congo were movies based on novels by Michael Crichton) but still entertaining in its own right notably it's camp factor and the brutality we see at times.

movies,1jyg7q6,An appreciation for the dying art of practical Blood Squibs. There’s just something different about them. It’s one of the last things I feel CGi hasn’t been able to replicate 100% correct. What are some of the greatest blood squib effects in film?,"I love blood squibs. For anyone who doesn’t know, these are practical blood packs put on an actor or stunt person to simulate bullet hits. Are they realistic? No. But there is something visceral and cool about them. And they are becoming a lost art. 

You can see why CGI blood hits have taken over. Blood squibs take ALOT OF TIME. There’s the rigging, the safety, the clean up. There’s none of that with digital. Add it in post and you are good to go. There’s way more control with digital. Far more safety.  

Imagine blowing a take during the final big shootout of Django Unchained? Those were legit blood squibs. And the room’s walls are painted red. The clean up to start again? Hours. That’s a lot of $. 

But for some reason, unless there’s an example I don’t know about, I haven’t seen CGI replicate what a blood squib does. With CGI you get the red mist, but I don’t see the chunks or clothing. There’s a look to squib hits. And I’m sure cgi maybe could get it exact if they really tried, but I don’t think it’s treated as seriously or something important enough to spend precious R&D time on. 

But I also think squibs affect the actors performance. Think of Al Pacino in Scarface. You feel those bullet hits and his body reacts to them. There’s a physical reaction the actors have. When you watch John Wick and John is blasting these guys left, right and centre, you don’t see the actors reacting to them too much. And look I love those movies. But the bullet hits don’t have much of an impact. It’s not visceral. 


 Of course digital makes it easier to remove for ratings. Look at Die Hard 4. Released as PG13 and got an unrated cut for dvd. They added the blood in digitally and it looks awful.  Same many of the “unrated” cuts of movies that originally had PG13 ratings. Awful blood hits. It’s like they all use the same digital file to render the blood. 

 So you can see why it’s dying. For a filmmaker to use legit blood squibs in today’s filmmaking world? I feel that needs to be celebrated. Because everything is going against you. Time, money, and yes safety. To set off a blood pack is requires a small explosive charge. They can hurt.

When I watch John Wick 1-4, or the Deadpool movies, I’m hoping for some legit blood squib action. 

So. In celebration of practical blood squibs, What are your favourite blood hits in cinema? I already mentioned Django Unchained. What else? 

Bad Boys 2 has some great squib work. In the opening scene especially. 

Predator 1 & 2? Jesse Ventura’s death is *chefs kiss*. Total Recall has some beauties.

movies,1k4sfzb,Free Solo (2018) is NERVE-WRACKING,"Quite possibly the most nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat documentary I've ever watched in my life. My palms were sweaty for like, 90% of the runtime. The way each climb is shot by the filmmakers Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Vasarhelyi can only be described as epic. The grand scale of Alex Honnold's achievement is presented perfectly by the camera work, from the wide angle shots that frame him dwarfed by the massive wall of death he's climbing, to the tight close-ups of his fingers and feet digging into the rock face. It doubles as both an account of a monumental feat in rock climbing and human endurance, and a character profile about the kind of person that is willing to put his life on the line in the pursuit of perfection. Alex comes across as equally fucking crazy and inspiring. God bless his wife, she's the real hero for having the patience and compassion to deal with this guy's insanity.

movies,1jwzgxi,"After all these years, I finally watched Grave of the Fireflies… and I’m broken.","I went into *Grave of the Fireflies* completely clueless , I had no idea what to expect. But by the time the movie ended, only one thought kept echoing in my mind:

**“Whoever starts the war, no matter who wins or loses, the ones who truly suffer are the people just trying to survive it.”**

The pain, the sorrow, the daily struggle of those living through wartime…it’s unmatchable. Unless you've lived it, you can never truly understand it. And I was in tears by the end.

I came across some online discussions where people were blaming Seita, the brother, saying his pride got them killed. But honestly? I don't agree. During a war, everyone is pushed to the edge , there’s food scarcity, fear of sudden death, bombing raids. Every morning, you wake up wondering if you’ll live to see another day. In that kind of world, the mind doesn't function normally.

Even the aunt, who many view as cruel, was also a victim of the war. You could see how it was mentally breaking her. Seita and Setsuko were just children. Seita had just lost his mother, had no contact with his father or relatives, and on top of that, he had a little sister to protect. How is a child supposed to carry all that?

People say it was pride...but if it was, would he have risked stealing food again and again, even after getting beaten, just to feed his sister? That’s not pride. That’s pure, desperate love. He didn’t have an adult to guide him. He was just a boy, doing the best he could in a world that had collapsed around him.

This movie doesn’t draw a line between good and bad—it shows how **unfair** war is to everyone. And I think this is the **saddest movie I’ve ever seen in my life**. I don’t want to watch it again... but I truly believe *everyone*, especially our generation, needs to see it **at least once**. You’ll learn something that no book or lecture can teach.

Also, that background music , Absolutely unforgettable. And that fireflies scene... the red glow, Seita and Setsuko sitting together on the bench in the night ,that image is forever engraved in my heart.

This movie... it’s more than a story. It’s an experience. And I’ll never forget it.",395,0.76,189,2025-04-11 20:16:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jwzgxi/after_all_these_years_i_finally_watched_grave_of/,Kudoshinichi0007

movies,1jqnwid,2024 hot take: Robbie Williams biopic (Better Man) is much much better than Bob Dylan’s biopic (Complete Unknown),"As the title suggests, Better Man is a far superior movie.

The music integrated incredibly well, to the point where the story built into the songs and I felt the plot transcend into the lyrics. The monkey “bit” works perfectly to support underlying message and somehow did not detract from visual. Not to mention his sober portrayal of himself as a self aggrandizing, selfish, drug addicted, and fame obsessed person. Did not try to make excuses for himself yet I came out a fan. 

Complete Unknown was ok and predictable. Better Man deserves the Oscar noms.

[DEADLINE - Pete Hammond](https://deadline.com/2025/04/the-amateur-review-rami-malek-gripping-global-spy-thriller-bourne-for-computer-nerds-1236362892/)

>Production values are top notch, with a shout out to the special effects team for a spectaular set piece involving a pool collapse in Berlin that serves as the highlight of the action sequences. The screenplay by Ken Nolan and Gary Spinelli tries its best to avoid the cliches of the overworked spy genre and manages to help create a worthy character for Malek to run with, maybe not as fast as Jason Bourne, but no less memorable.

[Variety - Owen Gleiberman](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/the-amateur-review-rami-malek-1236362272/)

>This is the third thriller that Rami Malek has made since becoming a star in “Bohemian Rhapsody,” and it nudges his tense, twitchy moodiness even closer to the center of his brand. He’s the right actor to play a digital geek turned mindhunter; those eyes of his glare like lasers. Mostly, though, Malek plays out his methodical mission of vengeance as if it were something almost theoretical. The conceit of “The Amateur” — that Charlie must do all this himself — remains, at heart, a conceit. That’s why the movie is okay but never, you know, killer.

>*The Amateur* isn’t a bad movie from a technical perspective. Despite some misjudged shaky cam, it’s well-shot and edited in a way that makes its 2-hour runtime move along briskly.

For me its AVP Requiem.

And i'll tell you why.

Yes, maybe the lighting was bad but i was watching it on my PC so i never experienced the theater viewing, but i think all of the characters were well characterized, their dynamics well explored. I've heard people complain that we never hear what the main character did to go to jail or why he was friends with the sherrif, but i honestly think there's nothing wrong with that, we don't need to know, the movie does a great job of simply showing that although this guy has a rough past, he very clearly has a very very long relationship with the sherrif, by him getting home from jail it shows him as being bold.

The predalien and the aliens in the movie were extremely intimidating, it seemed like all of the characters, except for Wolf, were completely powerless. The predalien looked awesome as well, so that's a plus.

The movie is also EXTREMELY ballsy in it's edginess, i can't think of many other cheesy action movies for mainstream audiences that kill children and has pregnant women die in horrific ways. Not to mention the attractive love interest being absolutely massacred? I can't think of a single one of the copy-cat summer blockbusters that did that.

It's one of my favorite Alien/Predator movies, maybe a tier below, well, Alien and Predator lol

movies,1jlu0ts,What is a small scene in an otherwise less than critically acclaimed movie that is just amazing and has always stuck with you.,"For me, it is a scene in the movie ""Vision Quest"" from the 80's   Not a bad movie by any stretch (I love it) but it's not exactly on the level of the Godfather.   But this one scene, where the main character's coworker/boss explains why he is taking the night off to come see the main character wrestle in the big match... it could have been done by Brando or Pacino or so many... it's that good of a scene by itself if you ask me.

Begin edit:  I have never read any of the books. I totally understand all the comments respecting the books. I have not read any of them. My observation on the first movie stands by itself in a vacuum. End edit


I'm not a huge Tom Cruise fan, he's done some good films, shadowed by his involvement with Scientology, but whatever. He's a decent actor.

I was channel surfing and came across this first Jack Reacher movie. So, first of all, I don't understand the criticism that he wasn't this huge muscle-bound macho guy. He played the role well and was a good fit for it, I thought.

Most of all, holy Hell! This was a great movie. A solid thriller with a well-thought mystery behind the premise. There was enough action to keep it moving along, without going over the top, and only one car chase scene, which had a funny conclusion. That's Pittsburgh for you!

I'd watch it again and if you haven't, it's worthwhile.",292,0.77,258,2025-03-25 01:08:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jj7jdz/jack_reacher_2012/,mildOrWILD65

Yet, he's never played a role that would have made him a serious candidate for an Oscar and that is pretty shocking in my opinion.

movies,1jxcf3q,Everest (2015) is a surprisingly well crafted movie,"Found it on Netflix and just finished watching, don’t remember seeing anything about it when it came out.

Stars Jason Clarke, Josh Brolin and Jake Gyllenhaal. They had top billing for obvious reasons, Brolin and Gyllenhaal are what attracted me to it, but there’s a lot of actors sharing the screen and they’re all top notch in this movie.

I decided to watch it despite thinking to myself “okay, this is gonna be one of those movies that I can go ahead and play in my mind with probably 70% accuracy.” I thought it was gonna be superficial and formulaic - it was not.

It’s based on a true story of a disaster on Mt Everest in 1996. Won’t go into more detail than that to avoid spoilers.

I doubt the movie would blow anybody’s mind but it’s just a really good, solid film. There’s a lot of human drama that felt very genuine to me, no melodrama. No cheesy dialogue. No caricatures. No actors hamming it up or overacting, in my opinion. No major genre cliches that I can recall. In fact I feel that it’s the type of movie that kinda defies genre, although you could categorize the themes well enough.

Plot wise I didn’t find it predictable at all. If you’re already familiar with the story then I think you’ll find that the events aren’t portrayed predictably. No cheap thrills or cheap sentiment, just real ones. It made me feel shit.

The cinematography is great, there’s a lot of astounding shots of the mountain and surrounding environment. I don’t know if it was IMAX, but I’d have to assume it was because of some of the photography that just screams IMAX. Watch it on your biggest screen

Long story short, I was expecting to accept a certain degree of eye rolling bullshit but there was none to be found. Really solid movie, it impressed me a lot.",286,0.91,121,2025-04-12 08:10:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jxcf3q/everest_2015_is_a_surprisingly_well_crafted_movie/,jaguarp80

movies,1jv5cbb,"""Mortal Kombat"" (1995) is 90s nostalgia. A fun, martial arts movie that works. Robin Shou was a star, Johnny Cage bad ass and Christophe Lambert as Lord Raiden. It still holds up.","There was criticism back then that the movie wasn't gory but I didn't mind because I feel the movie works so well as a martial arts meets Enter the Dragon kind of movie that it doesn't matter. 

Sub-Zero is still a cool villain. I thought the fights were well-choregraphed. I thought Robin Shou was a strong male lead as Liu Kang and I'm even surprised MK didn't lead him into being a martial arts movie star. I thought Linden Ashby was pretty good as Johnny Cage: handsome, witty and resourceful. 

Bridgette Wilson was okay as Sonya Blade. I found her believable in her quest for revenge and her fight scene with Kano worked. I do feel her subplot was quickly rushed out. The one thing I liked about the new MK was that it gave us more Kano and Sonya. 

Christophe Lambert was pretty good as Raiden and I loved Cary Hirowuri-Tagawa as Shang Tsung, reverential and evil until he drops the cloak and he's all buffed up and menacing.
