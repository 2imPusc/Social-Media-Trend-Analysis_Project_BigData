If you eat mostly local or cook - comfortably - would be about 6mil (200€) per month. That leaves you with a spare 225€. Don't forget transportation.

You can cut everything by 2 if you want to live miserably. And it's substantially cheaper if you don't live in the social centers of HCMC or - even better - live in other cities, like up to 30% cheapers.

The problem is many dog owners have no manner or consideration for others, as they let the dog poops on the street without cleaning after them, no leash no muzzle when going out on walk which results in their dog scaring others or attacking others. Just be a decent owner and nobody will bat an eye.


Some appartments ban pets, so you will need to find house or pet friendly appartment, just like everywhere else. ",21,2025-04-17 04:18:46,RealDecentHumanBeing
VietNam,1k140pa,mnjbtfu,"Move to HCMC and live in District 7, Phu My Hung residential area. 

On the weekends there are huge dog owner meets in the parks. Dogs on leash being walked all morning and evenings by locals and foreigners.",4,2025-04-17 05:10:09,accidents_happen88
VietNam,1k140pa,mnjjkus,"I’m a dog owner here and have been apart of the small foreigner dog community here for some time now.  Your worries are correct and you shouldn’t trust people here saying “it’s not bad, everyone has dogs”.  This is generally a bad place for dogs if you actually care about their quality of life.  There are no animal rights in this country and dogs are generally seen by the public and government alike as disposable accessories/second class citizens.  Dog poisonings and kidnappings are real things that happen multiple times a year, absolutely not uncommon.  I’ve heard of cases where dogs were literally snatched off of the leash during a walk.  Theres little to no green space except for select parts of the cities and many of the green spaces are littered with trash and generally not somewhere I want to let my dog explore.  You can’t let your dog off leash and generally need to be on guard when walking your dog.  People are often scared shitless of dogs and even more so if your dog is big so expect to sometimes get wild reactions.  

I say this not to fearmonger, but so you understand that these are legit risks and you do the proper research before bringing your dog here.  These are risks that CAN be mitigated and maybe even brought down to a very low risk but you need to be strategic in picking the area you live and how you go about walking your dog.  Phú Mỹ Hưng is generally great and I know many people who have happily raised their pets there for years with very little worry (though there still has been recorded dog nappings here).  Another option is living in a compound (like a gated community) in a house/villa.  This is generally the best option and gives you the most peace of mind but is going to be expensive if you’re trying to live in the city center.  Many people will tell you a lot of the high-rise serviced apartments are “pet-friendly” and i would more so say they’re generally “barely tolerating pets”.  99% of them will require you to muzzle your dog if it’s outside of your apartment and you’ll need to take the service elevator every time you take your dog for a walk.  Many of them view dogs as nuisances are rules are constantly changing as management receives complaints from residents and changes their mind on a daily basis.  Some dog breeds are banned in these buildings.  Generally a shit place to live if you want freedom with your dog.

Again, a lot of this depends on where you live.  You can find areas that are much safer and dog-friendly but you need to make sure you do proper research and scout the area yourself beforehand or else you WILL be miserable (pls trust me, I didn’t do enough research and and am now miserable with my dog).  In general I find the attitude around dogs here to be enough of a reason for me to not like having a dog here.  I prefer for my dog to have a ton of green space and for the risk of dog poisoning to be 0% rather than 0.003% or whatever it is here (pulling that out of my ass).  I’m planning to move to give my dog a better life where I can live without fear of shit like dog thieves.  That’s just me though, and I love my dog dearly — I know people here who are very happy with their dogs so it’s not impossible.  Just pls do your research beforehand.  Check out HCMC dog lovers on Facebook, you’ll find a plethora of info there.",3,2025-04-17 06:21:48,koopaooper

I found Da Lat and Nha Trang better suited for us, and helps if you find an apartment that tolerates dogs. It helps to have a small, non-shedding breed as those are the most popular there.

I think I would really recommend it to non-european located people to get a feeling how some european buildings look Like - at least the local Vietnamese Homestay told me that thats what most asian people go for. 
We didnt know much about it in advance. Went early Match at 9 in the morning. In Da Nang we had Sun, on top IT was cloudy. The Bridge hat White in the Back because of Clouds and even in the morning it was already crowded. We went Back down at around 14 oclock. It was packed at this time. We had to Queue for the way down for 40 min.

I was frustrated because I had plans in Hanoi that I missed, and I’m not even sure if my travel insurance will cover the hotel since the policy started the day of the flight. To make things worse, the airline only contacted me less than two hours before departure.

When I arrived in Ho Chi Minh, immigration was a mess and the connecting flight was leaving in an hour. An airline staff member told me if I missed it, they’d “sort something out”—not very reassuring. All of this happened in less than 24 hours, and I was left speechless.

I find the tones easy personally, and my listening skills (northern dialect) are quite decent, but I need to improve my spoken vocabulary range. 

First, learn the alphabet.  
Then, the tones.
Then, basic phrases and numbers. 
Then, develop your vocabulary.  
Grammar is the easiest part imo. 

Also, get to know your pronouns and how to greet so you show respect to others.

1. Start with Pronunciation: Vietnamese is a tonal language, meaning the meaning of a word changes depending on the tone used. There are six tones in Vietnamese, so getting familiar with how they sound is really important.

2.Take advantages of apps and tools: apps like LanguageCrush can help you pick up words easily.

3. Learn Basic Phrases: Begin by learning simple phrases like greetings, expressions of gratitude, and common questions: xin chào, tạm biệt, chúc may mắc ...

4. Learn the Vietnamese Alphabet: The Vietnamese alphabet uses the Latin script, so if you already know English, you'll recognize many letters.",2,2025-04-05 02:28:59,MrMr0595

That 0.1% of the time can be sand in the middle of a blind corner, a massive dumper truck coming opposite direction out of absolutely anywhere, crazy slippery wet asphalt if it rains, and overall local traffic in opposite direction being fully unexpected.

VietNam,1jysjd8,mn20987,"Some tips and tricks to survive SEA in general:

* NEVER take a taxi, particularly in the airport / train station / similar locations. You are going to be overcharged (if not straight-up kidnapped in some SEA countries) and you are going to be helpless unless you can speak the local languages very fluently. Book a Grab bike / car from the mobile app and pay via the app
* When you eat out, pay attention to the crowd. If you see many non-locals, you are in a tourist trap. If you see a middle-aged or older guy treating his big family, you are likely in a good spot. If all customers wear very modestly, no big family etc., you are probably in a good-value place, cheap and taste alright, but nothing to write home about.
* Unfortunately, Vietnam is not suitable for biking around cities. However, you can rent a scooter if you have a suitable license. Ask your hotel for a place to rent. This is generally not the cheapest but less hassle and definitely more secure.
* Drink mildly and avoid trouble. Remember, this is a region in which relatively few people speak English.
* Don't do anything related to ""redlight district"" (which is illegal in Vietnam btw). There are some nasty groups managing these kind of places in SEA, you obviously don't want anything to do with them.",3,2025-04-14 13:06:52,Capable-Package6835

- download grab app - fixed fare taxis like uber. Taxis are cheap in my experience 
- you need cash - check which atms are legit on google maps. I’d say it’s 50/50 in terms of paying by phone / cash. Use a debt card. 
- credit cards - expect 3-6% per transaction 
- coffee places - go to place where locals are, just walk and explore 
- restaurants / bars - lots of fake reviews on google maps. They ask customers / offer drinks for reviews. Ask on Reddit for ppls fav places.  
- tourist traps - it’s no different to other parts of the world but everyone will hard sell you and want money from you. Expect to be hustled. From the driver on commission to ppl in the shops. 
- traffic - ppl drive a bit crazy here, but I’m used to it and it’s comparable to India / Thailand / Philippines etc. you kinda have to walk out into the road and they go around you.

With those schmucks at the helm, we would have likely lost the country anyway when the Chinese inevitably invaded.

That being said I do feel a strong sense of repulsion when the war is portrayed as very much a simple black and white matter in Vietnam with the whole thing being overromanticised.

I think it’s worth celebrate that the bloodshed was ended, and the supposed blood bath against South Vietnamese who worked for the Thieu regime is wildly exaggerated to say the least. You can talk about the vigilantism or imprisonment, but there was no policy, official or implied green light, to kill anyone for their service to RVN after Saigon fell.

As to the future of the country, the best case scenario had the RVN survived would be like South Korea (which I highly doubt, more likely will go similarly to Thailand and the Philippines).

But myself as a native I think it's a day of reunification no matter how much the gov tries to spin it. Even if the current gov isnt a good one and is an oppressive authoritarian type of gov, I'm at least still glad in the end we still manage to unite and not care about sticking guns to eachother constantly like north and south korea.

Flying to Cambodia just for a single day is crazy. Including the  advised ""arrive 3-hours before departure"" at both airports it's like a 9 hour commute.

With such a short trip and large group, stick with to country. It really depends what you want to do and how you'd like to split up the trip.

HCM and surroundings could potentially fill up 3-4 days depending on what time of day you arrive on D1.

If it's afternoon, just stroll around and hit up a restaurant or two 

Day two, cultural/historical spots around the city, preferably with a hired van so you can all stay together.

Day three, a mekong delta tour which should be ok for the seniors.

Leaves you with 3 full days elsewhere, either take it easy at a resort and smaller beach town like Vung Tau, three hours from HCM.

Fly to Da Lat for a mountainous more nature type of retreat.

>A. CONNECTING FLIGHTS ON INTERNATIONAL JOURNEYS OF VIETJET

>1. Rules for international connecting flights

>Only applicable for international connecting itineraries between flights operated by VietJet through Noi Bai (Hanoi), Danang and Tan Son Nhat (Ho Chi Minh City) Airports.

>Only applicable for connecting flights with a maximum connecting time at the transfer airport within 24 hours, either on the same day or different days.

However, if you booked a whole packed tour for your entire trip through a 3rd party website the tickets will often be booked separately, creating two different itineraries for the Shanghai > HCM and again for the HCM > Jakarta flights.

Which Vietjet has a solution for as well,

>In case passengers have 2 international flights (eg SYD to SGN and SGN to DEL) operated by Vietjet with 2 separate tickets and want to be through-checked to the final destination, they can purchase a ""Connecting flight service"" at ""My Booking"" on website www.vietjetair.com, or directly purchase this service at the airport by providing 2 separate tickets to the check-in staff.

Then, definitely visit family fish sauce factory called Nuoc mam truyen thong Phu Quoc Huynh Khoa. 🐟

If you for any reason change money at the airport be vigilant they will try to short you.

When you are wandering around Sai gon never accept anything offered thinking its free or cheap always get a price first.

Finally use your head, if it wouldn’t fly or make sense at home it doesn’t here.

VietNam,1k0hfyt,mne377e,"1.) dont get scammed at the Airport. Tan son Nhat is a horrible horrible Airport, probably the worst one i've ever witnessed and you will be exhausted after flying in there and going out finally. DO NOT take one of the 12 Guys that will immediately approach you with taking you to the city for the best Deal. 

Go to the Grab pick up Spot. Book a Grab. Only get into the right Car with the correct license Plate. 

2.) avoid hanging out at Bui Vien walking street unless you're a 20y old Party Tourist that likes to Spend money on watered down Cocktails that cost Double the price. Its interesting to see this place though, atleast look at it, but hanging out there extensively, meh. 

3.) Go Shopping. Saigon is fantastic for local Brands and Shopping in General. 

4.) Go to little Hanoi egg Coffee near 23rd Park. They have a fantastic egg Coffee and breakfast. 

5.) visit the war Museum and Trust me on this one. I'm not into History really, but this place is the best Museum i've ever Seen. Go there. Actually read the stuff do not only look at Things. It is insanely interesting.

6.) Visit Landmark 81 at evening for an incredible View, inside and outside.

- everybody understands the north accent because this is the accent on TV

I'd recommend staying in the Old Quarter in Hanoi, a good amount of tourists are around there including lots of female travellers, and there's heaps to do and see - make sure you get egg coffee and the pho, it's next level tasty.

If it has the little hole in the center then the chances of it being safe are greater (but not fool-proof). I always avoid the house tra da for this reason. This also means the crudites (beansprouts, herbs etc) are also at risk since it will be washed in tap water. Ask them to blanch it and you should be fine.

Ignore those realtors and keep searching. Post on various FB groups, check marketplace etc.

For that price you could even check Airbnb and message the host if they're available for a 3-month rental outside the platform. They're often cheaper in person.

Either way, always book a hotel/airbnb for a few days so you can ""shop"" around before settling for a multimonth agreement. Tip, if you have a place in mind, visit at night to check the noise in the area.",1,2025-04-22 02:45:20,paksiwhumba

Hue:  Bun Bo Hue (beef noodle soup), Banh canh (thick noodle soup), and their steamed dumplings like  Banh Loc Goi.

Da Nang:  Mi Quang (turmeric noodles with pork and shrimp), Banh Xeo Mien Trung (crepe with pork and shrimp), Banh trang cuon thit heo (pork belly spring rolls), and lots of fresh seafood dishes.

We had 3 nights in Da Nang including 1 day trip to Hoi An (I loved it, I would have liked to spend an extra day there so maybe 2 days/1 night?) Da Nang was ok but I didn't like it as much as other places we have visited (we came from the south and stayed in Can Tho, HCMC, Dalat and Nha Trang). 

We got the train to Hue from Da Nang which was an amazing experience, definitely recommend.  It's a very scenic route with great views, takes about 2.5 hours I think and is quite cheap. We stayed in Hue 3 nights, because we wanted to see more architecture etc. We spent 1 day visiting the tombs, and 1 day for the ancient citadel. We also visited the abandoned water park which was cool for photography. 

Personally I thought Hue was best for food out of the three, but it depends on your tastes. :) also try Huda beer if you get chance!",2,2025-04-22 09:18:07,tamerlayne
VietNam,1k4htrr,moaj3ae,"Hey, big foodie and Vietnamese here. Ignore Albertqwe’s advice, lol. Avoid HCMC, there is a new traffic law that makes traversing the city very hard if you’re only there for a short time. Also, the food in Saigon is honestly very touristy and has a sweeter palate even the locals don’t value. The city is known for broken rice and sweeter pho which is in pretty much every city internationally, I.e. that bowl of pho that you liked in California or Toronto is going to taste very similar to a bowl of pho in Saigon. If you really want to experience food in Vietnam, first know that each city In the south and in the north specializes in their own unique dishes. From your itinerary, I would recommend dishes to try from each area. Da Nang has been one of the most popular food destinations for all of my friends. Bánh xèo, Mì Quảng, Bún mắm are very famous dishes to try while you’re there but even the Bánh mì and the  Bún bò will taste great. Huế is special and is very famous for their take on Bún bò, which is why it’s internationally famous as Bún bò Huế. They have amazing other specialties in seafood specifically with shellfish, specifically with crab, shrimp, and clams so dishes like rice with clams and crab broth noodles are spiced with their shrimp paste. Hội An is really known as a trading port so anything shopping I’d really spend most of my time there! There are amazing restaurants in Hội An that specialize in snails and fish so be sure to try some too! Always stick to food recommendations by locals and you will find the hidden gems of Vietnam. I would spend more time in DN, Huế and Hội An in that order. At most 1-2 days in HCMC.",4,2025-04-21 17:56:49,pinaptran

Saigon:
- Definitely go at night if possible because that's a lot more fun—they have fountains/spouts in the ground that light up at night and dances and singing (uh maybe bring earplugs tho or be a decent distance away from the music lmao)
- Visit the lotus fountain
~~~requires a tiny bit of cash~~~eat desserts/foods at Bánh Mì Như Lan—you said you have no money but it's pretty affordable (also, since it's  a popular enough spot, I feel like they'll know how to serve people that don't speak Vietnamese)

Do the boat trip from Trang An which is a must rather than Tam Coc as vendors etc. aren't allowed there so it's more peaceful. Number 3 is through the longest cave. Don't attempt the climb at Hang Mua unless you're super fit. I managed thanks to my walking pole but it wasn't easy as some of the steps are so high and uneven. And dangerous in wet weather which it wasn't thankfully for us. Get a Grab to Trang An and back (and everywhere in fact). Bich Dong Pagoda is very nice as is Bai Dinh Pagoda although most buildings there are more recently constructed.  The advantage there is you can take golf style buggies from point to point if you buy the more expensive ticket.  The site is absolutely huge.  Can't comment on Mai Chau as only my daughter has been there twice.. to a cave rave which is a huge event so don't visit at that time!

VietNam,1k2fqqm,mnu5bfb,"Ok, here's how I do it if I plan to go without a rice cooker: 


1. Pre-wash rice until water is about 50% clear of starch. 


2. Finger method for amount of water to add. (Honestly, you can go slightly over with the pot method because of Step 4.)


3. Put on high heat and come to boil with lid off (to prevent overflow). Continue to stir frequently to prevent sticking/burning to the bottom.


4. Continue to keep on high and stir until water has about 85% boiled off. The rice in the pot should be plump, look like ""dry"" congee, and continue to produce bubbles. When you stir the rice, it takes 1-2 sec for the rice to return to its previous shape. (E.g. you can see the after effects of how you stir your rice for a brief sec.) You can continue to cook the water down if you like your rice dry. I personally like soft rice, so I'll turn the heat down to low here and pop the lid on.


5. Keep on low for several minutes. I kinda eyeball it here. Maybe 8-10 min? I just pop the lid off, fluff the rice, and if it has the consistency I like, I turn off the heat and let it settle on its own with the heat on until I'm ready to serve.

So if you stick to Indian cuisine, maybe Vietnam is not that foodily friendly compared to Singapore or Malaysia. 

The Vietnamese doesn't hide their body shaming attitude. If someone is over weight, they'll say that someone is fat. If someone smells, they will take some steps away. But Vietnamese are not expert in culture and race, we can never tell an Indian from a Pakistan or Bangladesh or a Singaporean of Indian decend. And we have nothing against India or Indian people. Previously lots of Indian movies are shown on TV where the actors dance all the time even during the fighting which is a good image. Now that at my beach in Danang, maybe half of the foreigners I meet are Indian.  
  
So you'd have no worry about your landlord.

VietNam,1jmildh,mkuzdg3,"hi!! so happy to help! i'm in Ninh Binh right now staying at a WONDERFUL hotel called Ninh Binh Royal Homestay in Trang An.

Ninh Binh city itself isn't where you'd want to stay — it's between Tam Coc (a bit more developed tourist town) or Trang An (more rural). Both have their pros and cons depending on what you're looking for.

Yesterday, we did the Mua Cave hike and the views were phenomenal. I've been to Lauterbrunnen and Palawan and this place is up there with those IMO.  

The hike 500 steps up and can get brutal at times. Stoned edged stairs that can get super steep and sketchy but you see older and younger people do it and it motivates ya. Theres rest points and even small stands selling water. 

Keep in mind that while Ninh Binh is still less touristy than many places, it is growing in popularity, especially in Asia, so i definitely suggest arriving to anything early.

We heard great things about the Trang An tour — route 3, specifically and we chose it and loved every second. It has the longest cave (about 1km and it was just incredible!!!) The whole boat tour was about 2 hours and we arrived around 8:30am just in time to beat the crowd. If you can arrive earlier, even better! We just arrived early and bought our tickets there. $10 a person for 4 people total on a boat! They pair you with others if you are just 1 or 2 or a private tour is around $50, I believe.

Getting in and out of the boat can be challenging and a bit scary at first for anyone with disabilities but it depends on the mobility issue. I personally think it's worth it! we also love our hotel. here to help if you need any more help planning your trip! I've been to Da Nang, Hoi An and Hanoi tmrw!

I saw a youtuber say that if you do 1 boat tour he doesn't feel like the other is necessary since it's about the same views. I'd say stay overnight or two if possible. It's such a nice getaway and so peaceful, especially in Trang An.",1,2025-04-01 14:25:54,Ok-Environment-9839

The French Far-East Expeditionary Corps, to my knowledge, did not have its own flag.

The challenge you have in this case is the fact that it is now a probate issue, you aren't the original account holder and thus, you need to demostrate a lot more than he, as the account holder and income earner would have to.

For the document authentication, really, you want to be talking with both HSBC in Vietnam and the US - they might be able to point you better in the right direction.  Also, HSBC Vietnam is required to follow the State Bank of Vietnam rules (these are published in English \[translated\] online - so be sure to ask the bank for the specific law / circular if they are stating they cannot do something) and as a FDI Bank typically is quite strict (to avoid less prying eyes from regulators) compared to a more local bank.

In terms of companies that specalise in this, then other than the bank, you probably want to reach out to a local (with international experience) law firm - the question then becomes, is the value of the account worth it.

\[Not a Recommendation\] [https://phong-partners.com/](https://phong-partners.com/) (through a quick Google Search), or check with the US Embassy as they will have a list of law firms.

Law firms which have mixed personal, civil and commerical experience might be the best option since a lot of the process in respect to capital control rules will be similar regardless of personal vs. corporate.

Law firms here vary widely from anywhere from 25 USD / hour to 1,000 USD / hour - so shop around, most will be happy to do a free consultation, check to make sure they have experience in handling cases like yours and with US procedures.

Honestly, with the right paperwork, it isn't too difficult to do a bank transfer, I think most of the issue stems from the US Embassy not certifying documents locally.",2,2025-03-25 01:41:35,Ancient_Wait_8788

Ninh Kieu is the district in that city

Hung Loi is the district ward. You are lucky yours is named. Mine is just Phuong and a number.

There are no Streets named 20/4 but there is one called 30/4 so I assume you wrote that one down wrong. You also forgot the D. for Duong which means Street. The streets are usually names of historic heroes sometimes something different and in this case it is Reunification Day/Liberation Day. That's what all the parade training is for.

(Here would now come alley if there is one, short H or Hem. If you look to the north you could see some places that are in a lot in an alley, think of it as a side street to a main street)

F is your lot, like a block of housings. I can't find a F but there is a 28- If you tried to scramble your address you really should tell us so we can actually help you. It's not an alley but a block. If you look up and down that block you will see they will most likely all be Number + F. Exception for those homes that existed there before they assigned a lot. Usually this happens because that place long ago used to be a field or small settlement and the city grew around it. The farmer then sells off their farm and only keeps one place with the original address.

And at last the house number (followed by the apartment complex name and apartment number if you were in a multi-rise).

My address looks like something like this: S112 T10, \[name of a mall\], H129, 123C, street name \[historic figure\], P5, Q5, HCM.

Which means Apartment Number (So) 112, Floor (Tang) 10, \[mall name\] because same as apartment complex name, alley (Hem) 129, house number 123 in Block C of street \[historic figure\], Ward (Phuong) 5, District (Quan) 5, Ho Chi Minh City.

You shorten it to 112/10 \[mall name\] \]129/123C, \[Historic figure\] P5/Q5 HCM.

You have a big plot of land. Many immigrants from the countryside are looking to buy a house to start a life in the city. You want to sell it, but not many people can afford. So you split it into several smaller plots and sell it.

You see how it's a born out of necessity thing? If people can afford it they'd buy a mansion, but most can't, so they're stuck with those tube houses. Apartment buldings are gradually replacing tube houses though.

VietNam,1k54m92,mofg4ck,"The front side of the house with access to the street is the most valuable aspect of the land.

A plot of land with access to the street is often multiple times more valuable than a plot of land that can only access an alley. It is also the ""storefront"", so for business purpose, the wider the storefront, the better business prospect of the plot of land, this much is obvious. So there were period where taxation is base on how wide the front is, instead of the total area.

Of course, everyone want a plot of land with wide and big front, obviously, but they are gonna be more expensive, so if you cant afford a plot with big front, then you at least want a plot of land with ""some"" front.

So the reason lots of land in Vietnam is ""tube shape"" is because people prefer land with some front, or access to the main street.

So when dividing land, you often divide it down the fronts,, thus the tube shape.

In Short:

People here place huge importance on the front side of the house, or ""mặt tiền"". Everyone want a piece of ""mặt tiền"", so overtime, the front got narrow, to get as many plots as possible to have a street facing front, or ""mặt tiền"".",4,2025-04-22 13:37:45,Sedaku
VietNam,1k54m92,mofkgtn,"Based on the previous comments, the root of this problem is to the department of planning (or Urbanisation or similar). Those who cut lands. Instead of cutting small lots with houses back to back with principal and secondary roads, and acceptable front page, they instead tend to minimize the area of streets, and have alleys instead to gain more land.",2,2025-04-22 14:01:27,Worth_Ab8225
VietNam,1k54m92,mof3ewz,"For the same area of land, the larger its front side is, the more expensive it is. In some cases 10x10 is more expensive than 5x25.",1,2025-04-22 12:20:09,thg011093
VietNam,1k54m92,mof8thy,"5x20 has basically become the standard land now ask over Vietnam. New lands created by cities all have this format. 

For what I understand, main reason is because everybody want to have a land (no apartment), and everybody want to be on the road (no cul-de-sac). So the only way to sarisfy everybody in cities is to sell narrow lands. And vietnamese's sharp taste for architecture isn't bothered by such an inconvenient format. They don't like windows anyways, they want rooms after rooms.

Some high standard neighborhood provide lands with better format to build rich people house. Seen some very nice architect houses during my prospections.",1,2025-04-22 12:54:42,arllt89

VietNam,1k4xgyi,modo1vz,"I did the business path. It’s long and costly and requires many steps and help from a local (a friend), as well as a an accountant/agent to help you process the documentation and registration. You’ll need to register with the tax department, submit your tax, pay your tax, etc. You’ll also need around $100-150k USD as your investment into the business (capital to start the business).

For countries that offer an evisa, you can just submit the required info online. I’m not 100% sure if they offer that for Colombians. If the evisa is not an option you would need to contact the Japanese embassy in Vietnam for info, and head to their office to make your application and submit the required documentation. 

Google the Japanese embassy in whichever city you’re in and give them a call and they will advise you exactly what you need.",1,2025-04-22 03:44:32,DurbanPoizyn
