1jrdz46,reddit,Live Asteroid Event Tracking with NASA API Integration,"Take command of your own virtual spy satellite with the Sentinel Spy Satellite Simulator - NASA API Edition! This interactive Python-based simulation puts you in the pilot’s seat of a high-tech orbital observatory, blending real-time NASA data with an immersive ASCII art experience. Powered by NASA’s open APIs (EPIC and NeoWs), this tool fetches live Earth imagery coordinates and asteroid proximity alerts, merging them seamlessly into a dynamic satellite control interface.

What It Does: • Real-Time NASA Data: Pulls live telemetry from NASA’s EPIC API (Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera) for authentic latitude,

longitude, and timestamps, plus NeoWs API for near-Earth object events. • Interactive Simulation: Control your satellite with real-time commands—scan sectors, transmit data, or repair systems—via intuitive keypress controls (S, D, C, T, R, Q). • Dynamic Events: Encounter randomized space hazards like debris fields or asteroid alerts (with real NEO data), requiring quick decisions to evade or intercept. • ASCII Art Display: Watch your satellite animate in retro-style ASCII art, with visual states reflecting health, scanning, transmitting, or repairs. • Persistent State: Tracks your satellite’s health, solar power, data collected, and missions completed, saved between sessions.

Features:

• NASA API Integration: Uses your NASA API key (or the included demo key) to fetch real data, with robust fallback to simulated telemetry if NASA’s servers are offline (e.g., during rare 503 errors).

• Sound Effects: Optional Pygame audio for boot-up, events, scans, and transmissions (requires sound files: boot.wav, event.wav, scan.wav, transmit.wav).

• Cross-Platform: Runs on Windows, macOS, or Linux with Python 3.x, requests, pygame, and colorama libraries.

• Customizable: Adjust frame speed, log missions to satellite\_log.txt, and tweak solar power regeneration rates.

• Educational & Fun: Perfect for space enthusiasts, coders, or educators wanting to explore NASA data interactively.

How to Use:

1.  Install Python and required libraries (pip install requests pygame colorama). 
2. Add your NASA API key (get one free at api.nasa.gov) or use the fallback mode.
3. Run the script, by putting satellite\_animation.py on desktop then run in terminal cd \~/Desktop hit enter then run python3 satellite\_animation.py

Whether you’re a developer curious about APIs, a space geek dreaming of orbit, or a creator looking for a unique project, this simulator delivers an out-of-this-world experience. Download now and launch your satellite into the cosmos!

Note: Includes full source code (Python) and setup instructions. Sound files sold separately or create your own.

1jrbdqn,reddit,Programming my e-commerce app to send custom metrics [OpenTelemetry],"I've been a user of default/ infra metrics for a while. Recently, for work, I  started playing with custom metrics when I was trying to wrap my head around OpenTelemetry. Used a simple e-commerce app to experiment and play around. 

Couple of insights,  
  
\- Ability to get tailored data. For example, number of users who leave mid-checkout, average cart-size at a point in time.  
  
\- I worked with Flask, and instrumenting it was a smooth process. Used the `opentelemetry-sdk` and `opentelemetry-api` to manually instrument the Flask app. While OpenTelemetry does provide auto-instrumentation for Flask, I needed custom metric generation inside business logic so opted for manual setup.  
  
\- I used SigNoz for visualisation, which doesn't charge extra for custom metrics, which was different from some other platforms. 

I've noted my findings in a blog and some examples \[with code\], give it a read, if you guys also use custom metrics or have plans to try it out!  
  
\[Disclaimer - I work at SigNoz\]  
  
It'd also be cool, if you can tell me how you have implemented custom metrics for any project/ work?

1jo3lnz,reddit,Lessons from Rollbar on how to improve (10x to 20x faster) large dataset query speeds with Clickhouse and mySQL,"At Rollbar, we recently completed a significant overhaul of our Item Search backend. The previous system faced performance limitations and constraints on search capabilities. This post details the technical challenges, the architectural changes we implemented, and the resulting performance gains.

Overhauling a core feature like search is a significant undertaking. By analyzing bottlenecks and applying specialized data stores (optimized MySQL for item data state, Clickhouse for occurrence data with real-time merge mappings), we dramatically improved search speed, capability, accuracy, and responsiveness for core workflows. These updates not only provide a much better user experience but also establish a more robust and scalable foundation for future enhancements to Rollbar's capabilities.

This initiative delivered substantial improvements:

* **Speed:** Overall search performance is typically 10x to 20x faster. Queries that previously timed out (>60s) now consistently return in roughly 1-2 seconds. Merging items now reflects in search results within seconds, not 20 minutes.
* **Capability:** Dozens of new occurrence fields are available for filtering and text matching. Custom key/value data is searchable.
* **Accuracy:** Time range filtering and sorting are now accurate, reflecting actual occurrences. Total occurrence counts and unique IP counts are accurate.
* **Reliability:** Query timeouts are drastically reduced.

I recently open-sourced a little repo I’ve been using that makes it easier to run **Puppeteer on AWS Lambda**. Thought it might help others building serverless scrapers or screenshot tools.

📦 GitHub: [https://github.com/geiger01/puppeteer-lambda](https://github.com/geiger01/puppeteer-lambda)

It’s a minimal setup with:

* Puppeteer bundled and ready to run inside Lambda
* `chrome-aws-lambda` support
* Simple example handler for extracting HTML

I use this setup in **my side projects**, and it’s worked well so far for handling headless Chromium tasks without managing servers.

1k5it2y,reddit,TargetJS: A Novel JavaScript UI Framework for Simplified Development and Enhanced User Experience,"I have always been drawn to the JavaScript literal object. It is expressive, compact, and readable, if only there was a way to execute it. But JavaScript didn’t guarantee property order for a long time, until ES2015, which finally made the order predictable. It also introduced the shorter method syntax. This made the object literal more powerful and even more compact.

This inspired the core idea behind TargetJS:

* Provide an internal wrapper (called ""targets"") for both properties and methods of the literal object.
* Execute the targets sequentially in the same order as the code is written, using the framework's execution cycle.
* Enable a functional pipeline between adjacent targets.
* Add lifecycles, looping, and timing to targets so they can execute or re-execute themselves when a condition or time is met. This also makes the functional pipeline even more powerful as we will see later.

That's the basic idea.

To make the framework suitable for front-end development, TargetJS allows CSS styles to be integrated into the same object as targets especially since CSS styles closely resemble JavaScript object literals. To enhance style property utility, we added value iteration, so we can animate styles easily.

**What does TargetJS solve?**

TargetJS addresses several common pain points in front-end development:

1. Complexity of Asynchronous Operations: TargetJS addresses this by providing a structured, synchronous, and predictable execution flow, allowing developers to avoid asynchronous operations altogether.
2. Scattered State Management: In TargetJS, state management is inherently handled through its core concept of Targets.
3. Boilerplate and Verbosity: TargetJS code is compact and follows a predictable execution flow. Method calls are not allowed, and loops and conditional statements are rarely needed.
4. Rigid Static Layer of HTML: TargetJS minimizes reliance on traditional HTML and CSS, allowing JavaScript to be the primary player, resulting in a better and more dynamic user experience.
5. Disjointed Development Workflow: Developers often juggle multiple tools and concepts (UI libraries, animation libraries, state managers, event handlers). TargetJS provides a *unified* solution, simplifying the learning curve and development process.
6. Difficult Animation Control: TargetJS makes animations first-class citizens.
7. Performance Bottlenecks with Large Lists: TargetJS optimizes rendering for large lists by using a tree structure that renders only the visible branches.

1jybljz,reddit,"Coding in MiniScript Feels Like Python or Lua – Simple, Clean, and Fun","I've been experimenting with [MiniScript](https://miniscript.org/) recently, and I have to say—it's surprisingly enjoyable. If you're into lightweight, clean scripting languages like Python or Lua, you'll probably feel right at home. The syntax is super minimal, and yet it’s powerful enough to build full games.

What really makes it shine is using it with [Mini Micro](https://miniscript.org/MiniMicro/) — a tiny virtual machine for making retro-style games. It genuinely feels like coding on an old-school computer from the 80s or 90s, but with modern comforts (like instant code reloads and visual feedback). Perfect for prototyping ideas or just having fun with game dev in a nostalgic way.

It’s honestly refreshing to work in such a small, focused environment. If you're tired of bloated engines or just want to mess around with a simpler toolset, I highly recommend checking it out. Also, you can use it for game jams!

Disclaimer: It's not self-promotion, [Miniscript](https://miniscript.org/) is made by Joe Strout, and I am just sharing my experience, its really fun :)

Anyone else tried it? Or have you used similar minimalist tools for game dev?

Some more game examples:

* OLTP vs. Batch Processing
   * Online Transaction Processing (OLTP): Managed real-time user interactions via screens, developed using CICS and IMS.
   * Batch Processing: Handled bulk data operations, processing large files, datasets, and databases. Jobs were scheduled using JCL and managed by job schedulers.
* Data Interchange - Initially relied on batch transfers, FTP, and EDIs for machine-to-machine communication.
* Evolved into API gateways, XML messaging (XMS), and modern EDIs for faster, more dynamic data exchange.
* Reporting & Analytics - Early systems ingested large datasets into reporting databases, which later evolved into data warehouses and data marts for structured analytics.
* Security - Early mainframes used RACF (Resource Access Control Facility) for strong authentication and authorization .",2025-04-01 06:15:06,programming,programming,technology,Technology,[],0,0,0,,0.22,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2EAw1y-kWA,Lifecoach_411

1k6e202,reddit,Open source zero-code test runner built with LLM and MCP called Aethr,"I was digging around for a better way to run tests using AI in CI and I stumbled across this new open source project called [**Aethr**](https://github.com/autifyhq/aethr). Never heard of it before, but it’s super clean and does what I’ve been wanting from a test runner.

It has its own CLI and setup that feels way more lightweight than what I’ve dealt with before. Some cool stuff I noticed:

* Test are set up entirely through natural language
* Zero-config startup (just point it at your tests and go)
* Nice built-in parallelization without any extra config hell
* Designed to plug straight into CI/CD (works great with GitHub Actions so far)
* Can do some unique tests that without AI are either impossible or not worth the effort
* Heavily reduces maintenance and implementation costs

There are of course, limitations

* Some non-deterministic behavior
* As with any AI, depends on the quality of what you feed it
* No code to back up your tests

Anyway, if you’re dealing with flaky test setups, complex test cases or just want to try something new in the E2E testing space, this might be worth a look. I do think that this is the way software testing is headed. Natural language and prompt-based engineering. We’re headed toward a world where we describe test flows in plain English and let the AI tools run those tests.

1k3q0st,reddit,Swarm Debugging with MCP,"Everyone’s looking at MCP as a way to connect LLMs to tools.

What about connecting LLMs to other LLM agents?

I built Deebo, the first ever agent MCP server. Your coding agent can start a session with Deebo through MCP when it runs into a tricky bug, allowing it to offload tasks and work on something else while Deebo figures it out asynchronously.

Deebo works by spawning multiple subprocesses, each testing a different fix idea in its own Git branch. It uses any LLM to reason through the bug and returns logs, proposed fixes, and detailed explanations. The whole system runs on natural process isolation with zero shared state or concurrency management. Look through the code yourself, it’s super simple.

If you’re on Cline or Claude Desktop, installation is as simple as npx deebo-setup@latest.

[Here’s the repo. Take a look at the code!](https://github.com/snagasuri/deebo-prototype)

[Here’s a demo video of Deebo in action on a real codebase.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/141VdQ9DNOfnOpP_mmB0UPMr8cwAGrxKC/view?usp=sharing)

Deebo scales to real codebases too. Here, it launched 17 scenarios and [diagnosed a $100 bug bounty issue in Tinygrad.](https://github.com/snagasuri/deebo-prototype/blob/master/memory-bank/9bd38e9840d3/progress.md)

It's not your typical CRUD stack — this project uses a dialectic structure where each knowledge entry has a main point, a counterpoint, and a counterfactual. There's also a custom lexical network (think a dynamic ontology of stems and familiar terms) and experimental logic layers inspired by mathematical structures.**

I've just published a deep-dive comparing this approach to conventional best practices — especially Stanford-style architecture, modularity, naming, and testability. I’m not rejecting best practices — I value it  — but this system takes a more experimental, recursive approach and I’d love critical, thoughtful feedback from devs who think about structure, semantics, and system design.

If this sounds interesting, the article is here: [The Longer Version](https://seriace.substack.com/p/analysis-of-seriaces-symbolic-scroll)

I know the system might seem overengineered or even eccentric, but it wasn’t built to be clever — it was built to model relationships between ideas in ways that flat logic sometimes misses. That said, I’m still looking for collaborators who can help refine it, simplify parts, and connect it back to more standard tooling. If you’ve worked on DSLs, symbolic reasoning, recursive data, or you’re just into bending the usual paradigms — would love your take.

1jwegdm,reddit,How To Solve The Dual Write Problem in Distributed Systems?,"# Understanding the Dual Write Problem

In a microservice architecture, services often need to update their database and communicate state changes to other services via events. This leads to the **dual write problem**: performing two separate writes (one to the database, one to the message broker) without atomic guarantees. If either operation fails, the system becomes inconsistent.

For example, imagine a payment service that processes a money transfer via a REST API. After saving the transaction to its database, it must emit a *TransferCompleted* event to notify the credit service to update a customer’s credit offer.

If the database write succeeds but the event publish fails (or vice versa), the two services fall out of sync. The payment service thinks the transfer occurred, but the credit service never updates the offer.

This article’ll explore strategies to solve the dual write problem, including the **Transactional Outbox, Event Sourcing, and Listen-to-Yourself.**

For each solution, we’ll analyze how it works (with diagrams), its advantages, and disadvantages. There’s no one-size-fits-all answer — each approach involves trade-offs in consistency, complexity, and performance.

By the end, you’ll understand how to choose the right solution for your system’s requirements.",2025-04-11 01:37:32,programming,programming,technology,Technology,[],0,0,8,,0.44,https://medium.com/@lucas.rj.fernandes/1744cb7b08ae,Nervous-Staff3364

1jlygi7,reddit,"Rust-like Result<T, E> for TypeScript? Check out rustify!","Hey devs,

Made a small library, rustify, bringing Rust's Result<T, E> (Ok/Err) pattern to TypeScript.

If you're tired of lots of try/catch or null checks for errors, this might help make things clearer.

Quick Example:

    import { Ok, Err, wrapInResult } from ""@ghaerdi/rustify""; // Wrap something that throws, like JSON.parse
    
    const safeParse = wrapInResult(JSON.parse);
    const result = safeParse('{""hello"": ""world""}'); // Ok({ hello: 'world' })
    console.log(result.unwrapOr({})); // -> { hello: 'world' }
    const badResult = safeParse('{invalid'); // Err(...)
    if (badResult.isErr()) {
      console.error(""Parse failed:"", badResult.err());
    }

Handles success/failure explicitly and is type-safe.

You can install via npm/jsr: @ghaerdi/rustify

Feedback welcome!

I recently put together a deep-dive analysis on what’s happening in the programming world right now — and honestly, it’s one of the most turbulent times I’ve seen in over 7 years in the industry.

Some key points I cover:

* The ongoing wave of layoffs and why it’s *still* happening in 2025
* How AI tools (Copilot, GPT-4.5, Claude 3, Gemini Ultra) are automating more coding tasks — and what that means for programmers
* The paradox of layoffs *and* a skills shortage, especially in AI, security, and cloud
* Why the demand is shifting from routine coding to architecture, integration, and AI literacy
* Emerging roles like AI Ops, prompt engineering, and AI governance
* The impact on both junior and senior devs, and how to adapt

I tried to make it a no-BS, realistic look at the challenges *and* opportunities ahead.

1k3e0ax,reddit,Model Context Protocol - Exhaustively Explained,"Hey Redditors 👋,



I recently published a deep-dive technical blog on the Model Context Protocol (MCP)—a rising open standard introduced by Anthropic to let AI agents interact with external tools, data sources, and systems in a consistent and secure way.



🧠 What is MCP, in a nutshell? Think of it as the USB-C for AI agents. It allows LLMs to interact with real-world systems (APIs, files, databases, SaaS apps) using a common protocol that supports context fetching, tool usage, and secure operation. MCP removes the need for M×N integrations by standardizing the interface.



📘 The Blog Covers:



What is MCP and why it matters for AI

The M×N problem vs M+N elegance

Client-server architecture and message patterns (JSON-RPC 2.0)

Tools, Resources, and Prompts: the primitives

Transport options like HTTP + SSE

Security considerations (auth, isolation, rate limiting, audit logs)

Strategic adoption advice for enterprises



🧑‍💻 I also built a working demo on GitHub, using:



FastAPI MCP server exposing a sample tool via JSON-RPC

SSE endpoint to simulate real-time event streaming

Python client that lists and invokes tools via MCP



🔗 Read the blog: [https://srivatssan.medium.com/model-context-protocol-exhaustively-explained-f5a30a87a3ff?sk=1b971265640303c66b04377371c82102](https://srivatssan.medium.com/model-context-protocol-exhaustively-explained-f5a30a87a3ff?sk=1b971265640303c66b04377371c82102)

🔗 GitHub demo: [https://github.com/srivatssan/MCP-Demo](https://github.com/srivatssan/MCP-Demo)



🙏 What I'm Looking For:

I'm looking for feedback, improvements, and ideas from:



Architects implementing GenAI in production

Engineers working with agents, tools, or LangChain

AI security folks thinking about safe LLM integrations

Devs curious about protocol design for agent frameworks



I would really appreciate a review from folks who think critically about architecture, protocol interoperability, or just love breaking down new standards.

I am not someone who is lucky enough to work on frontier technologies. I try my best to catch up with evolution and share my learning with others who may not have the time I spent to learn the subject.

1jlbct1,reddit,Why do Vietnamese have different chess rules than the rest of the world?,"My kids and I play chess. We follow the international rules. Sometimes they play chess at school with their friends. A few years ago my kids told me that the kids at school play with different rules. I haven't bothered learning the Vietnamese rules but my kids have explained a couple of them to me. For example, you don't trap the king (as you do in international rules), you capture it (ie, removing it from the board). You don't say ""check"" when you put the opponent's king into check. If you don't realize you are in check and you try to move another piece (that doesn't block the check), it is a mistake/error and you can only make a couple of such errors without losing the game. Some really weird rules that I figured the school kids made up, because they are kids and kids do weird/dumb things sometimes.

But.... today I learned that there is a teacher at their school who is teaching them all chess. There's a city-wide tournament coming up and this teacher is the official teacher/coach for the school. And he's teaching them these same Vietnamese rules, not the international rules accepted by FIDE. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIDE)

It seems pretty silly to teach the kids a different set of rules. What if they did this with football? It would make Vietnamese players/teams totally unable to compete internationally. Well, that's what they're doing by teaching the kids the wrong chess rules.

1k4htrr,reddit,"How many days do I need each in Da Nang, Hue and Hoi An (and elsewhere?) with a food focus?","I'm planning a first-ever visit (solo) to Vietnam and looking at central Vietnam for 7-10 days. My main focus is on the food, ""grazing"" as much as I can throughout each day and hopefully filling in the ""in-between"" time with interesting things to do. I like food markets, hanging in coffee shops, observing people, learning about culture/history, etc. Definitely not a beach-dweller. Not big on big crowds and over-tourism, but can tolerate a bit for the sake of good food.

So, given this, how many days/nights would you recommend I spend each in Da Nang (will probably fly in to this airport), Hue and Hoi An? Or maybe you have recommendation of elsewhere to explore in central Vietnam? (I will likely go to Ho Chi Minh City from central VN to spend a couple of days before flying home.)

My sense (maybe wrong) is that Da Nang is the largest with lots of places to eat, but not much else besides the beach? Hoi An looks like an easy day-trip if I don't want to get hotels in all three cities, but despite it's touristic feel, maybe the food warrants additional time? Hue seems the most chill of the three places, so I was considering three nights unless that's too many.

I make rice exclusively on the stove because I have no room for a rice cooker. Whenever I follow the package directions or the mysterious finger method, I always end up with a wet, slimy mess. I’ve tried rinsing the crap out of it, using less water, cooking longer and/or at a higher temp, using different sizes of pans, etc. No matter what type of grain I use, my rice always comes out somehow both mushy and undercooked (???) and has the worst mouthfeel ever.

I have resorted to treating rice like I do pasta: Boil an excessive amount of salted water, add the rice, let it go until I’ve reached the desired texture, dump the water, then have the stuff sit while excess moisture evaporates. The result is  less than fantastic but it’s the only method that works for me.

1jw2j39,reddit,Should I Move to Vietnam,"Hello folks,

So I joined Reddit to ask this question. 

I work for a Swiss based consumer goods company in India. I got promoted and now they’re sending me to Vietnam , Ho Chi Minh City in a leadership position. My move date is on 5th of May this year and till now I haven’t been researching much about life as an indian in vietnam.

For a week or so I researched and my research on YouTube, this forum, and forums like trip advisor, travel fish, and VBF left me thinking if I as an indian should move there.

I realized that my country men and women don’t carry a good image in Vietnam, for reasons that I don’t find implausible, but nevertheless I am quite worried about unnecessary intense micro aggressions , starkly askances and most importantly social ostracization. There a ton of videos on YouTube that I saw recently where many Indians reported rude and disrespectful behavior from locals. I am not doing any blame or shame here, I am just sharing what I found.

A good friend of mine, who is an Indian, is a CFO for Unilever Vietnam, he too asked me to think twice before moving to Vietnam. His case is a bit different though, he lives in Singapore for 20 odd days in Vietnam and the rest of the 10 days in Vietnam.

Now the thing is that I wouldn’t have to navigate when I move into the city. My housing, car and household help everything will be ready before I land. So I am sure I would not be facing any landlord denying me housing because I am form india. 

But I am quite worried what would life be if I go out for a coffee or for a dinner in a nice restaurant. There are tons of YouTube videos from indian travelers stating that they’re not allowed to enter and even chased away.

I know many of you will say do not come and will unleash a string of vilification because of where I am from. But if you give it a thought, and if you were at my place, what would you have done? Also what do the locals in this forum recommend. 

Thanks in advance for any constructive criticism and practical feedback.",2025-04-10 16:46:05,VietNam,VietNam,news,News,[],0,4,52,,0.55,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1jw2j39/should_i_move_to_vietnam/,pitsnvulva69

In 1940, the Nam Kỳ Khởi Nghĩa (Southern Uprising) marked a pivotal moment in Vietnam’s struggle against French colonial rule, foreshadowing the nationwide resistance of 1945. The people of southern Vietnam revolted, and for the first time, the red flag with a yellow star flew defiantly at Đình Long Hưng in Châu Thành district, Tiền Giang province.

This flag, designed to symbolize the unity and revolutionary spirit of the Vietnamese people, became an emblem of resistance against colonial oppression. Although the uprising was ultimately suppressed, the image of the red flag with a yellow star flying high left an indelible mark, galvanizing the movement for independence.

Lãnh Bình Cẩn, born Nguyễn Văn Cẩn in Mỹ Lợi village, Kiến Đăng district, was a key figure in southern Vietnam’s resistance against the French from 1861 to 1866. As a skilled military leader, he achieved numerous victories, often alongside other historical figures such as Nguyễn Hữu Huân.

Renowned for his organizational abilities and dedication to the cause, Lãnh Bình Cẩn played a crucial role in keeping the resistance alive, inspiring the local population with his unyielding spirit. After his passing in 1902, his legacy remains a testament to the resilience and patriotism of those who fought to defend their homeland.

Student's path is better (?) if I can enroll in a 6 months to a year course but I'm not sure if that would be allowed.

**Direct English Translation:**  
""Phan Hien Dao (1829–1883), from Vinh Kim Dong village, Dinh Tuong province (now My Tho city), passed his doctorate examination in 1858 under the reign of Emperor Tu Duc. He was a talented person, especially skilled in music.""

Phan Hien Dao (1829–1883) was an important historical figure in the Nguyen dynasty, known for his talents and extensive knowledge. He was born in Vinh Kim Dong village, Dinh Tuong province (now My Tho city). In 1858, during the reign of Emperor Tu Duc, he earned the title of Doctor, affirming his position in the country's academic and intellectual circles.

Phan Hien Dao was not only skilled in literature but also a talented musician. His works contributed to Vietnam’s cultural heritage during a time of great social and political change. Although the country faced challenges under French colonial pressure, his artistic and academic achievements reflect the resilience and creativity of Vietnamese intellectuals of that era.

Phan Hien Dao’s life and career left a lasting legacy in Vietnamese history. His cultural contributions continue to be remembered as a testament to the vibrant intellectual and artistic traditions of the Nguyen dynasty.

1k2v7r3,reddit,Lost Passport in International Mail – Any Advice or Similar Experiences?,"Hi everyone,

I'm hoping someone here might have experienced something similar or can offer some guidance.

About a month ago, I had a newly issued European passport shipped to me while I was traveling in Vietnam. The passport was sent from Portugal with a tracking number. On the last tracking update, the letter passed through the UK on its way to Vietnam—but since then, there have been no further updates. Vietnam Post doesn't have the tracking number in their system.



So far, I've taken the following steps:

Contacted UK Border Force, in case the letter was intercepted at a postal import hub there.

Contacted Vietnam Customs, asking whether the item may be held or delayed on their end.

Contacted Portuguese Customs, in case the passport was never properly dispatched or got held up before leaving the country.


Filed an official complaint with CTT (Portugal's postal service) using the Livro Vermelho (their official complaint system).


The passport contains no visa or sensitive insert—just a standard new document—but I’m now in limbo with no clear idea where it is or who might have it. I’ve provided all relevant details, including the passport number, to the authorities mentioned above, and I'm currently waiting to hear back.

Has anyone else experienced a similar situation with an international passport shipment getting lost or stuck in transit between countries? Any tips or ideas on what to do next would be hugely appreciated.

1k2syc2,reddit,Digital Nomad Couple  - coming to VT for 40 days - Last week of May / All June. Where should we base ourselves?,"**Looking for Advice: Nha Trang vs. Da Nang (or maybe near Hoi An?) for Remote Working Couple in Our 40s**

Hey everyone,

I've gone down the Reddit rabbit hole and read pretty much everything I can find about Nha Trang and Da Nang, but I still have a few final questions I'd love some input on from the hive mind! 😊

We’re an Australian couple in our 40s, currently slow-traveling and working remotely (posting this from Sri Lanka!). We’re not on holiday in the traditional sense—we’re still working full-time while trying to build a healthy, sustainable lifestyle as we move around.

We’ll be leaving Sri Lanka soon (visa limits), and I’m looking at Vietnam as our next base—ideally for at least a month or two.

# What we’re looking for:

* A **quiet**, comfortable place to live and work
* A **solid daily routine** with a good gym, healthy food, and a bit of exploring
* Definitely **not into the party scene**—we’re 90% sober, so nightlife isn’t a priority
* Walkable area preferred, with access to cafes, gyms, and decent groceries

# Weather:

According to ChatGPT (and other sources), it sounds like **Nha Trang has better weather** this time of year, while **Da Nang can be hit or miss with rain**. That’s nudging me toward Nha Trang, but I’m open to being convinced otherwise.

# About Nha Trang / Da Nang:

* I keep reading about the ""Russian invasion"" in Nha Trang—kind of like the Dubai Marina or Bali vibes? If it’s just a lot of tourists and a few tired buildings, we can manage that.
* We’re *not* looking for beachfront luxury—just a **quality apartment in a quiet area**, near food and gyms.
* Any thoughts on avoiding buildings like Gold Coast or Panorama in Nha Trang? I’ve seen complaints about overcrowding, elevators, and disrepair—reminds me of some high-rise issues in Dubai.

# Also considering: somewhere just outside Hoi An?

Is this a viable option for remote work and daily gym access, or would it be too quiet / inconvenient?

**So my main question: Based on all this, where would you base yourself—Nha Trang, Da Nang, or near Hoi An? And which specific neighborhoods or buildings would you recommend for a quiet, health-focused lifestyle?**

I am trying decide what to do for stay June 28-July 1st. Deciding between booking two basic rooms at either Capella or Sofitel Opera Wing with FHR benefits. The Sofitel is cheaper, however, I am betting on hopefully getting upgraded to a basic Heritage room which on the website appears to be one category higher than the basic opera wing room.

The Capella is approximately 60 USD more per night. Worth it? Or Sofitel? Not sure what to do. Any advice would help.

Other stays prior to arriving in Hanoi are:

\- Park Hyatt Saigon

\- Six Senses Ninh Van bay

\- Amanoi

\- Intercontinental Danang Sun Peninsula

\- Anantara Hoi An vs Four Seasons Nam Hai

\- Deciding on staying overnight in the middle of our stay in Hanoi to stay at Tam Coc Garden (June 29-30 whilst Hanoi stay is 6/28-7/1) to visit Ninh Binh rather than an exhausting day trip \*this is why Stay 3 Pay 2 at Capella is a bit more enticing, yet still cheaper than paying the nightly rate at Sofitel.

1k22ma9,reddit,"I Regretted Signing Up, but the Gym Is Keeping My Deposit for 90 Days","
I recently went to California Fitness for what they advertised as a free 30-day trial.

But when I arrived, I didn’t get to try anything. Instead, I was sat down and sold to for the entire session by a staff member. They told me to come back the next day for a “free personal training” session to try things out properly.

On the second day, I went for what I thought was just a trial PT session. The trainer reassured me there would be no sales. But after the session, a staff member sat me down and tried to sell me a 24-month membership installment plan. I refused, clearly said I wasn’t ready — then they brought out another staff member to pressure me again.

After intense pressure, I caved and gave a 6 million VND deposit, thinking I’d just go home and cancel if I felt unsure.

But when I tried to cancel (the same evening), they said I needed to do it in person. When I returned, they told me no refunds, and offered to convert the deposit into 8 PT sessions instead. They also claimed they had already opened a loan for me with Sacombank before 7PM — even though I hadn’t signed anything for that.

Eventually, after more pushing, they said they’d refund my money — but it would take 90 days.

I’ve received zero services, signed nothing with the bank, and now my money is being held hostage for 3 months. I feel tricked.

Is this legal in Vietnam? Has anyone experienced something similar? What can I do to get my money back sooner?",2025-04-18 11:27:11,VietNam,VietNam,news,News,[],0,2,2,,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1k22ma9/i_regretted_signing_up_but_the_gym_is_keeping_my/,Tab_brickyPh

1k1jwfq,reddit,Poland vs Russia on Facebook: Who’s rewriting WWII history?,"

I came across a Facebook post where the Polish Embassy and Russian Embassy are going at it over WWII history. 

Link here if you’re curious:https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1Chzgz4obU/?mibextid=wwXIfr


(*) Poland claims the USSR helped Nazi Germany secretly rebuild its military after WWI—citing joint training centers for tanks and aircraft in Soviet cities like Kazan and Lipetsk, all starting with the 1922 Treaty of Rapallo. They say Russia now uses ""fighting Nazism"" to justify the war in Ukraine.


(*) Russia fired back, saying those programs ended in 1933, and that Poland actually signed a pact with Hitler in 1934—implying Poland was no less cooperative with Nazi Germany.


I’m no history expert, but a few things stood out:

- Poland’s post feels like they could do better in listing the facts and examples. From the museums and research I've read, there are more solid facts for them to prove their points. The one from this post seems a little bit weak.


- Most Vietnamese commenters sided with Russia and called Poland the traitor.


- A lot of arguments of Vietnamese people in comment section came from school textbooks, which feels a bit one-sided. History, especially war history, needs more than just one narrative.
-> That's is the reason for this question.


- I’ve talked to some European friends into history, and they said Russia’s been playing the aggressor card in the region for a long time—even pre-WWII.

-> It suggests that Russia has never been a reliable ally, and that’s why neighboring countries have always felt the need to band together—like joining NATO today—to protect themselves from its influence

=> So here’s my question to people who study history or just know their stuff:
- What’s your take on Russia and Poland’s roles before WWII?
- How were you taught this part of history—especially if you grew up in Vietnam or outside the West?

Genuinely curious how the narrative shifts depending on where you’re from. Again, I am not a history savvy, enlighten me with your knowledge.",2025-04-17 18:24:06,VietNam,VietNam,news,News,[],0,2,37,,0.55,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1k1jwfq/poland_vs_russia_on_facebook_whos_rewriting_wwii/,Significant-Pick4526

I would hesitate to do it before I leave, as I may end up not getting a job before the 6 months validity is expired. This could be my own doing as I want to continue the travelling, or maybe I just flunk some interviews. And then the other two is a matter of cost I imagine.

I will be spending a few weeks in Hanoi soon, and I am looking to decide on a few weekends or days away since I would otherwise be spending quite a long time in just the city.

I want to go to places that are quiet, slower-paced and a bit more rural/in nature, with the possibility of doing some hikes. I want to avoid places that are overly touristy - nothing wrong with that, since I'm a tourist myself but I've been finding that big crowds and pushy sellers take away a lot of the enjoyment for me.

So far, I think I want to go to Ninh Binh, Sa Pa, Cat Ba + Lan Ha Bay. I know that I almost certainly don't want to do the Ha Giang loop.

I'd really appreciate any other suggestions of what people have enjoyed, or things I should consider with the places I'm already planning to visit.

1jsijzr,reddit,HCMC Apartment Hunt: District 9 vs. Thu Duc for Our Young Family - Need Your Wisdom!,"Hi everyone,

My wife (Vietnamese), our 7-month-old son, and I (English) are looking to buy an apartment in Ho Chi Minh City with a budget of around 4 Billion VND. We've narrowed down our search to a few areas and would really appreciate some advice from those familiar with them.

We've looked at apartments in The Origami and Beverley Solari in District 9 (Grand Park), as well as Opal Garden and Opal Riverside in Thu Duc.

One of the main attractions of District 9 for us is the potential for more space and slightly cleaner air, which we think would be great for our young son as he grows up. However, the distance from the city center is a definite consideration.

In Thu Duc, we liked some of the Opal developments. A significant point is that the apartments in Opal Garden come with a ""pink book"" (sổ hồng), which as a foreigner, gives me a greater sense of security alongside the sales contract. However, we found that Opal Riverside does not currently have pink books.

We're trying to weigh the benefits of more space and potentially better air quality in District 9 against the closer proximity to the city center and the peace of mind of having a pink book in Thu Duc (Opal Garden).
Our main questions are:

 * For families with young children, which district (District 9 or Thu Duc) do you think would be more suitable and why?

 * Does anyone have experience with the Vinhomes Grand Park (The Origami/Beverley Solari) or the Opal developments (Garden/Riverside)? What are your thoughts on these projects and the surrounding areas?

 * Specifically regarding the ""pink book"" situation with Opal Riverside, does anyone have insights into why some new developments might not have them immediately and what the potential risks or timelines could be? Is it something we should be significantly concerned about?

 * Considering our budget of 4 Billion VND, are there any other areas or specific apartment complexes we should be considering that might offer a good balance of space, convenience, and legal security (like having a pink book)?

Any advice or personal experiences you can share would be hugely appreciated as we make this important decision for our family.

##**Tips to quickly find answers for your questions:**

Many of your questions may have been answered since people keep asking the same ones again and again. Here is a quick tip to find the answers for yours.

First, [have a look at our old sticky threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ASticky). A lot of useful information there. A lot of questions have been answered.

You can also use the search feature of Reddit, just like you do with Google.

Another option is to use Google, as Google understands your queries better than Reddit and can return better results.

Go to Google. Add 'site:https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/' next to your queries (without quotes). For example, if I want to find info on eVisa in this subreddit, my query to put in Google is 'eVisa site:https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/'.

1jog3uc,reddit,"Northern Vietnam - Sapa vs Ha Giang, Mai Chau vs Cat Ba","Hi all,

I'm travelling around Vietnam for 1 month in April/May and could really use advice. I'll be flying to Hanoi with my boyfriend and travelling Northern Vietnam with him for 2 weeks, before he flies home from Hanoi Airport. Then I'll be joined by a friend in Hanoi. My friend and I plan to do the 3 day Lan Ha Bay cruise together, before heading to central Vietnam for a week, then flying out of Ho Chi Minh Airport. I'm struggling to decide how to fill the 2 weeks with my boyfriend.

The provisional plan I've drafted is:

* Day 1-3: Hanoi
* Day 3-8: Ha Giang Loop (and travel to Ha Giang)
* Day 8-11: Ninh Binh
* Day 11-14: Mai Chau/Pu Luong OR Cat Ba Island

I'm hesitant to spend more time on Cat Ba Island because I'll be doing the 3 day Lan Ha Bay cruise later that week. However I haven't seen much on Mai Chau/Pu Luong online so I'm not 100% committed to it.  
  
I'm also interested in Sapa and the Phong Nha caves but both seem like they'd involve a lot of additional travel. I think we'd like to keep to 1 major bus journey (6 hour+) as our flight over will be very long.

Lastly - does anyone have any recommendations for decent Vietnam travel guides? Generally everything I've seen so far has been from people who did the classic '2 weeks North to South Vietnam' trip, which doesn't really suit my slightly slower, more Northern focused trip.",2025-03-31 22:27:35,VietNam,VietNam,news,News,[],0,2,2,,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1jog3uc/northern_vietnam_sapa_vs_ha_giang_mai_chau_vs_cat/,arthur-russell

Logic would probably put the person in what is modern day District 3 of Ho Chi Minh City, as this is where Saigon's India Town was located. 

Is their any archive that I could research to better understand the genealogy of something like this?  I have a person's name, when the left Pondicherry, and perhaps when they landed in a coastal are near Saigon... guessing they landed at Cap St Jacques in L'Indochine...modern day Vung Tau, Vietnam.

1jmr4sc,reddit,"I'm looking for advice for travelling from Da Lat to Hoi An! Looking at bikes and buses, any advice appreciated. More info below.","My husband and I have lived here and worked in the same school for 6 years now. We have some holiday time during the summer, and I'm considering doing some further studying to be able to work at international schools. So I wanted to check out the area we would most like to live in (least pollution, central coastal region). We live in Hoa Binh city now, which is great, but we are getting air pollution from Ha Noi. 

I've visited Hoi An before (not the super touristy bits, mostly An Bang homestays etc). We love the slower pace there compared to the pretty intense Ha Noi outskirts. 

But, to the point: is it pleasant to drive from Da Lat to Nha Trang for a short holiday?  And from there on, upwards to Hoi An? I'd obviously want to break the drive up to five times, but don't have unlimited time off. So I've been wondering which the best parts are to bike, and which would be better off bussing? 

Thinking of flying in to Da Lat, 2 nights, and then a night per stop, hopefully still allowing for 3 nights at our amazing Hoi An An Bang homestay place.

1jmfofp,reddit,Question about where to find burial of French soldier in Can Tho?,"Hello, I am not sure if this is the right subreddit to ask this but it seems there isn't really any other major Vietnam  related subreddit that I could find with someone that might help. Let alone one having to do with the Indochina War. 

So one of my relatives (Raymond Traumann) was a French soldier in the French Army in the 6e RIC of the 9e DIC. Him and his unit landed in Cochinchine in December 1945 to fight against the rebels (as they called) them and take back Indochina. In January 1946 he was killed in an ambush (it seems in the general Can Tho area) along with an adjutant next to him Luttenhaner, and they were brought back to Can Tho where he was buried in a cemetery next to his comrades where they had a funeral service. This information comes from a [letter typed up](https://wwii-archives.org/index.php/File:144_-_Lettre_du_Commandant_du_Crest_en_Indochine_de_l%27arm%C3%A9e_fran%C3%A7aise_concernant_la_morte_de_Raymond_Traumann_le_23_Janvier_1946.pdf) by his commanding officer commandant du Crest. 

As far as I am aware Raymond's body was never sent back to France and stayed buried in Vietnam. Unfortunately doing while some research I can't find any info about French military personnel buried in Can Tho (maybe the Military Cemetery in Can Tho but it seems that is mainly VC). 

So I was curious if anyone had any information about whether he could still be buried there, moved to somewhere else, or be pointed to somewhere/someone who would know.

1k5c8am,reddit,[Travel Advice] Vietnam Trip Late April–May – Where to Be for the Holidays (April 30 & May 1)?,"Hi everyone!

I’m traveling to Vietnam from the end of April until May 13th, and I’m looking for some itinerary advice.

So far, I’ve booked a hotel in Ho Chi Minh City for the first 3 nights, then I’ll be flying to Da Nang on April 28th. From there, I haven’t planned anything yet—open to suggestions!

I’m especially curious about where to be for the April 30th (Reunification Day) and May 1st (Labour Day) holidays. I know these are big national holidays, and I’d love to be somewhere with either unique local celebrations or just a good vibe—whether that’s fireworks, festivals, or even somewhere more chill to avoid the big crowds.

Would it make sense to stay around Da Nang/Hoi An for the holidays, or should I try to be somewhere else (Hue? Hanoi? Somewhere more off-the-beaten-path)? After that, I’ll have around 2 weeks to explore more of the country—north or south, I’m open!

For context, I’m into nature, culture, food, a bit of history, and scenic spots. Not really into clubbing or party scenes, but open to cool local events or experiences.

Any recommendations or travel tips would be really appreciated!

Hoi An is a bit of a tourist trap and I do have the option of heading to Hanoi or HCMC if necessary for this.

1k0eia9,reddit,Group Dining Recommendations in HCMC,"Hi everyone! I’ll be in HCMC in a few weeks for an event and at one point we want to hold a dinner with 10-12 friends.

This group aside from 1-2 people are all foreigners, and love Vietnamese cuisine. I’ve been trying to find recommendations online for restaurants suitable for group dining (bonus points if it has a view) but can only find mostly fine dining or international cuisines. Given that it’s all visiting travelers I think the group would best appreciate a restaurant focusing on local foods, but maybe we should stick to that while we explore the city and this dinner could focus on something else that comes highly recommended. This group is also fairly casual, so we’d be fine with a wide variety of environments from casual vibes up to high end and dressy.

Maybe I’m being too picky, so if you have any suggestions that you would take a group of foreign friends for dinner please drop them in this post regardless of any of the requirements I’ve set! I trust local opinions more than anything from a bunch of travel blogs. Especially interested in any quirks, like specialties in their menu, a view, etc. If there’s something unique maybe we’ll try to go there anyways even if it doesn’t fit this dinner!

* Hoi An – “too touristy” ""beaches are gross""
* Phú Quốc – “feels fake/commercial”
* Con Dao – “not the real Vietnam”
* Da Nang – “just a big city with a beach” ...so I’m a bit stuck.

What I *am* looking for is something with the same vibe as Ko Lanta in Thailand — laid-back, scenic, scooterable, not too built up but still with some options. Could be coast or countryside, or even a combo.

It's one of the more iconic landmarks in Hanoi so it feels like a wasted trip if I don't go. But then again I'm afraid I might not enjoy myself there

Should I still go ahead and at least experience it once? If so what would the best way to go about doing it. I was thinking booking online (any recommendations?) or going there to book by asking my hotel if there are any recommendations. 

I read that the roads are really dangerous? I feel like I will be fine jaywalking and crossing so long I keep a steady pace and wave my hand or something but I'm still afraid that if anything does happen I'll be at a loss on what to do. 

Grab is the way to go right? From the airport to my accommodation? Or should I check with my hotel if there is a pick up service?

Im going to Vietnam from the 30th April to 16th May. Staying in HCMC for a couple nights before flying to Hanoi where I’ll be staying from the 2nd-10th May. 

My plan was to stay in Hanoi for the first 2 nights, 4-6 in Ninh Binh which leaves me 6-9th unbooked. I originally wanted to do 2N 3D in HLB but have heard mixed reviews, I.e trash in the water, polluted waters, overcrowding, etc and the cruise I was going to book is Elite of the Seas. I assume most cruises have the same itinerary, but idm paying the extra £££ for a luxury one.

I have heard Cuc Phuong is a great place to visit too and that Ninh Binh is pretty much the in-land version of HLB, so don’t want to “waste” time if HLB is not worth the visit.

Any suggestions based on your experiences?

1jx5y9m,reddit,What would you like to see represented in fictional Vietnamese characters/stories?,"Hello! I am an artist from Canada, and I really like having a large, diverse cast of characters.

I have Hoàng Bảo (left) and Võ Xuân (right). While Vo is a decently common last name, I named him after Võ Quý since Xuân has a bird sanctuary and studies zoology and ornithology!

He has a pet crow called Tien (meaning immortal), would this be an odd name to give to a bird?

Bao is very basic lol. He's a classic salaryman.

Firstly, do these characters ""look"" Vietnamese? Would you be happy seeing them in a series or comic? If not, what should I change?

Secondly, (this brings me back to the title of the post) what would you want to see represented through Viet characters? They're still in the very early stages of development so I'm open to everything! Favourite foods, passtimes, family life, etc etc etc

UPDATE: Went to a clinic I mentioned above which is near the hospital. They got me in pretty quick and the dr said I have inflammation in my ankle and a possible infection. They prescribed me 4 medications to help with the inflammation, infection, and pain. He did speak some English, but I was very happy to have my partner to help translate everything and help fill out paperwork. The Dr visit cost $5 USD and all of the prescriptions cost $26 USD.

The Godfather Part 2 is called a lot of things: The best sequel ever made, one of the best movies of the 70's, The Great American Movie. But a tearjerker? From the outset it doesn't really look it.

\-----------

There's plenty of films that scarred me, etc. I picked out Friday the 13th Part 2 for a sleep over at like 10 years old. No bueno. Here's a bunch of cover art from VHS store horror movies I compiled, FWIW: [https://imgur.com/gallery/vhs-horror-movie-cover-art-that-enthralled-captivated-you-youth-from-late-70s-to-early-90s-9L046CH](https://imgur.com/gallery/vhs-horror-movie-cover-art-that-enthralled-captivated-you-youth-from-late-70s-to-early-90s-9L046CH)

But I'm not talking about horror, vs just not ""getting it"" or having adult themes way out of your league?

The one film I saw because ""cute robots"" was **Silent Running by Douglas Trumbull**, starring Bruce Dern. Almost feels like a spiritual ancestor of High Life in one sense, but like things that made you who you are... Fred Rogers, Carl Sagan, etc... this film gave me a presence of mind about nature that I learned way too young. It's at the core of how I behave and treat this planet... 

But it shattered and broke me. I know Huey's forest is still out there, but when Louie died, and when Dern says goodbye to the robots... I mean, it was just pure trauma for my child mind.

It is an experience I will carry with me forever.
By the end of the movie I felt empty, confused, and kind of let down as many others Im sure have felt. But as my day went on and I reflected over what I had watched, that feeling started to grow. And gets only stronger whenever I think back to the movie, the themes and its plot. This is the only experience I’ve ever had like this and I’m curious if anyone else has something similar with this film or another.

Here are a few I’ve seen recently:

Incantation – Loved the atmosphere and presentation, especially how it played with curses and audience interaction. It was really well done… but honestly, not that scary.

Longlegs – Cinematography and storytelling were top-notch, and I was hooked the whole time. But that ending... when it boiled down to *""the devil made me do it""*, it just killed it for me. I’m not into supernatural explanations that feel like a cop-out.

Gonjiam: Haunted Asylum – This one was solid, especially for found footage. Great pacing, great use of the setting. I want more like this. (But it wasn't scary at all)

**NGL**, for me, the top two that have had this lasting effect are hands down  **The Truman Show** and **Westworld (the series)**.

They seriously messed with my head back when I watched them, and even now, years down the line, I still get this lingering, creepy feeling sometimes. It planted this seed of doubt... like, **what if I'm just an NPC?** What if most of us regular folks are just background characters in some massive simulation or game?

It's made me look at the world differently ever since. Maybe those super-rich people or powerful politicians constantly **on the feed** aren't just regular people, but the actual players? The ones with **P2W (Pay-to-Win)** advantages, or maybe even avatars controlled by the **devs/admins** running the whole show, walking among us **IRL**?

It's a properly chilling thought that these movies planted in my brain all that time ago, and it genuinely still gives me goosebumps just thinking about it.

Anyone else have a movie do this to them? Left you with a deep unease or a creepy thought that revisits you long after you watched it? Which ones were they?

Not The NeverEnding Story.

Gmork's explanation, for one.

The performances are superb. Noah Hathaway is extraordinary, he carries most of the film, conveying his acting with great committment. Barrett Oliver is believable as a boy dealing with loss and bullying and fully wrapped in the book. Tami Stronach's Child Empress is a brief but memorable presence. Everybody does a good job.

I. Love. This. Film.

I grew up in a ""movie family,"" with my dad quoting both famous and obscure films left and right throughout my childhood. He quoted this one *a lot* (specifically, ""I didn't know you were the Sundance Kid when I said you were cheating""). Those quotes often led to the realization that his delivery sometimes was considerably better than the reality of whatever movie he was quoting, LOL

This, this right here, is the #1 exception. 

When I finally sat down and watched it at 16 or 17 (early aughts), I remember being blown away. This is one of the only movies that has retained that wonder for me over 20+ years now - I turn 40 this year.

I'm not saying there aren't absolutely valid criticisms. There are. But this post is just about appreciating a film where, IMHO, the actors and the script and the cinematography are all nearly perfect.

And the LINES. Just... I could quote this film forever. Which is wild because the script is in itself pretty sparse.

""Who ARE those guys?""
""You just keep thinkin', Butch, that's what you're good at.""
""Rules! In a knife fight?!""

We've built these features based on your feedback:

* Ability to see the solutions to previous games
* Sort actors & movies alphabetically and chronologically
* Hovering over or selecting an image will show the movie title/actor name.
* We also made [TV Circuit](http://wfhgames.com/tv-circuit) after getting a lot of requests for it. I think it tends to be a bit harder than Cinema Circuit.

However it came out when anti-war sentiment was at an all time high and it flopped hard, I have seen figures stating it took no more than £100,000 when it was released at the cinema.

1jkfptq,reddit,'The Assessment' was really good and it's a shame no one is seeing it,"So this just came out last weekend, I had never even heard of it until the week before when I saw a trailer in the theater and thought it looked intriguing, come to find out it made all of $152K this weekend from less than 300 theaters. I'm kind of baffled as to why; this has a really strong visual presentation, three recognizable actors giving very good performances, and a really compelling hook. The only reason I could imagine it not clicking with a bigger audience is because it gets darker than I expected, but I'm shocked that this seemingly just slipped completely under the radar, especially because it seems like the kind of movie this sub will inevitably come across as a 'hidden gem' in the next few years.

There's definitely an obvious comparison to be made to *Ex Machina* just in the fact that they're both seven day sci-fi experiments set in a futuristic location starring Alicia Vikander, but these are very, very different films beneath the surface. There's a LOT more going on in this film than I expected, and one thing I really have to say is that it feels like the kind of premise that in the hands of another filmmaker could've very easily become one-note or repetitive, but I never felt as though this did. I was really surprised how much depth they managed to give to all three main characters, and how many themes they managed to explore in ways that actually felt meaningful.

There's definitely some visual elements and ideas that feel as though they were inspired by other films (namely one room in the house that feels very reminiscent of *Blade Runner 2049*), but there's still something really fresh about this that feels like it's coming from a new voice.

If you have a chance, I'd definitely recommend checking it out.

1jy9fkv,reddit,The Lives of Others (2006) is incredible,"The Lives of Others, or *Das Leben der Anderen*, is a German movie that came out to a lot of critical acclaim in 2006, and eventually won the Best International Film Oscar over Pan's Labyrinth. I finally got around to watching it, and ended up loving it. Highly recommended to anyone looking for an intelligent, mature historical drama with fantastic performances

The summary is as follows: In 1983 East Berlin, dedicated Stasi officer Gerd Wiesler begins spying on a famous playwright and his actress-lover Christa-Maria. Wiesler becomes unexpectedly sympathetic to the couple, and faces conflicting loyalties when his superior takes a liking to Christa-Maria.

While the above makes the movie sound like a spy thriller, it really is more of a character study with social commentary. There are some thriller-esque elements to it, and the movie *can* be pretty tense at times - this isn't really the focus however, as it's more concerned with making a point about the impact of a political and socially repressive regime on its people, whether they're against it or are complicit in supporting it. 

The performances are what really make this such a great experience. Ulrich Mühe as Wiesler is fantastic, especially considering how restrained and low-key the role is. He expresses so much with just his eyes and facial expressions alone. It almost feels like he created this entire person on screen without saying a single word about his personality, because pretty much all of his dialogue is strictly about the work he does. Sebastian Koch and Martina Gedeck are really good in their roles as well.

This is definitely a slow-burn narrative that grows in power and impact as it moves along. Honestly, for the first hour or so, I thought it was just ""good"" - well-acted and directed, but not really exceptional in any way. But halfway through, it hits another gear, the screws are tightened around the characters and it gradually transforms into a tense, anxiety-inducing story before eventually ending up as a bittersweet tragedy. 

I also have to applaud the ending, as it's one of the most cathartic and emotional conclusions to a movie I've seen in a while. The scene in the bookstore, with Wiesler going ""it's for me"" and the camera freezing on his face for a while - just beautifully done.

1jzpi3y,reddit,"Boiling Point (2021) pulls off a 90 minute single take and is probably my favorite movie with this ""gimmick""","Decided to watch this after being super impressed with director Philip Barantini's work on the Netflix show Adolescence. The way he stages and blocks his actors in order to pull off this technical feat is nothing short of brilliant. The movie is incredibly tense, set in a single night in a busy restaurant, and the camerawork massively contributes to this overwhelming sense of dread that lingers over every scene. Stephen Graham and Vinette Robinson are absolutely magnetic as the head chef and sous chef, Robinson especially absolutely kills it during this one scene where she delivers the most realistic frustrated monologue I think I've ever watched (I think she flubs a couple lines but it added to the sense of realism, I often stumble over my words when angry, too). I've seen a few films that try this same gimmick - Birdman is fantastic, Victoria is awesome, 1917 is masterful. But while those movies are technical marvels in their own rights and maybe manage to pull off some flashier camera moves, none of them made me feel as claustrophobic and tense as this one.

1k0wubp,reddit,Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is about breaking the cycle and growing instead of getting into another one,"I often heard the opinion that the last scene of the movie is a subtle hint of how Joel and Clem get into another cycle of erasing themselves. And while I understand the logic of why people read it like this, I still feel that something is off with that interpretation.

If you didn’t know, in the [original](https://collider.com/eternal-sunshine-of-the-spotless-mind-original-ending/#:~:text=Eternal%20Sunshine%20of%20the%20Spotless%20Mind%27s%20original%20script%20had%20a,from%20a%20more%20cynical%20perspective) script the ending is a scene 50+ years after where Clem erases Joel for the 15th time while Joel leaves her audio messages asking why she's ignoring him, and Mary is assisting Clem.

It’s just that initially in the director’s mind, the movie was supposed to be a little more realistic and gritty. If we look at a few deleted scenes, we learn and see more of Naomi’s character, previous Joel’s girlfriend whom he mentions at the beginning of the movie. I think they’ve cut the crucial [scene](https://youtu.be/ovxHfv8CR0s?si=e_yjpfzwmLCo1peq) of Joel and Naomi’s breakup, where Naomi highlights to Joel that ""the thing is, whatever you think it is you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off - you're still Joel with the same problems"". I think this scene is crucial to understanding the difference between Joel's character before and after the erasure process.

When we see Lacuna Inc. for the first time, it seems like a fully legitimate business that's been functioning successfully for some time already, and there's not much to go wrong with the procedure. But the thing is, they are failing big time with Joel, Clem, and Mary, all at the same time.

With Clem, it goes wrong when creepy Patrick tries to stage ""love"" by using the things Joel was doing and saying before the erasure, and it seemingly rubs Clem off. With Joel, it goes wrong when he literally tries to stop the erasure process and tries to hide Clem in his deepest traumatic memories, and they erase Clem with the memories that weren't supposed to be erased at all.

And especially wrong it goes with Mary, who at first is the most enthusiastic of all about erasing memories. Suddenly she gets the real disgusting taste of it when she learns that she erased memories of her previous affair with Dr. Mierzwiak. And even more, in the [alternative](https://youtu.be/rb5R2MsQkxI?si=GQ6DzF-zYQpe4wPw) deleted scene Mary was supposed to learn that Mierzwiak got her pregnant and also convinced her to have an abortion before erasing her memory. Imagine what a shock this is for a character, to learn that you had an abortion, and don't even remember that.

But still, it's Joel at the center of the story, the main accent of the story is on Joel, how he behaves, and how he interprets things.

People love to point out that after the erasure process, Joel goes to Montauk again, and repeats the same steps... But he is not. This is a different Joel after the erasure.

If you really compare Joel before and after the erasure, you'll notice the real difference. Let's break it chronologically:

\- Joel meets Clem in Montauk, and they spend some time together. But then when Clem suggests spending more time together and going crazy, Joel freaks out and runs off. He later regrets running off, as he explains it while he's in his mind.

>I don't know. I felt like a scared little kid. I was like... It was above my head. I don't know. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation, I think. You said ""So go"" with such disdain, you know?

It's the very first case when Joel's insecurity cause issues and friction in his relationship with Clem.

\- Joel approaches Clem in the library trying to ask her out to go somewhere. Clem gives him her famous ""I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours"". In his mind, Joel confesses that even after that speech he still thought that Clem would save his life.

\- Then Joel breaks up with Naomi to be together with Clem.

\- We don't know if Joel had any other relationships before Naomi, but Naomi's phrase about Joel dragging his problems in every relationship assumes that if there were other relationships, Joel kind of was already in his own loop of constantly ruining relationships with his insecurities.

\- Joel and Clem get together, and as Naomi predicts, after the thrill wears off, Joel ruins it with his own jealousy and insecurities. It makes Clem go and erase him.

\- In an impulsive act, Joel goes to erase Clem too, but then he sabotages it, and he erases core child trauma memories that were causing his insecurities when he was with Clem.

\- After the erasure, by some miracle, Joel goes to Montauk and has his ""second"" first meeting with Clem there. But while Joel is depressed by having blank 2 years of his life (erased), you can notice that he's not that insecure anymore. After the conversation with Clem on the train, it's Joel who offers her a ride. It's wild to compare this Joel to the one who ran off from Clem in the beginning, you know? This New Joel even spends some time at Clem's home, and then when he comes home, he's waiting for a phone call from Clem with excitement.

\- Literally second meeting/date with Clem, they go to lie on the ice lake. While Joel is a bit unsure about this idea, he doesn't run off, and he goes along with it. He's *enthusiastic* about it. Again, compare it to the insecure Joel who literally left Clem alone in that house in Montauk.

\-After that in the morning Joel has enough self-security admitting ""I had the best fucking night of my entire fucking life"".

\-Joel loses it for a bit after the truth comes out, but to be honest, who wouldn't lose it like that in such a situation?

And the final scene in the apartment. New Joel listens to all those wild things his older version is saying, and he wants to fall through the ground out of shame. He's so uncomfortable while listening to it. When he says ""I wouldn't think that about you"", it's not just *words*. Now he's literally secure enough not to think such wild and evil things in his head.

It's the scene where you can see this huge gap, this huge difference between the Old Joel and the New Joel. The last words we hear from the tape while Clem is going out is ""I thought I knew her so well. But I don't know her at all. What a loss to spend that much time, only to find out that she's a stranger.""

It's the old Joel who spent so much time with her but didn't really know her in the end. And the new Joel isn't like that at all.

The final scene in the corridor mirrors the library scene they had before, and it's crucial to understand the difference here. Clem repeats her famous ""I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind"". And while Old Joel was still hoping that Clem would ""save"" him even after that speech, the New Joel was just literally exposed to the nastiest shit they had in their relationship. At this point, there's no illusion about ""saving"" anyone. New Joel says ""Okay"" as now he's secure enough to face all the imperfections he'll see down the road.

And getting back to Mary for a bit, think about the contrast. In the original script, she was still working in Laguna Inc many years later. In the movie, she's already been in the cycle of repeating her affair with Dr. Mierzwiak for an indefinite amount of time. But this final time, she learns the truth, and whether it's just an affair, or abortion in the more gritty version of the movie, she decides to break the cycle. She sends everyone's tapes back to them, and the damage it will cause to the company is hard to define. Whether it's just an affair or an abortion, at this point Mary doesn't want to have any business with Mierzwiak or the whole erasure procedure again. She burns the bridges.

And overall it raises an interesting conflict of ideas. While the original script is trying to prove that people don't change, and Clem and Joel would go into a repeating cycle, the movie tries to prove the opposite. The movie tries to prove that while people are messy and imperfect, there's still a chance for a brighter future as long as people are open enough to face the harsh truth.",2025-04-16 22:05:02,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,88,9,,0.85,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1k0wubp/eternal_sunshine_of_the_spotless_mind_is_about/,PIRATEOFBADIM

1jxvqxf,reddit,The Back to the Future Trilogy. The perfect trilogy.,"Today is day two of a three day BTTF rewatch. Yesterday i watched BTTF, i've just finished watching BTTF 2 and tomorrow i'll watch 3.

I have seen all three films multiple times, I have read and watched all sorts of behind the scenes trivia and details about them. I know these films and yet they, especially 2, are flawless. I know what to look for, the subtle clues that all is not as it seems and even knowing what i'm looking at and where I still either don't notice or it's not distracting.

For example i know at some point Marty appears to have three hands, i didn't notice as I was so engrossed in the film I forgot to look.

The dinner scene is still my favourite scene, it is so perfect, you have three copies of Michael J. Fox interacting around the same table and even knowing that and seeing the scene multiple times over pretty much all my life I still find it utterly perfect. As a young child I didn't realise Marlene was also played by Michael J. Fox, i thought they got an actress in. I realised later on though, possibly the third or fourth time I watched it,

There is a scene just as they arrive back in 1985 and the car lands and turns into a driveway, in real life this is a model landing then the lamppost is used to cover up the transition between model and real car yet it is superb, i have watched the scene many times and yet its perfect, it is so smooth. [See it here](https://youtu.be/rhNDsPMaK_A?t=454) I have watched it frame by frame and it's still flawless. 

Then there are the plot threads, there are no loose ends, it just all works, there are elements used from the first film and in 2 there are setups for scenes in 3. Everything is neat, Well apart from the second car in the third film but i'm sure the lack of spare parts for a DeLorean in the 1950s stopped them from cannibalising it for parts, it's mostly just an educated guess though.

I love the first film, I do, the little changes in the 1980s setup in the 1950s are really quite nice and they add much to a rewatch. Like I said though, the second film is the best, utterly amazing, some of the effects are a bit dated but so are the effects in Jason and the Argonauts and I still watch that. I'm not going to criticise any old film for dated effects, it's not like they had access to modern tech.

Anyway if, for some bizarre reason, you have not seen these films go and watch them.",2025-04-13 00:44:20,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,88,43,,0.74,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jxvqxf/the_back_to_the_future_trilogy_the_perfect_trilogy/,Martipar

1k71c2e,reddit,"In Casino, why did Ace trust Ginger when it was clear she shouldn't/couldn't be trusted?","At the beginning of Casino, there's a voiceover of Ace where he says, ""When you love someone, you gotta trust them, there's no other way. You've got to give them the key to everything that's yours. Otherwise, what's the point? And for a while, that's the kind of love I believed I had"". 

How did Ace ever trust Ginger as much as he did? He's a smart guy, and suspicious of everyone. He knew she was a hustler/grifter. And there are moments pretty early on where she blatantly lies to him or cheats him--when she takes money for a drink and doesn't give him change and says she spent it on some tables on the way back; when she calls Lester after their wedding. 

I don't get why he was so blind to her being untrustworthy to the point he gives her the only key to the money that might need to be used to get him out of trouble. (And I'm surprised she didn't take any of it before the end of things.)

Am I missing something--why did Ace think he had the kind of love where he could trust her with everything when she never showed herself to be worthy of that trust in the first place?

It's still a couple years before studio Ghibli was established. Oh this blew my mind on multiple levels.


This was also my first Lupin The Third experience. I...I don't know how I've lived my life so far without having ever experienced the Lupin series. I'm hooked bro. I'm so hooooked. I'm gonna go out of my way and watch a couple more Lupin III movies after this. This was my first introduction to the Lupin cast and I'm already deeply in love with them and feeling nostalgic. Lupin, Jigen, Goemon, Fujiko, Zenigata. Brilliant characters.



This is 70's anime. When animation was still colored flat. And this movie still looks like a masterpiece. The background art is so gorgeous and lovely.


Cagliostro feels so green and lush and cozy. Which is a classic Miyzaki trademark. The aesthetuc choices for the enviorment deisgn is just magnificent.


I understand this is also more Miyazaki and less Lupin The Third as far as characterization and story goes. A bit more lighthearted and whimsical than how classic Lupin is.

1jtuoqr,reddit,How a friendly grandmother's daily walks indirectly gave WALL-E its voice,"In the fall of 2004, I had just moved 2000 miles to northern California to start my new job in the animation industry. Each weekend, I would visit my grandmother who lived in Marin county and spend the day with her. My grandmother was an amazing woman, she was the type who kept detailed notes of all your preferences so she could provide the best experiences for her guests. For example, each time I visited, she had made my favorite sandwich with the exact proportions of condiments and meats I preferred with absolutely no tomatoes anywhere nearby, purchased my favorite soda (she would never keep soda in her own fridge as she did not like it, so she always bough one fresh the day I visited), and have a selection of candies I liked (or at least which she remember I liked from when I was 5). One of our favorite things to do together was walk through her neighborhood and talk with her neighbors. My grandmother lived in her neighborhood for nearly 30 years, and her husband had lived there for 80 years, so between them they knew the history of every house and of her friends inside. She walked her neighborhood every day, and each time she saw someone outside of their house she would stop and talk with them. If she knew someone’s daily schedule she would time her walks so that she would see them outside and conveniently have their favorite cookies with her to give to them. Each weekend, my grandmother and I would walk the one mile loop and she gave me updates on all her neighbors, which numbered at least 30 families. As we passed each house, she’d tell me whose kids just got into college, who changed jobs, the successes of each kid, their favorite foods and movies, etc. She was like a living newsletter, and I loved hearing my grandmother excitedly tell each story. 


One day during our walk, she was giving me the latest scoop on her neighbor Ben, a kind man with a wonderful wife and lovely young daughter, who creates sounds for movies. As we approached Ben’s house, a car pulled into his driveway directly in front of us and a man in his 50s stepped out. “Oh, hey, that’s Ben,” she said, waving to him as he walked to open his passenger-side door. He turned to us, smiled, said “hi”, and as he opened his passenger-side door, out tumbled his laptop, crashing onto the concrete with the screen still open. He shouted a boomer-sanitized expletive and I instinctively rushed over to help him pick it up. As I did, I glanced at the screen.

What I saw stopped me in my tracks: two figures were battling with glowing swords over a river of lava. I immediately recognized it as the ending duel from *Episode III: Revenge of the Sith*. Now, this was September 2004 and that movie wasn’t due out until May 2005. This was the biggest movie everyone was talking about and counting down to. Fans knew that the end of the movie was supposed to be a climatic duel between Obi-wan and Anakin on the lava planet of Mustafar which leads to the creation of Darth Vader as we know him, but everyone was guessing how it would happen. Any hint of leaks were highly valued and reported on sites like Ain’t It Cool News, Dark Horizons, and ComingSoon.net. A modern equivalent would be to unknowingly stumble upon the “On your left” portals scene from Avengers Endgame 8 months before it came out. And here I was, staring at the scene I had been imagining ever since I read about Darth Vader’s origins nearly two decades earlier.


That’s when I realized that “Ben” wasn’t just any neighbor. He was [*Ben Burtt*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Burtt), the legendary sound designer behind the *Star Wars* and *Indiana Jones* franchises. He created the sounds of lightsabers, R2-D2’s beeps, Indy’s whip, Darth Vader’s breathing, and even secretly inserted the “[Wilhelm scream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YDpuA90KEY)” into his movies which led to its modern popularity. He shaped the audio landscape of every major Lucasfilm movie and show for decades. But to my grandmother, who hadn’t watched any of those films, he was just “Ben”, the friendly neighbor with a lovely wife and daughter. 


I gasped, “Holy cow, that’s *Episode III*,” and Ben quickly shut the laptop and tried to do a Jedi mind trick of telling us it was not what we thought it was. I backed off, understanding the sensitivity of what I'd seen and how his literal job was at stake. My grandmother, ever the social butterfly, then introduced us properly, and we got to talking. I mentioned that I just started working in the industry and we shared stories. Ben invited us inside, introduced us to his wife and daughter, and even showed us his [Oscars](https://postimg.cc/yWW7D52w). After a pleasant visit, we thanked him and continued on our neighborhood loop. I was over the moon about the experience, and my grandmother was just happy to have been able to talk to her friends, and to see me happy too. 


At the start of the story I mentioned I had just started working in the animation industry. Well, that was somewhat burying the lede, because the next part is how we get to Wall-E:


At that time, I was working at Pixar Animation Studios on the movie which would eventually become *Ratatouille*. But that movie was still years away, instead, Pixar’s next movie, *The Incredibles*, was about to release in a couple weeks. Soon after my interaction with Ben, Pixar held the “[Cast and Crew](https://postimg.cc/f3BhLjCz)” screening of *The Incredibles* where all the people who worked on the film [came together](https://postimg.cc/gX7Fyz11) and watched the final product. Along with all the artists and developers, the voice cast was there, as were [Steve Jobs, Ed Catmull, John Lasseter, and Brad Bird](https://postimg.cc/pmMv1dyH). The movie played to thunderous applause, and people cheered when [ahem] *incredibly* difficult technical scenes were shown, such as when Mr. Incredible arrives on the island via an underwater path and all the water drains from the hangar.

At the end of the crew screening, John Lasseter announced that “Friends and Family screenings would begin in two weeks”. These were preview screenings shown at the Pixar building where the crew could invite anyone to see the movie weeks before it came out. I remembered Ben’s daughter was really excited about The Incredibles, so on my next walk with my grandmother we went to his house where I invited his family to join the “Friends and Family” screening.


The day of the friends screening [arrived](https://postimg.cc/DmDnL6Tm) and I met Ben and his family at the [Emeryville studio](https://postimg.cc/K17bXygg). Before the movie started I gave them a tour of all the areas which guests were allowed to visit and showed them all [*The Incredibles* art](https://postimg.cc/SXyhktW1) and decor adorning the walls (Pixar always redecorates its buildings with art and [full-size statues](https://postimg.cc/1nX1Nn7p) from their next release). When it came time for the movie to start we shuffled into the theater, performed the “oohs” and “aahs” as the pre-show shooting stars appeared on the theater ceiling (a Pixar tradition), and then watched the movie. Spoiler alert: Ben’s daughter loved it, as did everyone else. There is just something magical about seeing a movie in the building where it was created and surrounded by the creators. 


After the credits finished rolling (never leave before the credits at these screenings), I walked with Ben to introduce him to a few of my coworkers. One of them was the late, great [Ralph Eggleston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Eggleston), a Pixar veteran who had joined the studio for *Toy Story* and touched everything after. When I had first met Ralph he was also working on the *not-yet-titled-little-chef* film, but soon he moved to a top-secret project which was coming out after that one. With the Pixar-Disney partnership ending after *Cars*, all work on later movies was kept under strict wraps, especially from Disney-affiliated people to avoid a Bug’s Life/Antz fiasco once Pixar broke free from Disney (note: Disney ended up not renewing the partnership with Pixar and instead flat-out bought them, many artists' tears were shed). The only thing I knew about Ralph’s project was it had something to do with space based on the cryptic images on his office door. Ralph and I had bonded earlier on *Ratatouille* as we had both grown up in the deep South in relatively small towns and were shocked that we ended up making major movies in CA, although his resume at that time was far, far more impressive than my single, unreleased movie. 


When I introduced Ralph to Ben, Ralph immediately recognized the name and geeked out over his *Star Wars* credentials. I shouldn’t have been surprised, Pixar, and animation/game studios in general, are full of *Star Wars* fans who know every bit of geeky minutia about the series and recognize obscure names who worked on the films (myself included, hence the origin of this story). As Ralph is geeking out, he tells Ben he is working on a project right up his alley. Ralph then waved someone over from across the room. That someone turned out to be [John Lasseter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lasseter), founding member and chief creative officer at Pixar. 


I don’t know John Lasseter. I had never truly met John Lasseter at that time. Technically he addressed me when he spoke to the audience at the ""Cast and Crew"" screening. And I once walked past him in a nearly empty hallway and he vaguely nodded at me in acknowledgment. Yet suddenly I was in a 4-way discussion with him about a project no one could really talk about due to Disney’s spies being everywhere. *Star Wars* geekiness was shared, comments that “we’ll be in touch” were floated, and soon Ben and I were on our own and I had no idea what had just happened. We met up with Ben’s family, listened to more excitement from his daughter about the movie, and eventually parted ways.


Over the following months Ben and I kept in touch, mostly through my grandmother and our walks. She proudly told all her neighbors that Ben had visited her grandson’s workplace, and that he’d had a wonderful time. A few months later, *Episode III* came out. It was a hit, the final lightsaber battle was incredible, and I made a point to stop by Ben’s house and congratulate him on his amazing work. We finally were able to talk about the fight scene which I “did not see what I thought I saw” months before.


I kept working at Pixar for a while, eventually moving off of *Ratatouille* and Pixar in general just before the Jan Pinkava/Brad Bird transition. I saw Ben less often, but my grandmother kept in touch with him during her walks. I learned through her that he was soon possibly going to work at Pixar and I was curious what he could be working on. The one time I asked he was cagey about it, doing another Jedi mind trick that it wasn’t what I thought it was.

 
Years later, I’m watching a futuristic film set in a post-human world filled with trash, cockroaches, and a single robot. Twenty minutes into the film, the title character, WALL-E, upon meeting the sleek EVE robot, mispronounces her name as “Ev-a” with a technical flare. And once again, Ben Burtt’s hard work was causing me to fall in love with these inanimate objects through their various beeps and other electronic noises. 


Sadly, my grandmother passed away a few years later, around the same time I completely left the animation industry. I fell out of touch with most of my Pixar and ILM contacts from that time. But when I think back on my grandmother I smile knowing about her unexpected contribution to the film industry. Now, I know the film industry is a relatively small, close-knit industry. If someone is making a robot film and they need someone to create voices for those robots then Ben Burtt is the top person on the list. He would have ended up on WALL-E no matter what. But I like to think that in this timeline, my grandmother’s penchant for talking to all her neighbors during her walks indirectly led to WALL-E and EVE getting their voices.

TLDR; OPs grandmother walks her neighborhood every day and is friends with her neighbor ""Ben"". During a shared walk, OP meets Ben and realizes he is Ben Burtt, sound designer for all Star Wars films. OP invites Ben to a Pixar screening of The Incredibles and they meet the people who are making WALL-E. Ben is hired by Pixar for WALL-E years later.",2025-04-07 19:58:25,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,71,6,,0.82,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jtuoqr/how_a_friendly_grandmothers_daily_walks/,chocobomog

Chef is a nice feel-good film about a father and son bonding over summer vacation as they travel across the U.S operating a food truck but it has 1 of the most loaded casts that I've ever seen with half the cast becoming Avengers and Jon Favreau becoming 1 of the big wigs at 1 of if not the most powerful media companies on Earth as well two of the biggest Hispanic actors in the U.S John Leguizamo and Sofia Vergara.

1jzl6c4,reddit,Reign Over Me,"This movie is so slept on. Sandler is raw in a way that’s almost uncomfortable, like you’re watching a real person spiral and heal in real time. It’s not showy grief, but it’s a sorta it’s muffled grief, which hits wayyyy harder IMO. The way he talks about his wife and kids, or more often doesn’t, is quietly devastating. Cheadle as well is phenomenal in this. He is always a perfect grounding force. In that scene in the courtroom where Sandler finally lets it out, feels like a cracked dam during a hurricane. Easily one of Sandler’s most emotionally truthful roles, it feels like he’s in the same headspace as like Uncut Gems but inverted. If that one is manic desperation then Reign Over Me is him suffering from a severe stillness in sorrow.

They show love, they are concerned about their daughter but not in a dramatic way. They ask if something is wrong and if they can help and when their daughter says no they drop the subject but still keep an eye on her. Also they show love to eachother.

Some Reviews:

[AV Club - Jacob Oller](https://www.avclub.com/until-dawn-review) \- D+

>Horror, whether in games or in movies, is about setups and payoffs. *Until Dawn* is a film almost exclusively of setups, with the payoffs either mismatched or permanently deferred. In its indecision around what kind of film it wanted to turn a decision-driven game into, firing its shotgun approach haphazardly into the air, it incoherently spins itself in circles.

[Inverse - Lyvie Scott](https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/until-dawn-review-horror-video-games)

>Throws plot out the window in favor of gore and schlock. \[Using\] a time-loop conceit to replicate the feeling of respawning in a video game, it gives director David F. Sandberg an excuse to blitz through as many teen horror tropes as can fit in two hours.

[Screen Rant](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/1647) \- [Mary Kassel](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/mary-kassel) \- 8/10

>Until Dawn takes the trope of the time loop & raises the stakes, immersing us in a thrilling & dynamic world of characters we can't stop rooting for. The movie is at its best when it's not taking itself too seriously. ***Until Dawn***\*\*'s weakest moments are when the action slows down and the writing attempts to psychoanalyze Clover\*\* and her issues. While it's necessary for her to have a fraught emotional backstory and for there to be hints of development, these transitions are far from seamless. Like all scary movies, *Until Dawn* sprinkles in commentary about the nature of grief and fear. However, it doesn't waste too much time trying to have a message, as it knows that isn't what the story is for.

[Slashfilm](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/1996) \- [Bill Bria](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/bill-bria) \- 8/10

>Although the film is deliberately not a repetition of the video game's plot, it absolutely adapts the game's implicit concept of asking the player whether they could actually survive a horror movie or not. ""Until Dawn"" the movie subtextually asks those questions of its viewers throughout, and with so many various beasties to encounter, the answers will vary for each person alone, never mind for multiple people. The movie's variety is the peanut butter to that idea's chocolate, never allowing the film to feel stuck in one mode even as it establishes its own structure. To borrow a phrase from Bobby, ""Until Dawn"" really does feel like the platonic ideal of a graveyard smash.

>Ella Rubin stands out in a cast that meets the bare minimum, and David F. Sandberg proves yet again that he's a filmmaker with vision, talent, and the creativity to craft visually captivating horror sequences.

>Until Dawn shares a title and some key details with the game that inspired it, though it mostly tries to do its own thing – to mixed results. While Annabelle: Creation director David F. Sandberg is able to find moments of bloody fun and tension – particularly in the way he shoots darkness – the lackluster script he’s working with isn’t doing him or the movie any favors. It isn’t a total disaster, but as it pushed its one-dimensional characters through a cycle of horror cinema’s greatest hits, I wished that the morning could come as quickly as possible.

Because he didn’t try to make things grander than they were, or add a lot of bigger more epic things for dramatic purposes. He stayed completely true to real life even though the case in real life went nowhere. Telling the story through the eyes of Jake Gyllenhaal playing the real life cartoonist was the perfect way to tell the story for the film, because that’s where the letters were being sent, so we slowly learn the case at the same time as everyone else is learning about it reading the sent letters.

Toy Soldiers was in heavy, HEAVY rotation on TNT. It's another one I weirdly cherish not because I loved it, necessarily, but because it was just a constant background sound to certain times in my life.

But a mysterious stranger’s arrival changes the course of this improvised holiday forever.

1k4ufeo,reddit,Just bought a Possessor poster. Brandon Cronenberg is doing his father proud—this might be one of the smartest shockers I’ve seen.,"I think \*Possessor\* (2020) is an absolute beast of a film. Grotesque, potent, and genuinely intelligent — not just another slick horror concept, but a brutal, evocative exploration of identity, corporate ethics, and psychological fragmentation. The idea of possession-as-a-service for assassination, with plausible deniability baked into its very mechanics (“no one would believe it anyway”), is such a strong sci-fi premise. But what really blew me away is how \*\*expertly it’s implemented\*\*.

The creative violence feels like early Rodriguez if he had a Cronenberg soul. Every shock is earned, not just stylized — and that final stretch? Devastating. Cronenberg Jr. Doesn’t just live up to his dad’s legacy — he’s mutating it into something uniquely his own.

I loved it so much I bought a poster. Next on my haul is \*Possession\* (1981), which I’ve heard is equally deranged but in a totally different register.

The practical effects in this movie blew my mind. I mean that genuinely and scinerely. I kept doubting the movie to manage and depict the powers of the Kryptonians at every turn, and I was constantly proven wrong. This movie makes you believe that a man can tear down a building with his hands.


I can praise this movie up and down, the Kryptonian trio are a great addition to this movie over the first one. Zod and Ursa are so captivating. And may I add, Sarah Douglas as Ursa is hot as *fuck*.


God how did they manage to capture so much charm and imagination decades before the comic book movie was even a thing.

The sequel thankfully while.....repeating the first movie in a lot of ways, also does a lot of things very differently, and I'm totally invested in all the different things that take place, keeps things fresh when sequels actually do that. Also......DAMN did the second movie double down on drama and emotional moments!

1joy4oi,reddit,"Calling Out Criterion, Arrow, Shout Factory, and Other Boutique Studios Regarding Subtitles or Lack Thereof on Physical Media","I have an extensive collection of movies that I enjoy, including DVDs, Blu-Rays, and 4Ks. I always check to see if they have subtitles, as there are still some movies out there that are still released without them. Because I'm Deaf, I have to have subtitles on at all times, and I understand that even hearing people are having it on too, as not to miss anything. As more movies are being added to the physical formats, a few glaring issues are starting to arise.


**Special Features**

As most of you will know, a lot of these movies come with special features and commentaries from people who worked on the movies. These are great additions to the movies or shows that would make any fan happy to watch; however, releases from boutique studios, such as Criterion, Arrow, Shout, and many others have chosen not to subtitle any of the large swath of special features. Imagine my disappointment when I buy ""The Lighthouse"" from Arrow, and I am extremely curious about the behind-the-scenes of it, only for none of it to be subtitled. Same for my recent purchases of ""No Country for Old Men"" *(Criterion)*, ""Paris, Texas"" *(Criterion)*, ""Trick r Treat"" *(Arrow)*, ""RoboCop 2"" *(Shout Factory)*, and so many more titles in my library. I haven't checked ""Seven Samurai"" from BFI yet out of fear of disappointment that it too will be lacking subtitles. I am willing to bet that 90% of these boutique studios' releases have not subtitled any of them. I have tried not to let it bother me as I am appreciative of owning my favorite movies, but I can't help but grow increasingly frustrated with the lack of implementation of subtitles on special features, especially if they are used as major selling points on the back of the box or in release announcements. Especially considering it may be baked into the price of the movies.

**Foreign Films**

Criterion's most recent release of ""Godzilla vs Biollante"" is what urged me to finally speak up about this problem. I was excited to finally watch this movie, only for the first few lines of the movie, which were spoken in English, to be translated into Japanese. I was immediately disappointed as a few minutes later into the movie, another conversation is being had, and it is being translated into Japanese rather than English. I turned it off and put it away. I have thought of returning it and getting my money back, but in the end I decided to keep it. I looked around in the hopes of getting in contact with someone at Criterion. There was an email address for a person, so I decided to get in touch with him. Unfortunately, I've had no response. Many foreign film releases have fallen into this trap of not translating any English spoken dialogue, and there were no options to resolve that. Netflix, Criterion, and others have repeatedly done so, leaving me confused about what is happening plot-wise.

**Unnecessary Censorship**

Going back to Criterion, I recently watched ""Ed Wood"" on their streaming service, and my wife noticed something odd with their subtitles. With ""Ed Wood"" the subtitles were completely replacing curse words with more family friendly versions. This is one of the more common problems with many streaming services where they will often replace or censor curse words as if all of us deaf people are extremely sensitive to harsh language. I understand that most of these services or releases may have accidentally added the TV versions of the subtitles, and it can happen.

**Conclusion**

With the ever growing library of physical media and more movies being released through boutique studios becoming a far more major player in this, I understand that they may not have the budget, time, or access to provide subtitles. Sometimes, they just don't think about including such accessibility for them. It has grown increasingly difficult to reach out to these studios and have a direct conversation about what can be done in the future, where I don't feel like I'm wasting my money and dissuade me from future purchases.",2025-04-01 15:16:49,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,48,25,,0.71,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1joy4oi/calling_out_criterion_arrow_shout_factory_and/,A_Zombie1223

1k5ljc8,reddit,We need to talk about kevin,"So…I finally decided to watch We Need to Talk About Kevin. After finishing the movie, I came straight here to see what people had to say about the ending and the film overall. One question that keeps coming up is: Why didn’t Kevin kill his mother?

A lot of people interpret it as Kevin wanting to punish her or provoke a reaction—and while I agree with that interpretation to some extent, I have a different take I’d like to share.

I think Kevin didn’t kill his mother because doing so would’ve given his actions a clear motive. Let me explain.

There’s a scene where his mother asks him why he collects those “crash CDs,” and he replies: “There is no point. That’s the point.” That line really stuck with me. It shows that Kevin is fascinated by meaningless things—things that have no purpose.

Which brings me to my theory: he killed his father, sister, and classmates because there was no reason to. His father was kind to him, his sister was just a child, and the classmates didn’t really do anything to him. There was no personal vendetta. And in Kevin’s twisted worldview at the time, that lack of meaning made it worth doing.

But killing his mother? That would have made sense. That would have had a clear motive:revenge, hatred, resentment. And that’s exactly why he didn’t do it.

At the end of the movie, when she asks him “Why?”, he says, “I used to think I knew. Now I’m not so sure.” To me, that shows he’s grown out of that phase of finding meaning in meaninglessness, and now he’s left with confusion and regret, or at least uncertainty.

1juw2vi,reddit,Withnail and I (1987),"I saw Withnail and I just the other night and have since watched it on repeat as its so British, so funny, charming, poetic and yet a Tragic tale of friendship

i didn't realise immediately that it's set in the 60s

2 struggling actors who spend what little they've got on booze and occasionally drugs in their squalid home get the opportunity to spend the weekend with Withnail's uncle Monty out in the country

And it just gets funnier and occasionally awkward

Richard E Grant is fantastic in his film debut and totally committed to the role (he genuinely looks terribly ill) in almost every scene

Withnail is a coward while ""I"" really struggles with anxiety and outside the acting circle they'r both pretty much hopeless in life

But it's a tragic tale as Withnail isn't the one to get his big break as a leading man in some big production it's ""I"" instead

So Withnail is left reciting poetry to zoo animals in the pouring rain while his friend starts his big adventure in the acting world ...I liked the movie so much but the unexpected ending almost had me filling up with sorrow

I think I have a broad scope of genres with comedy that I like, even horror or thrillers, so long as the main focus is the comedy. (No spoilers please)","Edit: WOW! Thank you for all the suggestions, I've got a whole cantaloupe to view now! XD always open to new suggestions. Thank you everyone! :)

Looking for more comedy movies and TV shows to watch as I'm kind of at a loss to find more. Here is a extensive list of comedy movies I like ranging from horror comedy to slapstick in no particular order. I'll also list at the end what I'm not looking for.

Freaky

Keeping Mum

Going in Style

Some Like it Hot

My Favorite Brunette

Road to Bali

Kung Fu Panda

Groundhog Day

8 Heads in a Duffle Bag

Elf (although that's more of a Christmas movie)

Blackbeards Ghost

Weekend at Bernie's 

The Invention of Lying

The Man Who Knew Too Little

Ready or Not

The Frighteners

Renfield

Galaxy Quest

IT crowd (series)

Supernatural (comedy episodes such as Mystery Spot and Bad Day At Blackrock)

Frasier (such as The High Holidays)

Paul

The Last Supper (1995)

The Brand New Testament

Up in Smoke

The Pink Panther (2006)

Vamps

Walk of Shame

Dharma and Greg

The Simpsons (in general)

Buffy The Vampire Slayer (movie but also the series has some funny episodes)

Death Becomes Her

My Favorite Martian

Plains Trains and Automobiles

Yes man

Ghost town

Even almighty

Tucker and Dale VS Evil

What We Do In The Shadows (TV series, the movie was ok)

Clue

I DONT like comedy's that rely on a lot of shock, nudity or gross out humour such as as Movie 54.

I'm not a fan of comedy movies that have a focus on relationships BUT if there is a big element of humor such as Even Almighty I'm cool with it.

I also like dark comedy but again it has to have a lot of humor such as Groundhog day.

I'm good with comedy movies that have a lot of gore in such as Tucker and Dale vs Evil, Ready or Not and Freaky.

I'm good with slapstick humor such as Pink Panther 2006, Death Becomes Her and Plains Trains and Automobiles.

Please help me find more comedy movies (and no spoilers please!), if you have any questions I'd be happy to answer.

Edit: I also liked
Hot Fuzz but not Shaun of The Dead or Worlds End

Monty Python and The Holy Grail

Stan VS Evil

Red Dwarf

I am fully on board with the idea of a Jason Statham cinematic universe. 

I want a team up of Jason Statham Nutty Professor style playing his characters from what I call “Statham’s Professionals films”. The movies where he plays different professions. 

So we have:

- The Beekeeper 

- A Working Man

- The Transporter

- The Mechanic

And whatever he has lined up next. 

Maybe they’re all gathered together as a teams by Statham’s character from Spy.

1jxq7al,reddit,"After Grave of the Fireflies, I watched When the Wind Blows....and it scared me in a different way","It carries a similar theme, set around the Cold War era. This one focuses on the lives of an elderly British couple trying their best to survive during wartime by strictly following government-issued instructions. They manage to survive the initial bombing, but what follows is even more tragic , as radiation sickness sets in and food becomes scarce, they slowly grow weaker and weaker.

What hit me the most was how they still held on to hope, believing the government would come to help...even in their final moments. That part was heartbreaking.

The animation is quite simple overall, but there are scenes...especially the one where the bomb hits , that were absolutely terrifying and brilliantly done. The destruction of the city, the trains, bridges, and homes...it felt like watching a storm rip through everything. I’m not exaggerating, that whole sequence genuinely scared me. It was intense.

I also liked how the husband remained optimistic through it all. He tried to keep things together, clinging to hope, comforting his wife, and trusting the system till the very end.

To me, this movie is about how ordinary people place blind trust in their government ,doing everything they're told ...while those in power make some decisions that leave civilians to suffer the consequences.

I won’t say it hit me as hard as Grave of the Fireflies, maybe because of the animation style or tone, but the quiet sadness in this movie... it lingers. It really does. Watching an old couple slowly fade away, still praying and holding on to faith ...that broke me all over again.

I absolutely loved the movie, especially the character of FL and Brad Pitt. Both represent the industry way too well, especially the downward spiral. The ending was super well, to me it was super relatable. The desire to be great-to be just be so great that people will remember you even after 100 years. 

  
The ending to me was such- Neille and Manny wanted to be part of something great, something bigger than human life. This was their connection. For Manny, the dream ended because he chose to get away from the screen, or to put it better, found satisfaction off-screen. Manny, on the other hand, found herself in the spotlight. Her character was obsessed with attention. She, too, wanted greatness. When watching the film, Manny realized that while Neille might have died at 32, but was still alive in people's memories, so was Jack (Brad Pitt) He remember his words-maybe felt regret but this filmns throws light on many things- To move on, Cycle of life, and also the price of greatness.",2025-04-07 22:17:34,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,39,24,,0.74,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jtxz8d/just_finished_babylon_and_i_loved_it/,darkexplorer666
1jsz77i,reddit,What are your thoughts on George C. Scott?,"Question, What are your thoughts on George C. Scott?

I've been on a binge of watching George C. Scott movies & show and I must say, George C. Scott really is a great actor. He has such a commanding presence when he is on screen, but he also manages to give such a vulnerable side to what character he plays. To me his best roles are Dr. Strangelove & Patton. Dr. Strangelove, for the sheer fact that he (& Also Slim Pickens) managed to outplay Peter Sellers and Patton, which is just a great performance and I consider it the best role he has ever played. He also deliver great performances in Anatomy Of A Muder, The Hustler, The Bible, The Hospital, Hardcore, The Changeling, A Christmas Carol.

I will say though, while George C. Scott is a great actor, some of the films he is in are probably not so great, which is why I think his film career stalled after the 70s, with films like The Last Run, Rage, The Day Of The Dolphin, Bank Shot, The Savage Is Loose, Island In The Streams, & The Formula being very mid, but saved by Scott. I also read that Scott turned down lead roles in In The Heat Of The Night, McCabe & Mrs. Miller, The Cowboys, The Godfather, Deliverance, Network, The Shootist.

However, what impresses me with Scott is that he managed to juggle both his film career and television career, which was a little frowned upon when trying to make a successful film career.

But all in all, What are your thoughts on George C. Scott?",2025-04-06 17:17:30,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,35,88,,0.74,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jsz77i/what_are_your_thoughts_on_george_c_scott/,FreshmenMan

I liked her as well, even though I did feel her character is barely onscreen for the first hour. I liked Isabella Scorupo's resourceful Natalya. Rosamund Pike was okay as Miranda Frost. I found Halle Berry overrated as Jinx. 

Out of all the Bond Girls, the one who stood out the most for me was Famke Janssen as Xenia Onatopp. I've never seen a female villain be that bad in film and enjoy every moment of it. Her ice cold demeanour, the devilish smile as she kills. You can tell she gets a sick pleasure from breaking her victim's waists. 

The Sauna scene she has with Bond is a mix of violence and sexual tension. Bond is terrified of her but also, he finds himself drawn by her. I loved that.

All that being said, the score of the sharks theme is also spine tingling and eerie, and it could have gone on to have a good sequel if they would have kept the graphics and effects what they were (we won't discuss DBS2 here) Honestly it had its flaws, what movie doesn't, but I'm genuinely curious, Deep Blue Sea, bad movie?

1jlaifd,reddit,I revisited Lara Croft: Tomb Raider(2001) and Cradle of Life(2003).,"Mind you, I have zero nostalgia for these films. Only saw them when they were on TV earlier but I didn't hold them in very high regard maybe because I was younger. I was blown away how good these films are now. Did Hollywood forget how to make fun adventure films? Angelina Jolie is perfect in the role, couldn't ask for a better actress as Lara. She put in the work and it shows in the stunts. The pacing is breakneck which I feel is lacking in movies these days. How good was Daniel Craig in his pre-Bond role!

The sequel is even better and Roger Ebert was a fan of it while most critics disliked it then. It doubles the action, the locations and Angelina kicks even more ass. The look is stylized and it works. Some scenes feel straight from the games.

These films are no Indiana Jones but as modern adventure films, they are a blast!",2025-03-27 18:11:40,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,31,18,,0.73,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jlaifd/i_revisited_lara_croft_tomb_raider2001_and_cradle/,ZookeepergameOdd6209

1jkty5x,reddit,The birds [1963]. I have seen this movie more than I've seen my own father.,"This movie is perfect, to me. 

The movie aged well. I love how the actual plot of the birds is very much happening in the background for half of the movie until it is thrust in the forefront. The movie allows you to get to know Melanie, so you understand and care about her. I know some people say the first half drags, but I love how it is its own fun romantic movie before the tragedy sets in. The plot is scary, and I appreciate the feeling of doom. And I like how all the relationships between all the characters have depth. 

The dinner scene where they are debating if birds can attack is perfect. The way everyone reacts and plays off everyone else is amazing. I love the contrast of the hysterical mother with the overly logical bird expert. 

To be honest I have a huge crush on both leads. Melanie is a strong, wild, and clever woman. Mitch is clever, strong, and a gentleman. Both are insanely attractive. They have serious chemistry and the way they match each other in wit is awesome. It is extremely charming. 

Overall, 10/10. I watch it every time I get sick, and it always feels like a privilege. I have seen this movie 50+ times. ",2025-03-27 02:41:30,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,31,12,,0.77,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jkty5x/the_birds_1963_i_have_seen_this_movie_more_than/,ThrowRA-Hanshotfirst

1k5egiq,reddit,I Saw the TV Glow and We’re all going to the Worlds Fair capture loneliness in a way I’ve never seen before.,"SPOILERS for We’re all going to the Worlds Fair and I saw the TV Glow

I know their movies are not for everyone but I just finished watching We’re all going to the Worlds Fair and I saw the TV Glow and was blown away.

 I grew up having no close friends, being homeschooled for a big chunk of my childhood and having basically no parental supervision so I watched a lot of movies, TV shows and anime and I would become totally engrossed in whatever I was watching at that moment, if I was watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Dragon Ball Z or Inuyasha it was all I talked about, and all I thought about and I would go to sleep thinking about those shows. The characters in the shows actually felt like my friends and the fantasy world became more real than real life. 


When I saw I saw the TV Glow I’ve never connected with a movie on that level before. The main character becomes obsessed with a TV show and he has a very surface level relationship with his only friend where all they have on common is their obsession for that TV Show.  Just like the main character, later in the movie, I’ve also revisited old cartoons and shows that used to mean so much to me and was surprised how much they just looked like crappy kids shows.

One thing I liked about We’re all Going to the World Fair is unlike a lot of movies that portray depression this was just about a normal kid. I really hate the “depressed teenager who is an incredible artist or musician” archetype. I thought it was refreshing to see a movie about a normal sad person.


I can’t speak to the “trans” aspects of the films but I can relate to being isolated and uncomfortable in your own skin.

And while the main character is a very young actor, he stays in character amazingly well and his facial expressions and delivery of his (sparing) lines is a above and beyond what I'd ever normally expect from an actor that age. 

Of course there was massive departure from the ""original"" story, but that didn't bother me at all, it's its own story and adaptation and I felt they pulled it off masterfully. 

The only thing I can assume from reading the prevalence of bad reviews is that people are pissed that it didn't do justice to their nostalgia for the ""original(s)"". 

The few reviewers who mentioned uncanny valley also baffle me.  I'm as adverse as the next guy to poorly animated humans and other creatures who speak, but I felt none of that in Mowgli. The animals with speech were remarkably believable and relatable. 

I searched and read threads on reddit from just after it came out, and most seemed to share the same criticisms as the critics, but I'm curious if that is still the consensus?

Those who loved, and loathed, this wonderful movie, I'm looking forward to hearing your opinions. ",2025-03-26 04:32:45,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,30,13,,0.64,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jk3qie/mowgli_legend_of_the_jungle_2018_i_cant_believe/,jawanda

1k0d8w3,reddit,Bedazzled (2000),"Who here has seen this one? I think it's excellent! Brendan Frazer does an amazing acting job as always, as does Elizabeth Hurley as the Devil, not to mention that she was drop-dead gorgeous! This is a remake of a movie from 1967 with the same title, starring Dudley Moore and Peter Cook, who played the Devil in that one. The original is also quite good, but I'd say not as good as the remake, though they're pretty much the same story, i.e., a pathetic nobody gets offered seven wishes from the Devil in exchange for their soul, but the Devil makes all their wishes go bad, though at the end, everything works out for both innocent characters (no spoilers here!) to the detriment of the Devil, who needs to look for another soul.

One thing I prefer about the remake, besides the Devil being played by a very hot woman, is that I thought it was quite thought-provoking concerning good, evil, and what really matters in life. Although I'm not religious and I don't believe in the Devil, at least not literally, I do believe in good and evil and I think we all face a battle between them, and ultimately we all need to decide which path to take and what really matters in our lives, which is what I think both movies are trying to say, but I think the 2000 remake says it better.",2025-04-16 05:51:26,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,28,30,,0.76,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1k0d8w3/bedazzled_2000/,dcterr

At 19, I watched it because of the A-list cast honestly. After The Life Aquatic, the only other movie by him I’ve seen is Fantastic Mr. Fox which I really liked.

Fast forward 20ish years and I decided to sit down and watch Wes Anderson’s movies starting with Bottle Rocket. It was a good movie as his first. Last night I watched Rushmore and I thought it was really good. The quirkiness of Max and the character dynamics were done very well. I’ll watch The Royal Tenenbaums in the next couple days, and I wonder if I’ll appreciate The Life Aquatic this time around now that I’m older.

1jyifg5,reddit,Waterworld,"This is a crazy movie. It had the most expensive production at roughly $175 mil in 1994 and was a box office flop.
It would ultimately become profitable via tv and  cable distribution and with movie rentals and purchases.

Is it a bad movie? It depends on your perspective. I like it as a guilty pleasure movie. It’s flawed and nearly drowns under Costner’s ego, but it is entertaining.

If you like Mad Max or the Road Warrior type of action movies, you will enjoy this. Waterworld is basically the same thing, but on water.

Motorcycles are replaced with jet skis and boats.

This movie also features Dennis Hopper as the main bad guy and leader of the “Smokers”

Kevin Costner almost died during production via an accident while filming a scene in open water.

But upon watching, I must say I was very impressed by this movie. It was very much a throwback to 90's action flicks. The plot was predictable, the action was over the top, and the one-liners were corny. It just worked so well.

The only thing that makes this movie work is the casting for the lead protagonist and antagonist. Viola Davis, and Anthony Davis are not winning Oscars for this movie, but their character portrayals were top notch. The scene were Viola Davis' character describes her time time in the military was gripping and emotional. I wasn't prepared for that in a shoot 'em up flick. And the scene shared with Viola Davis and Anthony Starr discussing the villain's motivation was incredible. Great chemistry between them. 

Bonus shout out to Ramon Rodriguez. His portrayal of a badass secret service agent was superb. He was the perfect foil for the President. 

Overall this was a good popcorn flick. I recommend it for some 90's style action. The obvious comparisons are Die Hard, and Air Force One, so that's great company to be in.

1jvzqn3,reddit,"What movie that shouldn't make you cry, made you cry?","We've all seen our tear jerker movies; Schindler's List, Sophie's Choice, Requiem For A Dream, etc, or movies with iconic sad moments like Iron Giant or Bambi. 

But what movie made you cry when it wasn't really supposed to? 

For me, this movie was Bill and Ted Face the Music. Seems like the least likely movie in the world to make you cry, right? Well, I watched it with my wife for the first time the other night. For some bizarre reason, we merged our Final Destination marathon with our Bill and Ted marathon; we'd watch a couple Final Destinations, then a Bill and Ted per night over a few nights. The contrast was surreal; Death goes from killing people with Rube Goldberg level complexity in Final Destination, to chilling and playing bass in Bill and Ted. None of those movies were particularly sad in any way, I just laughed as people were splattered in Final Destination and as Bill and Ted rocked out. 

Then Face the Music hit me in the feels in two ways. First, it didn't feel the same without Rufus; George Carlin is one of my favorite comedians, one that my dad introduced me to(after I'd already grown up listening to Carlin narrate Thomas the Tank Engine. I was shocked by his comedy at first to say the least.) It was nice to see the hologram, but it made me miss ol' George that much more. The second was the ending, when Bill and Ted realize it's their daughters that write the song that unites the world (and realty), not them, and they kind of pass the torch to them and offer their support. And I just lost it.

 My dad committed suicide this past December, and it's still a really sore spot for me. He was the one who showed me the first two Bill and Ted movies as a kid, and introduced me to heavy metal and horror movies. When I came out to him as transgender, he embraced me as his 'favorite(and only)' daughter and didn't judge in the slightest, even if it was a little bit of an adjustment. I introduced him to my girlfriend, now my wife,  and he was happy for us and thought we were cute together.  I know I'm carrying on the torch for him in a lot of ways. To see Bill and Ted be so chill with their daughters(who are the very least throwing off queer vibes), and be proud of what they accomplish,  just resonated with me because that is almost the exact kind of chill relationship we had. I was a mess. I'll never get the chance to watch it with him and talk to him about it. 

So, now that I've made myself cry all over again, I'll turn the question on to you. What movies made you cry that probably weren't intended to ?

1ju39lg,reddit,Stand by me(1986),"

So I just watched stand by me and it was an amazing ride. I think my favorite character throughout the entire film had to be Chris. I feel like each character brought their own little charm to the group but Chris really stuck out but in the best way. Seeing him support Gordie and the speech he gave him about his writing and how he believes in him was amazing but it was also sad hearing him talk so badly about his self later on and even a teacher using him as leverage all cause she knew they wouldn’t believe him.

 Thing is I want to say each grew but I’m not sure Vern and teddy did but that’s not knocking them since I enjoyed them but by the end they seemed to have grown slightly but I’m sure that’s do in fact to seeing a dead body. Gordie having to come to terms with his brothers death and even speaking to the dead boy like he was his brother was really heartbreaking. Everybody was always comparing him to his brother and the only people who ever seemed like knew the real him was his friends or the only ones who wanted to see the real him.

I could go on but I feel like I’d have too much to say but each character seems to have their own trauma or struggles they have to get through and by the end it feels like they go from boys to men. It feels like based on the stares and somber attitude they realize this isn’t a joke, someone lost their life and it’s fleeting and should be taken seriously, a childish adventure turned into a road into adult hood. Sorry if I sound like an idiot and reading into what happened wrong but it’s either trauma or growing up and I hope it’s the latter. Even the ending caught me off guard but it feels real to me, how life is fleeting and it can be taken away at any given moment no matter how good your intentions or you as a person may be. 
 
 Also side note and I know their kids so it’s odd to ask but did anybody else get the vibe that Chris or Gordie may have had feelings for each other, some scenes with them just felt oddly close like more than best friends?

Sometimes i see a title of which I know it's a good one but never seen (tonight it will be Blade Runner, 1982) or a movie from my childhood long forgotten. 

When I started buying dvd's I used to google titles, using IMDB to see if the rates were high enough. But I have stopped doing this because picking movies based on their covers and small descriptions is so much more fun and simply closer to myself. There are plenty of movies who have a 3/10 rating which, for me.. are solid 8/10... and vise versa.

Picking movies like this also works differenly without endless scrolling. It forces some commitment: even if the movie is bad. But now by watching so many bad movies, the enjoyment and understanding of good scenes only grew stronger. 

Something started to spark inside me, a will. The will to create my own story: a comic. 

I felt like sharing this because it is so much fun and so much greater than Netflix or such

Betty White as a foul-mouth old farm lady, Oliver Platt as a smarmy yet charmy billionaire, and Brendan Gleeson as the dry-witted sheriff absolutely sparkle as the supporting cast, around the fairly boring Bridget Fonda + Bill Pullman leads.

Could you imagine Tarantino’s script and dialogue in the hands of DDL? Everybody brings their A-game when showing up to a Tarantino set, established actors or not. Day-Lewis is the game.

I once read somewhere that Day-Lewis spent roughly a year preparing for his role in “Lincoln.” The product of course, was mesmerizing. It’s one thing to bring a fictional character to life. It’s quite another thing when somebody can bring back an iconic figure in history back from the dead, so convincingly that it felt as Day-Lewis simply held a seance and channeled the President himself. 

Tarantino needs no argument here. 

Honestly neither does Day-Lewis for that matter. 

I believe the level of craftsmanship of both Tarantino and Day-Lewis coming together would be a force to be reckoned with and a cinematic feat of achievement that would be unparalleled.

I don´t say it is necessarily a bad thing but I think it is much more difficult to make a ww2 movie that will not in the slightest give a hint of the moral shortcomings of the germans (or the japanese).

This is I think the core to what makes Das Boot a unicorn. It balances a really touchy subject so masterfully that no one can blame it for being either too political and pretentious, but it´s not lame and totally avoiding on the other side either. It just feels very real and honest.

1k5rtfd,reddit,Watched Bio-Dome (1996) on Earth Day… and the coincidences were weirdly spot-on,"So I half-jokingly pulled Bio-Dome off the shelf tonight and said, “Let’s watch this, it’s Earth Day,” totally forgetting the movie actually takes place on Earth Day. Already kind of a funny coincidence.

Then during the movie there’s this fake newspaper headline that says “Pope Condemns Bio-Dome.” We laughed at how random and over the top it was.

But then I remembered… the actual Pope just died yesterday. And not just any pope...Pope Francis, who was known for being a major advocate for the environment. He literally wrote an encyclical on climate change. So the Earth Day connection felt extra surreal.

And to make it even weirder, there’s a throwaway line in the movie about red food dye, and sure enough, earlier today there was an actual press conference about banning certain petroleum-based food dyes like Red 3 and Red 40.

It’s obviously just coincidence, but it kind of felt like Bio-Dome accidentally synced up with the real world for Earth Day 2025.

1k0eibh,reddit,"I can’t stop thinking about They Shoot Horses, Don’t They ?","I came across it on youtube and have always been intrigued by it. I was sleepy but I started it just to watch a little of it, and I couldn’t stop. This movie fucked me up. 

The level of desperation and hopelessness in this is powerful as hell. Every actor in the cast is outstanding , but Jane Fonda gives possible a career best performance (and it’s one of her earlier ones), Susannah York is haunting and flawlessly portrays a woman who’s psyche is slowly being destroyed, and Gig Young rightfully won an Oscar for his performance. What happened to him later in his life (murder/suicide) just adds another layer of dread. 

Sydney Pollocks direction is phenomenal.  The editing, the pacing, the palpable hell of the scenario is genuinely unsettling and unsparing. It feels like a waking nightmare. The fact it is based on the real dance marathons during the depression is just so devastating. Humanity at its worst and most frail. 

The ending lands at least five big gut punches and left me so overwhelmed, but I loved every moment of it. This has instantly found its way into my favorite films of all time, but it will probably be a while before another viewing. It’s impossible to forget , though. 

Finally, the greatest punch in the face is how timely and relevant it remains , despite being a film from the 60s, about the great depression a few decades earlier. I kept thinking of all of those Mr. Beast competitions, it’s sickening. 

I’ll leave it at that for now, but definitely check it out if you haven’t. But if you’re in a bad frame of mind maybe wait until you’re in a better mood. It’s an uncommonly harrowing experience, and it doesn’t pull any punches.

1jud61p,reddit,House of Gucci (2021),"House of Gucci isn’t exactly a _good_ movie, nor is it a terrible one, but it’s a pretty good Terrible Movie (capitalization required here). That quality is due almost entirely to Lady Gaga’s performance as Patrizia Reggiani & the strength of the script: “Patrizia is correctly pegged by the Gucci patriarch as a tasteless hobag gold-digger…and is also the only other competent Gucci” is a very strong irony/punchline.

The film as a whole is a solid-enough farce all things considered; the one real problem is that director Ridley Scott seems to be the only person involved not to realize it – and this reflects itself in the poor cast control. Gaga is great & Salma Hayek is game as TV psychic/gal Pina, but Jeremy Irons’ Rodolfo Gucci (the aforementioned patriarch) is the only other person who’s even kinda trying. Adam Driver is uncharacteristically weak as deuteragonist Maurizio Gucci, a mix between sleepwalking and obvious embarrassment at the rest of the film. Al Pacino & Jared Leto are both well into the Self-Parody zone (Leto’s Paolo being literally just Carl from _Aqua Teen Hunger Force_) – Scott tries to frame some of their interactions as dramatic, but these don’t land because of how ridiculous their characters are. The effect is that this isn’t deadpan so much as “cast rebellion against the director” – that clash between Scott’s serious take & the script’s “Patrizia’s the only competent Gucci” means that the ending (>!Maurizio’s assassination at Patrizia’s hand!<) leaves a sort of ashen taste in the mouth. 

Basically: Ridley Scott taking this seriously hamstrings rather than elevates the comedic potential – a director more in on the joke could’ve taken this to the heights of black farce. But as it is, it’s a fairly amusing movie that’s really fun if you’re watching it high.",2025-04-08 13:09:38,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,18,22,,0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jud61p/house_of_gucci_2021/,deeppurple1729

1jqaxbc,reddit,The Boys from Brazil,"Who here has seen this movie? I've watched it about 5 times, and I never get tired of it. I think it's an excellent and thought-provoking film with a big warning regarding some potential dangers of cloning and genetic engineering. When the movie came out in 1978, as far as we know, no living thing had yet been cloned, although the necessary science and technology was nearly in place, as the movie also dramatically shows. In 1996, Dolly the sheep became the first cloned mammal, and supposedly a few years ago, a couple of kids were cloned or at least genetically engineered in China, though this isn't definitely known. In any case, I'd say the technology already exists for human cloning and genetic engineering, so what should we do about it, and how do we avoid a madman like Dr. Mengele, who in The Boys from Brazil was able to clone 94 copies of Adolf Hitler?

Besides the obvious ethical concerns this movie presents, I'd say the story and acting were quite excellent, especially Gregory Peck, who played the horribly evil and frightening Doctor of Death, Dr. Mengele, as well as Lawrence Olivier, who did an excellent job as Lieberman, an old Jewish spy who uncovers Dr. Mengele's evil plot and is able to stop him before he has a chance to create the Fourth Reich!",2025-04-03 06:06:35,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,17,18,,0.79,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jqaxbc/the_boys_from_brazil/,dcterr

1k3f34m,reddit,Jenny Curran’s Version of Forrest Gump,"Jenny Curran’s Version of Forrest Gump

I was born in Greenbow, Alabama, in a house full of ghosts and a man who didn’t know how to love anything but his fists and the bottle. My mother died young, and my sisters left. I stayed. I shouldn’t have. He took everything from me.

When I was a little girl, I’d climb high in the trees and pray to be a bird so I could fly far, far away. That prayer became a curse. I ran. For most of my life, I ran from pain, from people, from myself. I didn’t know who I was without the fear. I still don’t.

Then there was Forrest.

He was the only thing in my life that didn’t hurt. He didn’t ask questions. He didn’t judge. He didn’t even understand what had happened to me. And somehow, that made it easier. He saw something good in me I never saw in myself. But loving Forrest? That felt impossible. I wasn’t built for love. I was built for running.

I tried to escape the world in all the ways broken people do. Music. Protests. Drugs. Empty faces in dark rooms. I thought I was chasing freedom, but I was just spinning in circles, digging a deeper hole. I watched people die. Friends. Lovers. Parts of me. And I kept running.

When I saw Forrest again, he hadn't changed. Still staring at me with those wide eyes like I was made of gold. I slept with him because... I wanted to feel something pure. For a moment, I did. But I left. Because Forrest was clean, and I was dirt. He was a dream, and I was still stuck in a nightmare.

I found out I was pregnant a few months later. And for once, I didn’t run. I kept the baby. Our baby. But I never told Forrest. Not because I didn’t want him involved—but because I didn’t want to ruin him. He deserved peace. He didn’t need my wreckage dragging him under.

Years passed. I got sick. Something the doctors didn’t understand—mysterious, incurable, slow. When I felt the end creeping up on me, I did what I swore I’d never do. I called Forrest. Not because I wanted help. But because our son deserved to know the one good man I ever knew.

Forrest married me. He took care of me. He looked at me like nothing had changed. Like I wasn’t wasting away. Like I hadn’t burned every bridge I’d ever built. He forgave me before I even asked.

And when I died… I think that was the first time I ever felt truly safe.

1k0i2ny,reddit,the longest narrative film.,"last year, i made a post on this sub about logistics, an experimental movie that holds the distinction of being the longest feature film of all time. however, you may be inclined to wonder what the longest movie with an actual plot is. well, that honor goes to the 2019 indian drama amra ekta cinema banabo, which roughly translates to we will make a film.

written and directed by ashraf shishir, the film tells the story of a man living in the 1970s in post liberation war bangladesh. after being overcome with guilt about killing an ant, he meet an aspiring filmmaker who insist that life is just one big movie with god as the director. the filmmaker wants to make a movie and tells the man that he should be the hero of the film if he wants to repent for his sins. cue shenanigans.

the film's runtime is a whopping 21 hours. that's right. this movie about a guy feeling bad that he killed an ant is going to take you a vast majority of the day to watch. the film was shot over the course of 9 years beginning in 2009 and had no less then 4,000 crew members. 

as for the reception, the film currently boasts a 7 out of 10 on IMDB but a 49% on rotten tomatoes. make of that what you will.",2025-04-16 11:28:18,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,15,12,,0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1k0i2ny/the_longest_narrative_film/,herequeerandgreat

1jtbjmj,reddit,65 should have been a lot better,"What could have been the closest we got to a Turok movie but instead was basically The Last of Us with dinosaurs.

Overall though IMO I still thought it was ok, at least a watch once if you're curious about the concept and idea, but damn man, it could have been executed better.

Make it R-rated, make it a group of survivors (Could still have the focus on Mills and Koa) to add in a kill count and have the dinosaurs be more accurate as well as feature herbivores which funnily enough during production that's what they originally intended, seriously why did they drop that? We would've had a three-legged anklyosaurus and instead of what I assume was an oversized rauisuchian, it was going to be a triceratops which would had been better to showcase herbivores aren't always peaceful and can be aggressive, the idea the triceratops would've been like a territorial hippo or wild boar.

Finally we had a threatical dinosaur film that wasn't another Jurassic sequel and I loved the concept and idea of ancient astronauts landing on earth during the dinosaur age trying to survive. It should've been so much more.

I'm hoping Primitive War which is releasing this year makes up for it.

1k2fvng,reddit,My review on Chungking Express (1994),"Holy hell! What a ride that was.

First aspect to be noted is the absolutely perfect cinematography. Every shot perfectly encapsulates the chaos, impersonality and loneliness of big cities.

I was instantly captured by the first cop's views on heartbreak. The way he views the expiration date of the relationship and the reflection on the expiration date of memories is beautifully touching.

The scene of him calling a bunch of women to see if anyone wanted to go on a date with him almost felt like a foreshadowing of what became of the dating scene in a more modern world where everything is so fast and liquid. But here there is also a heartwarming side of it - how he is genuinely happy when one of the women says she is married. He doesnt want a hookup - just company. And thats what makes his character so relatable. His humbleness and positive outlook on life even when he is very clearly hurting and suffering.

And in the second part comes Faye Wong and California Dreamin. This second part is less mysterious and whimsical than the first one but the chemistry between the two actors and the sexiness of every innocent interaction is palpable through the screen.

The second cop talks to every element of his house as if he is talking to his lost love. So it seems appropriate that the character of Faye shows up to basically organize his life and take care of his apartment. 

The bittersweet element of the almost connection. Of the small little moments of connections and mismatches are carefully portrayed again beautifully capturing the city of Hong Kong, the late night diners, the coffees and beers as a living breathing character in the story. The big chaos of the city looking for a escape of the loneliness - just like our two characters.

The fact that she becomes a stewardess and is always traveling in the end portraits how things can change in the blink of an eye. People are unpredictable and independent. One day theyre here and in the other they are gone. Life just keeps going on. 

Its my first Wong Kar Wai movie and I was mesmerized through the whole thing. 

Would love to hear your thoughts.

What's more, I think they basically got it right about what happens after you die, which is pretty much in line with the Buddhist and Hindu beliefs in karma and reincarnation. However, I'd say the movie embraces too many superficial yuppie values from the 80s, with very little focus on how your actions affect others, not just yourself. What about the 30 or so people he accidentally killed on the bus? Shouldn't he have been punished for their deaths? And I think there's much more involved during the interim period between lifetimes than looking at a few critical days of your life to see what lessons you learned from them, in particular pertaining to dealing with fear. Sure, we all need to learn to deal with fear, which is a very big part of growth, but I think we need to learn a lot more lessons than just this, in particular, being responsible for the consequences of our actions, intentional or not, though intent carries a great deal more weight.

**Some Reviews:**

[JoBlo's Movie Network](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/573) \- [Chris Bumbray](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/chris-bumbray)

>Jason Statham and David Ayer have a nice thing going. *The Beekeeper* revitalized their careers to a certain extent, with Ayer putting a superb polish on what could have been a run-of-the-mill action flick, turning into perhaps Statham’s best solo action vehicle. And now, they’re back at it again with the Sylvester Stallone-penned *A Working Man*, which is based on the novel “Levon’s Trade” by Chuck Dixon (a way better title than the Seagal-like *A Working Man*). 

[Casey's Movie Mania](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/3688) \- [Casey Chong](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/casey-chong)

>Some of the shortcomings aside, it’s worth noting that A Working Man is the first part of Chuck Dixon’s *Levon Cade* series, which has so far released a total of 11 books. For now, the movie gets off to a decent, though uneven beginning for a franchise starter and if there’s a sequel in the pipeline — depending on the first movie’s box-office result, of course — here’s hoping it improves for the next round.

[The Guardian - Jesse Hassenger](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/mar/26/a-working-man-review-jason-statham)

>At its best, a movie like A Working Man functions as an update to the hard-boiled detective story, with a resilient bruiser conducting his own off-books missing-person investigation. There’s a little of that juice as Levon does some amateur undercover work as a drug buyer, cozying up to a motorcycle gang (the aforementioned leader sits on a chrome throne, another touch that feels like Ayer’s doing). But Stallone and Ayer don’t have the patience for too much skullduggery; skullsmashery is more their thing, and as an action movie, A Working Man doesn’t reach the giddy highs of Statham’s best.

[Screen Rant - Mary Kassel](https://screenrant.com/a-working-man-movie-review/)

>It doesn't take an active imagination to see where the future of *A Working Man* is going. A few plots are left unresolved. Levon still has to win custody of his young daughter, paving the way for a sequel or two if the film makes a profit. Statham has proved himself an asset at the box office, and when it comes to movies like *A Working Man*, a critical reception has little to do with the project's performance. It's a mindless good time, and I'll be interested to see where the franchise goes.

[NextBestPicture - Dan Bayer](https://nextbestpicture.com/a-working-man/)

>For better or worse, “A Working Man” is pure brute force, barrelling through its standard (if overstuffed) plot with the subtlety of a sledgehammer, pummeling you into submission with its hard-hitting (if uninspired) fight scenes. You may not be wowed by the action on display here, but you feel every single body blow and gunshot. That’s exactly what you expect from a Statham vehicle, and that’s what “A Working Man” delivers, even if it doesn’t give you any more than that.

[The Reel Bits - Richard Gray](https://thereelbits.com/2025/03/27/review-a-working-man/)

>While never destined to revolutionise the genre, Ayer and Stallone have struck upon a reliable formula in a ready-made franchise package. One could happily consume these like fast food every couple of years, safe in the knowledge that there’s always another job for this working man right around the corner.

[Deadline](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2256) \- [Pete Hammond](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/pete-hammond)

>Ayer has made a bunch of films I really liked, particularly the cop drama *End Of Watch* which had a better role for Pena opposite Jake Gyllenhaal, and Brad Pitt’s WW2 tank epic, *Fury.* Here as in *Beekeeper,* he delivers a tightly wound action showcase for his star and keeps it moving along.

[Variety](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/466) \- [Peter Debruge](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/peter-debruge)

>This wasn’t how I envisioned Ayer’s career shaping up... A few of his movies are very good, but it increasingly feels like he’s recycling old plots, the way straight-to-tape action movies did in the late 20th century.

Cruel Intentions: https://youtu.be/UzlKsS-IhEo?si=73QEZnZkFHTsKmat
 

- I like the way they blend music, and SMG is such a snake in this ... I love that it comes through in the feel of the movie. And gotta love that end cap scene, like trailers do. It's so representative of the movie and how tawdy and scandalous these characters are


Black Snake Moan: 
https://youtu.be/j7Z7Cf9IDGw?si=CFIIrIOBp9Zm0jSr


- I know a lot of people think this trailer gave the wrong impression of what the movie was actually about, but after seeing it I think it perfectly encapsulates what it's about. And the music is really well interwoven in it. But in particular I absolutely love the montage of Rhey giving into her vices, which I think a lot of us can relate to in one way or another for a lot of reasons. It's so colorful and punchy, and it's really cool how they edited it to mirror Rhey, giving it that pulpy vibe that's inherent in the movie's set up. Lastly, I think it's representative of how we glorify/romanticize hedonism (if that's the right word), despite how it might negatively impact our lives.

- Who didn't like this trailer? There's something special about it, with the song they used ... You can sense how impactful it should have been. But I personally suspect the reason people really vibe with it (and as is evidenced given the popularity of the character) is because it plays as though it's a story mainly revolving around Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn. I think there's something endearing about seeing people who exhibit different styles and qualities, which you get a wealth of here. It deepens people's sense of mystery and a person's complexity, but overall I think it's because she's high spirited, wild and free, while being kinda crazy that people see themselves (or who they wish they could be) in her ... A life force of epic proportions, going through the motions, but beautiful in their own peculiar and unique way. It's too bad the movie couldn't live up to this trailer.

- This is a great little trailer for a relatively obscure horror movie. The cover song really makes it, as does the editing. 
Note that this isn't the exact trailer I was looking for, which lessens it's impact as an audio-visual wonder in my book. There's something missing right before it cuts to the chorus and things ramp up ... The original trailer was less jarring than that.

1js7s1w,reddit,Let's discuss Lone Star [1996 dir John Sayles],"Just watched this movie that came out in 96. Chris Cooper. Kristofferson. McConaughey. Elizabeth Peña. Joe Morton. I've never seen this before and I loved it. 

A neo-western/drama/mystery about what happens in a small Texas border town when a skeleton is found near an army base. A Sheriff, himself the son of a legendary Sheriff of the same town, investigates and find out it's not just connected to the town's dark past but his own as well. 

Really good performances across the board, with an ending that comes out of nowhere and gives me caution from recommending it to everyone I know (if you've seen it, you know) and then it just ends. 

All in all, a solid story about the past, our legacies, and what comes next.

1jklhhf,reddit,The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie is One of the Best Animated Movies of the 2020s,"Absolutely loved it from start to finish. It promised everything and showcased why we love Looney Tunes especially on the big screen. This movie finally got the brand right as it did not need any celebrities, product placement, or anything pandering cranked up to 11.  
  
It had the full range of big screen theatrics from the eye-popping color palettes in each sequence to the symphonic musical score. Especially, there are some gags that have the full impact when with an audience. There are also some stand out sequences making full use of the medium, and it even shifts art styles from the movie including a sequence like the opening to Who Framed Roger Rabbit and an Art Deco style sequence that calls back to the Pink Elephants animation from Dumbo.  
  
Better than the last Space Jam movie, but overall, the best out of all theatrical Looney Tunes movies to date. I can't describe how well written it is from being an homage and spoof of 1950s sci-fi B movies to a self contained story focusing on Porky and Daffy's friendship exclusively for this movie. It works as a buddy comedy, and I loved what they did with Petunia in terms of her character and the romance subplot with Porky. Everything is built on Porky and Daffy's connection throughout. It works more in comparison to Bugs missing the Tunes when in fact he rarely interacts with them since the original shorts don't have them crossover.  
  
All movie exclusive characters were excellent. Farmer Jim, The Invader, and even the Scientist all had a huge part to play in the movie especially for the comedy.  
  
There are a lot of jokes coming in the moment the opening credits started to roll. For a PG rated family movie, they definitely have stuff adults can enjoy. References to John Carpenter movies like The Thing and They Live, some off-color humor, and it does not feel juvenile. There is subtle commentary coming from Petunia about taking risks and not wanting to be bland. I get that.  
  
The first time I saw it had plenty of audible laughs in the auditorium. There are plenty of surprises, twists, and stand out moments that showcase the animators going above and beyond what was supposed to be a made for TV/streaming movie. And I'm glad they reverted back to its original title, otherwise ""Bubble Brains"" would have been a tough sell.  
  
You have a lot to invest in, the stakes are convincing, and whatever movie conventions it tries doing, you couldn't help but smile the whole way through.

  
This movie is a monumental achievement in 2D animation and the comedy genre on its own. It will looked back as a cult classic, probably a potential pick on AFI's Top 100 Funniest Movies / Greatest Animated Movies list.",2025-03-26 20:15:21,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,12,8,,0.66,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jklhhf/the_day_the_earth_blew_up_a_looney_tunes_movie_is/,rwinger24

I've never been exposed to this many neurological disorders as I got after I completed watching this movie (better for a med student definitely).

Randall, a god in sales; 15 mins into the movie and he becomes jobless due to his other god-tier skill : swaying girls - cut - sitting around a table with his overly qualified family of medical background, celebrating his younger brother's success. He joins Pfizer, get beaten up by the ex-marine, Trey *but also* gets the main gurl - Maggie whe has Parkinson.

Now what I loved about this movie was —

- Randall wanting sex only gradually fell for her
- his anxious proposal which she turns down ergo
- his life becoming mundane and him waiting for her bus which moved Maggie
- their budding relationship; the cherry blossom stage all good all sweet
- comes the convention and acceptance phase altogether and 
- him taking her around to get her cured and her breaking up with him

Okay, everyone wants to feel love but the burden and responsibilities that come with it, fewer wish to tackle them.

1k5hw6m,reddit,"5 Centimeters Per Second, if you stare at the campfire too long you'll watch the whole world go by.","I just seen this movie, the more and more I think about it the more and more it gets to me, it's message is so sad and it's ending unfulfilling and that's what makes it so good.

It's an anime movie from 2007 by Makoto Shinkai (Your Name, Weathering With You, Suzume etc.)

This movie is extremely realistic and gut wrenching, a story about how important it is to move on because if you stand still you'll end up choking yourself physically and mentally and you won't find any peace.

It's extremely impressive how powerful and heartbreaking this story is even though it's only 1 hour.

Spoilers ahead:

Maybe it's because I'm a guy as well but I had assumed Akari would be waiting for him too, or they'd at least maintain contact and try to give themselves a chance at least once. Like Takaki, the idea of her moving on and choosing to keep him in the past was unexpected and heartbreaking, but what hurt even more was realizing that all that time he spent thinking about her and staring back into what was and yearning/chasing for that moment, he missed so many opportunities to live his life to the fullest, while to her he is merely a memory and has moved on. And the fact that they spent the same night together and had the same feelings for one another all those years ago makes it so much worse. I can't shake this feeling of emptiness and lack of closure after watching this movie, and I'm now realizing that's exactly how Tataki feels.

The train scene is what brings it all together, Tataki choosing to look back because he's been longing for that moment and person from long ago and hasn't moved on so much time later. Akari, while realizing it could very well be him, keeps walking, choosing to keep him in the past as she did.....long ago

On one hand I'm frustrated at Akari for forgetting so easily and leaving Takaki in this state of limbo in his life, but she doesn't know that, how could she? Why should she? And how should she be expected to put her life on pause? It's heartbreaking but the world moves on. Her choosing to press on is completely understandable. Why hold on to a fleeting memory for so long? The time they shared should be cherished but life goes on, Takaki should've realized this and not choke himself everyday for someone he lost contact with ages ago.

But on the other hand I understand Takaki's perspective too, to care for something so much and not get proper closure, and to know for the rest of your life you won't ever get to conclude that core part of your childhood from so long ago is so frustrating and unfulfilling. The feeling of desire you will never be able to shake or move on from must be so hard. Hard enough to look past the things you have going for you now and zone in on something you will never be able to reach, not even a centimeter closer.

At first I was like ""that was neat"" but the more I think about this movie the more I cherish it. I can't shake this tale lmao this movie has you thinking about it the same way the protag thinks about what was and what he longed for from his past. But you shouldn't, you can't, the moments gone, it's in the past. It's important to grow, move on, push forward, because if you don't you are only hurting yourself and the people who want to be in your life. Let it go and keep walking into the uncertainty of the future, one centimeter at a time.",2025-04-22 21:19:21,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,11,4,,0.72,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1k5hw6m/5_centimeters_per_second_if_you_stare_at_the/,WantedOutlaw

1k01322,reddit,Forrest Gump and importance of shoes,"While the film Forrest Gump has an obvious connection to shoes via his famous Nikes and the opening dialogue, I've noticed it continues deeper throughout. The film makes reference to shoes both through dialogue and visuals, a few of which I'm only noticing recently, which are as follows:

Gump's line to the first visitor on the bench about being able to tell a lot about a person by their shoes, to which she replies that her feet hurt. The woman is dressed as a housekeeper of some kind, and even though Forrest compliments their quality, she suffers. I believe this is making social commentary, whether it be about the struggle of the working class, or maybe about perspective on life, I haven't fully dissected.

Gump's own first shoes are connected to braces, maybe this speaks on perseverance in the face of adversity.

When Forrest and Bubba meet Lieutenant Dan, he tells them to take care of their feet and shoes due to rainfall and gangrene.

Lieutenant Dan loses his feet and is then completely lost in life, and mentions his struggling with the phrase ""walk with god"".

Lieutenant Dan only reconciles with his life after relinquishing to the ocean, effectively being off his legs altogether.

When Jenny is facing the decision to commit suicide, she is depicted standing on a ledge in the most flimsy, ankle-breaking heeled sandals, that teeter, which then snaps her to save herself. I think this might be speaking on the stability of her life or mental state.

Jenny is the one that gives Forrest his favorite shoes during what he calls the happiest time of his life. When she leaves he spends 3+ years with the shoes, running.

Jenny throws her shoes at her father's house. Her feet are filthy. Forrest's shoes are pristine.

Lieutenant Dan shows Forrest his new ""magic legs"", wearing very nice shoes, as he reveals a complete change in outlook on life.

The feather is shown at Forrest's feet at both the opening and ending.

There could be more; please comment if you think of any!

1jqjrau,reddit,Highly recommend the Regal Unlimited pass,"I’m no shill for Regal, and have some problems with their lack of independent/lesser known films, for the record. 

I have recently quit drinking (91 days), and as a result, I have been sleeping much better, and therefore have been simply just having more time. The escapism and love of seeing films in a theater has been an even more intense passion, as it helps me deal with sobriety and provides a much-needed activity to steer the planning of my days around something other than drinking.

Anyway the Regal pass, for me here in Washington state, is $24.99. I am having a blast, taking on a fun challenge of trying to see literally every movie I possibly can. Definitely things I would never normally see or have zero interest in.

For instance, yesterday I went to the library for a bit, and at the theater next door realized the timing was perfect and just went to see Paddington In Peru on a whim. Because it was there. It was delightful! I am a 44 year old man without kids, and I would never have seen that otherwise. Then I took my dad to see the late show of the movie Locked last night, which i had wanted to see. We had a private screening, just the two of us!

After work and errands etc today, I’m going to see Captain America, and will probably be the only person in theater. I couldnt possibly care less about most comic book/Marvel movies, but hey, maybe it’ll be surprise me.

Anyway, just wanted to mention how fun it is to have the option of just randomly going to any movie any time. The thing has paid for itself after two visits.

1jmof6x,reddit,What movies would you recommend for older family members who haven’t really been exposed to films or literature throughout their lives?,"Looking for movies with which everyone should be familiar

My in laws are immigrants from a very rural area, “parents were subsistence farmers in the mountains” rural, and their academic education did not make it very far. 

As such, their exposure to literature, both written and filmed, has been limited. 

They’re very intelligent people, they watch the evening news every day and have no problem keeping up with the intricacies of *why* things happen, and can relate things happening in the US easily between patterns they’ve seen in El Salvador. 

However, their life experience has been limited to things they have personally experienced, and I believe the great value of literature is expanding our world beyond the lived experience. (I consider films to be literature, not just books)

As such, we would like to come up with a list of essentially the western canon, but in film. 

What are the movies you think everyone should watch, movies that set up or include structures seen in other works, movies that expose people to classic storylines, even if not the original story, and movies that are, above all, entertaining?

Bonus points if the movie is known to have a great Spanish dub. We want to avoid subtitles for now. 

Shrek would be a movie I consider part of the western canon, for example, and it has a great Spanish dub, but I would not feel it’s a good option to start them with it given that it requires knowledge or familiarity fairy tales, fantasy tropes, and satire to enjoy.

So, with this in mind, what are some films you think would be good for the goal of exposing our parents to these movies and build up their cultural knowledge, worldly experience, and enjoyment?",2025-03-29 15:12:29,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,13,41,,0.69,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jmof6x/what_movies_would_you_recommend_for_older_family/,JulioCesarSalad

1k1yh3u,reddit,[spoilers] Rewatched the Green Mile last night after finishing the audiobook,"I love how the movie really has you questioning your own morality in places. If I'd read Delacroix's crime on a reddit headline, I'd think exactly like those watching his execution. Yet seeing it in person, especially with how badly it went, well. No human deserves that.

Then again, his seven victims, even accidental ones, didn't deserve their fates either.

Another puzzle: Percy. He's such a disgusting scum guzzling slimeball that I can't help feel an odd perverse joy whenever he's bullied or assaulted in this movie. It's fun seeing him in pain when he's getting his ears tugged or the whimpers he makes in the restraint room. None of that compares to what he did to Del (and Mr. Jingles), and he likely never was punished as a child so it's long overdue.

Then I have to wonder: if I'm enjoying his pain, does that make me, on some level, as bad as him? For stepping on a mouse & tormenting a rapist/murderer does that make Wharton's sexual assault of Percy ""okay""? Did he deserve Coffey's ""punishment"", before he could go on to torment mentally ill patients at the asylum?

So many questions and no right or wrong answers, really. 

I cried three times tonight tho I know this film almost by heart. First at Del's execution, then at John watching the movie and lastly, of course, at John's execution. The awestruck, almost childlike joy in John watching the movie actually made me mourn a little. How I miss the days of simply enjoying things without, well, gestures vaguely at Current Events.

1k0bfur,reddit,Thoughts on Swiss Army Man ending?,"I loved the movie. It was so tender and sweet and funny. But I didn't like that in the third act it seems like Paul Dano's character has just been living in the woods behind Sarah's house. It made the character a lot harder to sympathize with. A guy hiding in the woods behind your house making dolls that look like you is terrifying.

One of the themes is learning to accept yourself and not be ashamed of being weird. But stalking someone is weird and absolutely something to be ashamed of. It feels like the movie sabotages its own message.

Was this just the Daniels trying to make the story as bizarre as possible? I get that Dano's character is supposed to be weird and maladjusted and moderately creepy, but why take it that far?

I feel like so many stories and movies start with an amazing concept but then ruin it by not stopping sooner and making the story too complicated.

Why doesn't he tell him?

I am confused now. I thought the plan was to maintain the con even after it ended. But the fake FBI agent says, ""Hello Henry,"" so Lonnegan definitely knows that his name is Henry and not Shaw.

I threw it into my Blu Ray player while feeling quite sick and did not expect very much. I am quite sceptical when it comes to superhero movies nowadays. But this one surprised me.

It tells a multidimensional story while staying simple enough for newcomers. With Kingpin and his supporters, not only does that story find a very well defined villain but also a clear direction in which it heads without having to tease some other stories along the way. 

Together with the soundtrack, which is filled with hip hop, it also manages to draw the feelings of a teenager and the conflicts he has to endure in a surprisingly empathic and realistic manner, so that the audience can easily connect to the protagonist.

The imagery is flawless. It's a living and moving comic panel, full of creativity and heart. The style changes quickly along the action yet it does not overwhelm the viewer so that they can follow along. 

All in all, it's a good movie that made use of its origins. I can understand why it's so beloved around cinephiles.

1k5g26m,reddit,Mistrial (1996) is one of the most eye-rolling movies I've ever watched.,"This movie is basically if somebody saw 12 Angry Men and went but what if the jury was a buncha meanies and that's why you can't trust them :(

  
While it started out pretty solid, it went off the rails pretty quickly around 15-minutes in.

SPOILERS AHEAD FOR THIS MOVIE IF YOU ACTUALLY CARE TO WATCH (please don't):

The ""Hero"" of this movie played by Bill Pullman (what a waste of talent) who is in charge of an investigation of the homicide of two police officers. The first half of the movie revolves around his hunt for the perpetrator which leads him to the suspect who is an ex of one of the officers. Emotionally viscerated by the brutality of the crime, our hero decides to forgo proper procedures, catches the ex trying to flee which leads to a fight which leads to OUR HERO SHOOTING DOWN THE INNOCENT WIFE AND BROTHER of the ex. This ends with him getting a bag of evidence with some letters and bullet casings from the suspect. The second half of the movie is basically a legal drama about how the mean justice system discarded these evidence under unlawful search and seizure with no warrant. (He shot those two people in their own home where they lived with the suspect btw), which eventually leads to a jury finding the suspect Not Guilty.

NOW, at this point in the movie where I was FULLY interested (and a bit annoyed at our hero cop's personality) in how will they solve this case legally and get to the truth. OUR HERO SHOOTS A GUN IN THE COURTROOM right after the verdict is announced and TAKES THE JURY, JUDGE AND THE SUSPECT AS HOSTAGE. 

This third half of the movie that just went COMPLETELY off the rails is basically more than half hour of mostly a one-sided soapbox peachy speech about how the poor police officer got messed over because of stupid things like """"rule of law"""" and """"procedure"""". In the meantime outside the courtroom, the hallways are packed with armed police, paramedics and a hostage negotiator. The movie makes it an explicit point about showing how so many cops didn't wanted to go inside to subdue our hero because ""they don't want to shoot another cop"" because I kid you not one of them says ""That could've been me chief, I've been in some situations"".  Let me repeat that in this movie MULTIPLE officers of the law REFUSED to engage in an ACTIVE HOSTAGE SITUATION with multiple people at risk because they were afraid they might hesitate the take the shot. 

and that isn't even the most infuriating scene in the movie, no no no the honor of most jaw dropping awe inspiringly bullshit line in the movie comes when the police commissioner of our hero manages to get inside the courtroom to talk him down, which leads to Our hero of this story, our protector of the law to utter the lines :

""He killed two cops, And what's worse, he made me kill.""

The utter lack of remorse and guilt and the hand-wavyness reaction of once again THE PROTAGONIST over his killing of TWO INNOCENT CIVILLIANS, is just showed as ""part of the hardships of fighting crime"". 

To call this pile of mess a copaganda film would be a disservice to other movies and tv shows that actually make people WANT to become police officers because I refuse to believe this movie can be seen as any other way than highlighting the nature of law enforcement to support problematic elements just because they belong in the same line of work.  This is not my opinion btw, this is literally what's inferred by one of the lines in the movie : 

""You know why they hate us, Captain?

Because we have a code.

We believe in something.

We believe in each other."" 

Treating the refusal of holding someone you know accountable for their actions as ""betraying the code"".

The movie ends (thank god) with him finally surrendering while having achieved nothing.

He let the killer walk because of unlawful arrest, He killed two innocent civilians during said arrest, he destroyed his life and the life  of his wife and two kids, He got MULTIPLE OFFICERS either fired or demoted for not following orders and worst of all he wasted my time on this earth that I spent watching this godawful movie hoping any second it might turn around and give me a surprise of being an actually good one.

1jv91gs,reddit,Spaceman (2024),"I just discovered this movie a couple days ago, watched it yesterday. It was emotionally overwhelming, the first time in years that I've shed a tear or two. Easily one of the best experiences I had in a while. Then I check out IMDB just to see a baffling 5.7 rating.

It's a really slow burn, very different from a usual Adam Sandler movie, Paul Dano is otherworldly, the visuals are not grandiose but excellent for this scale. I think it all fits together very well to bring home some powerful messages about loneliness, guilt, connection, what it's like to be a flawed human.

The grainy looks and old-new tech gives it some realism that usually is missing from modern movies.

I'll keep this spoiler free, if you got curious, please go in blind. I just wish we had more films like this, it hurts to see such low ratings, basically telling studios to keep going with shiny slop.",2025-04-09 15:47:51,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,11,5,,0.7,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jv91gs/spaceman_2024/,Csenky

Visually, it's stunning. There's something about the way it captures isolation and the weird intimacy between the people and animals that feels super unique. It's not really like The Northman plot-wise, but if you were into the raw, mythic, earthy vibe of that movie, you might really dig this one.

1jna7fg,reddit,"Thinking of a game name, and I confused myself into thinking it was something else.","So, back in the 90s pretty much when ps1 was released I remember playing(trying to at least) a game that I thought was 'Time Commando' except... Its not that. 

The reason I'm trying to remember is because I could not get past the literally first few screens. 

Somethings I remember :

It was 3rd person. 
I only managed to see like 3 different screens, and it was like a mystery type game where I had to collect stuff. (I think) 
Bright colours, nothing dark. 
I remember there being a wooden boat, like canoe style. 
Male character.

The screens were like, male char walk in a direction, into a different screen. And I remember going back and forth between the same 3 screens for days. Then I gave up. 

I was probably like 6-7? So my memory is super hazy and all of it could be wrong; but I'm hoping someone may be able to shed some light. 

I even went through an entire list of games on the Web, but could not find it. I swear it was something like time commando, but it's not that game. I understand this is not a lot of info, but thought I'd give this sub a bash. 

P.s it may well have been the Sega megadrive, but I swear it was ps1

Edit: the male char was a white slim human male, and I remember him maybe wearing blue? That last bit could be wrong though.

2nd edit: it is eerily similar to Ark of Time. Almost to a tee, but I just don't remember it like that. I'm not sure if this is some weird childhood memory issue that I've got. But man the scenes I can remember just not the screens from Ark of Time.

☑️ Xbox Series X is my main console, for their 1st party games (Sea of Thieves, Grounded, Forza Horizon 5, Halo, Gears, Crackdown, etc), all the 3rd party games, and Game Pass, which is amazing. Also, 4K Blu-rays.      

☑️ PS5 for their 1st party games and playing old PS1, PS2, and PS3 games via PS+. I love playing games like 'Marvel's Spider-Man' and 'Syphon Filter' on it.      

☑️ Switch for Nintendo's exclusives, obviously.       

☑️ Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold for mobile games and Google Play Pass. Also, Xbox cloud and console streaming. I still can't believe this phone has 16GB of RAM. Blows my mind.              

☑️ Meta Quest 3 for VR, obviously. Also, Xbox Game Pass via Cloud Gaming. 

☑️ My Windows 11 gaming PC because it's kind of a monster and it pairs very nicely with Xbox PC Game Pass. Also, Steam. I hope those next-gen Xbox rumors are true.                

☑️ Google Stadia controller because RIP Stadia, but it's also *such* a nice controller to use on Android and Windows PC.

In Stars and Time is a great example of a game where you only get one choice on what to say and--guess what? It's great.

The games you dive into when you're waiting for that casserole to bake, and the stuff you play that you can just leave anytime and dive back-in. Does not absolutely have to be an RPG.

Risen  
Gothic 3  
Freelancer  
Noita  
modded Bethesda games  
Everspace  
Starsector

1jnvnuc,reddit,"Atomfall: Shallow, tedious, and unrewarding.","Overall, I’m going to give the game a 5/10. It’s super addicting at first, and the exploration is novel, if not highly restrictive. The lack of a mini map wouldn’t be so bad if you didn’t have to press THREE buttons just to open the regular map. 

Combat is one of the worst parts of the game, as it gets very tedious very quickly. There is no progression in the game as weapon upgrade barely do anything noticeable, and you leave almost every fight with less than you had before you started. Stealth is available, but it’s janky AF, and you’ll get spotted if you come within 100 feet of an enemy. Lack of armor or other gear means you can never close the equipment gap, especially with the enemies in the third area, and the main story area. 

Oh, and enemies respawn anytime you leave one of the hub areas, and seemingly pop up out of nowhere. More often than not, I’ll scout an area, find 5-6 enemies, only to have 10 more pop up seemingly out of nowhere once the fighting starts. 

Weapon variety is disappointing to say the least, and as I said; upgrades never really feel like actual upgrades. Skill points have to be found because combat gives no exp, and none of them make you go “yeah, the game is better now that I have this!”

The story…exists. All of this to say that I’ve hit the 10 hour mark, feel like I’m about 60% done, and I don’t even want to finish. Only play this game if you want an extra chore that you’ll feel obligated to finish.

Edit 2: There are some really good suggestions, but we probably wont be playing games like Helldivers 2 because it would require each having their own system, but they have an Xbox and PS5 and Xbox doesnt have Helldivers 2. So only 2 can play that game. This would have been a good rec otherwise and we would have played in an easier difficulty.

1k44q8v,reddit,Game Recommendations For a 60+ Retiree,"Hello everyone, as you could probably guess from the title, I am in search of video game recommendations for my 60+ year old retired mother.

Now for some background information, I got my mother into gaming at a stressful point in her work career which was also near the end of her professional life. At this point, these games were fairly simple, cozy, and relaxing. They were an escape from the stress. This mostly was taken up by Animal Crossing New Horizons. 

Now that my mother has retired, the stress of a full time job is gone and her time is free. She’s really adapted well to this change, and has also picked up gaming at an alarming pace. By this I mean, she has sunk 300+ hours between TOTK and BOTW, as well as a good chunk of time in Echoes of Wisdom. Evidently a Zelda fan. Outside of Zelda she has also enjoyed and completed Hogwarts Legacy and Witcher 3 to which she said “it felt too short”.  She’s currently replaying Witcher. 

Currently she only has a switch, but I am helping her look into getting a PC since she really has been enjoying gaming especially in her retirement.

From what she has told me, The Witcher 3 is her favourite game so far with the Zelda series being close behind. In terms of preference from a broader sense, she enjoys games that provide an adventure, a good story, and a somewhat cinematic experience. Difficulty wise, she’s been ramping up, she enjoyed the combat to The Witcher, but she can get overwhelmed and stressed out when games have too many different button inputs, or overwhelming combat. 

Please let me know some good game recommendations that she could play on switch.",2025-04-21 04:07:29,gaming,gaming,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,21,109,,0.62,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1k44q8v/game_recommendations_for_a_60_retiree/,TheSpecialApple

My son would like to have all his buddies over for a gaming themed & focused ""LAN Party"". Has anyone else done on for their kid(s)? How did you go about it, and what types of ideas did you have? Were there any unexpected challenges?  
  
All his 6 friends he's inviting has a console at home, and we only have the one Xbox but have access to multiple TVs - so my thoughts are to inquire if the parents would be willing to let their kids bring their console/controller? 

Other cool Idea's I've though up are having ChatGPT create 'e-sports style logos' of their gamer names and printing stuff (ie: cups, maybe shirts) with their logo on it at their stations. 

Fortnite is the game they'll likely be playing. 

I do have 2g WIFI and ethernet cables to take the load off WIFI. 

Other than that, just ordering a bunch of gamer-themed decorations and making sure they're all in the same room close to the router.

1k4or57,reddit,Sonic as a Metroidvania - The Perfect Game formula for a New Direction in the Series?,"Hear me out;

A re-imagining of a 2D Sonic game. think of a world in the vein of games like Ori and the Blind forest, Hollow Knight et al. Incredible 2D visuals with the upgrade gameplay formula of Super Metroid, You play as Sonic, you're dropped into a mysterious new island, you have a huge 2D open world to explore, you need to gather the chaos emeralds which have been scattered all over, with each granting you a new ability, the game has different biomes instead of traditional linear  levels or 'Zones' and 'Acts' with A to B gameplay. The standard metroidvania gameplay loop is intact allowing certain areas and biomes to be accessed when new abilities are discovered.

The reason why I think this is perfect:

* The giant open world is perfect for the gimmick - speed and traversal + exploration, something the classic stage/zone formula fails to balance correctly due to the constrained limitations of each linear level, affecting the 'flow' of the game, instead of A - B gameplay, you must backtrack and explore and familiarize yourself with the world - the game world can be perfectly designed for his abilities without the usual annoying hurdles found in linear levels, areas can be seamless instead. The map can be designed with much more care and attention.

* Chaos emeralds are literally the perfect item for collecting in key areas to regain an ability - unlock spin dash - unlock speed rush - unlock homing attack, super sonic? - etc. etc., A boss can be fought at each emerald location.

* Rings can be collected as healing, dispersed when defeating basic enemies in the overworld, they actually serve some purpose other than a glorified 1-hit shield.

* One of the main problems people have with the older games in a 2D space is a conflict of objectives, they think you're supposed to race to the end as quick as possible since it's all about speed, just to run into egregiously placed enemy and/or spikes and stuff causing for irritating and unclear objectives, there is no need for that in an open end-to-end world design, speed can co-exist with exploration much more naturally.

* With the idea of upgrade abilities allowing increased speed and finesse of movement, past areas can be blasted through with ease and lower level enemies dispatched as you become stronger, again lending a better gameplay feel; the sense of speed and abilities of his character, something which again is constrained as an idea in the older level-based approach with poor balance.

The whole identity of a 2D sonic game is intact, loop-de-loops and all, it just opens up a whole new design potential and allows better curation for that style of game in the 2D formula, being able to interact with the world and change the world through your actions is huge.

It can't just be me who feels this, the Metroidvania genre is practically crying out for a Sonic game! It almost feels made for it.",2025-04-21 21:09:57,gaming,gaming,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,25,42,,0.61,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1k4or57/sonic_as_a_metroidvania_the_perfect_game_formula/,InfiniteAir

For me, I really had to sit and think. The reason this one would shock me is because I loved this game as a kid and also because the franchise is effectively dead so seeing it come back would be amazing.

1jxulqc,reddit,Is there a genre for games like this?,"So I recently played a few games that I have ABSOLUTELY fallen in love with, and I wanted to see if this is actually part of a broader genre or not.  The two games are Wayfinder and Dungeons of Sundaria.  Basically, these games are multiplayer dungeon crawlers where you complete short, 5-30min PvE dungeons that have traditional MMO-style mechanics (lots of boss mechanics, a focus on optimizing skill rotations, active dodging, etc.).  Unfortunately ,development for both games has unofficially stopped.  Wayfinder suffered from some launch issues that gave it a rough start, and Dungeons of Sundaria is run by a indie team that may or may not have had the resources to support it long-term.

Is there a name for this genre?  Are there other games that offer similar styles of gameplay?

  
I have tried a few games that are in similar niches such as Deep Rock Galactic and Vermintide.  However, these are all far more FPS-heavy, don't really have anything to speak of for boss mechanics, and have essentially no traditional RPG-style skills or gear progression.  Rabbit and Steel is the closest alternate game I've found, but it is a roguelike with minimal meta progression or gearing.  The key mechanics that set the games I'm interested in apart are:

* Multiplayer w/ PvE focus
* RPG-style gear/character build progression
* MMO-style skills and multiple class roles

1k602ee,reddit,Does anyone else find the idea of sandbox games more exciting than actually playing them?,"I found myself wanting to play some kind of sandbox game that involved building or managing a kingdom in some way, and after a lot of googling and faffing around I came across a game called Saelig. Which is essentially medieval Kenshi. A sandbox, medieval life simulator in essence where you start your life as whatever you want to be and do whatever the hell you want.

But what I've found is that I apparently lack imagination. I boot it up with grand intentions of giving my character this backstory and personality traits with certain ambitions. But then I end up just sort of... doing nothing. 

I dunno what it is. Maybe it's a matter of immersion that gets easily shattered by clunky controls and mechanics usually present in these games. Or perhaps it's a time thing. As a working adult I don't have the time to fully indulge myself in these games. Even when I have the time you never know when something will come up that needs to be done.

I also think perhaps that I expect too much from these games. I think I want the world to feel more alive and react to my character and itself more than current games allows so that they can't be ""gamed"" in a sense, because after a while you figure the mechanics out and there's no real surprise or intrigue left. It just becomes ""Do this to be able to do this so I can do this"" etc.

Anyone else have a similar experience?

Metro: Exodus is my all time favorite game. However, on the hardest difficulty they disable manually saving, and require you to complete 2 30+ minute long stealth levels without getting spotted or killing anyone. Making it 80% through and then having to restart the whole process from scratch killed me. 

Second is DOOM(2016). I'm a proud member of r/patientgamers as it fits my busy lifestyle. I only recently got a chance to start this game. I grew up with doom PVP and unreal tournament. Thus far I'm loving the combat and chaos, BUT, I was expecting non-stop demon slaying. Not going more than 2 minutes without brutal demon slaughter. Unfortunately for me, the game really rewards thoughtful exploration, platforming, and inspecting every little corner of every map if you want to really get all the good shit. It takes away from the mindless fun because I'm constantly worried that I'm not getting the most out of the game. Honestly if it would have been more or a linear power fantasy I'd be so much more satisfied.

He's expressed some interest in maybe using some of the old consoles I stashed back there for when I come to visit. I'm just at a loss as to what games to suggest he play since he's never gamed in his life, so is literally stating from zero. 

Couple of minor restrictions. The less reading the better, and he can get frustrated pretty easily. So, I'm basically looking for a kids game, where it's all but impossible to lose, and the controls are very simple, that would appeal to someone retirement age. 

Assuming they all still work, I've got an OG/360/One, and PS2 & PS4 stashed back there. Think I also have an N64 and GC, and I may even still have my 3DS around here somewhere. Ideally I'm looking for titles that could be found in like the bargain bin of a GameStop type store, so they're cheap and if he doesn't like them it's no big loss, but digital isn't out of the question on the One/PS4.

1jocrk8,reddit,S.T.A.L.K.E.R. - Shadow of Chernobyl,"I played this game years ago when it came out. It was from a time when games were more or less linear.

I found it really funny (and confusing) at the time, only later found that the game had like 3 possible endings. More recently have been reflecting on the value of giving to others, and that ending has been replaying in my mind. Has stuck with me. I wonder if it's reflective of how I live my life.

1k6sqf0,reddit,Need advice on time sinks games that aren’t button intensive,"So I had for years played mostly competitive shooter games but I just can’t do them anymore. I’ve played on keyboard and mouse and controller (depending on the game) from anything from cod to Fortnite but after multiple hand injuries I just can’t play those types of games anymore.

Now the hand injuries aren’t related to gaming but over the years between work (I’m an equipment mechanic) and sports I’ve broken multiple fingers a wrist and ended up with arthritis in both hands. 

I don’t wanna bore you with the details anymore though, I still enjoy gaming but playing games that require constant and quick inputs just isn’t really do able for me anymore so I was looking for some suggestions on different types of games that I can put a lot of time into that won’t require as much precision and finger dexterity. 

I can’t really say exactly what type of game I like because I’ve mostly played multiplayer fps games. Going back as far as cs 1.6 (and combat arms, how I miss you) all the way up until most recently black ops 6 and apex and a ton of stuff inbetween. The only non multiplayer fps games I’ve played in the last like 15 years were various resident evil games and the tomb raider remakes.

I’m looking for something single player that I can just put some time into after work each day for an hour or 2. I primarily use an xbox but I do also have a gaming pc with a 3060 and i5 12400 so either Xbox or pc would be fine for suggestions. 

I want to try new things so I’ll be down for whatever good suggestions people have. ",2025-04-24 13:51:23,gaming,gaming,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,8,173,,0.61,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1k6sqf0/need_advice_on_time_sinks_games_that_arent_button/,Brick_Grimes

Nearing the end of my second full playthrough of the game, and I find myself really wanting more of this specific genre of the genre.

1ju1y0a,reddit,Looking for game recommendations similar to Hollow Knight.,"So I am looking for games with similar gameplay to Hollow Knight. It was my first metroidvania. Currently stuck trying to beat Pantheon 5 though.

I have played both Ori games and found the second to be the best. The fighting mechanics weren't my favorite but it was fun. The movement abilities to make exploring faster was great.

I am almost done with Nine Sols. At the final boss. The game is enjoyable more than it is not, but after going back to Hollow Knight after a few weeks of this game made me appreciate Hollow Knight more. The fighting just feels so much more smooth compared to Nine Sols.

I tried Animal Well. Was not my favorite and dropped it before beating it.

I have played other platformers. Downwell was great, leap year was a little enjoyable. I played Webbed. Was trying to 100% it, never beat it. I did not like how hard it was to back track in the tree area...

I currently have Celeste, Blade Kitten (played, like, haven't beaten yet), Inside, Limbo.

But I know none of them have gameplay similar to Hollow Knight. It doesn't have to be a Metroid or Platformer or 2D. Just more games with fast and smooth boss fights like Hollow Knight would be appreciated.

1k1h9kz,reddit,Does anyone know of game journal/diary apps?,"I honestly had no idea where to go for this and all my searches have turned up the wrong things so far so maybe you guys might know something I don’t. Something I would really like to find if at all possible is an app on either iOS or Android (I have an iPhone and a Galaxy Tab) where I can write\* my own journal entries and keep track of various things while I play. I really struggle a lot these days with games especially with games of my favourite genre of RPGs, and I really need things that can help me manage my memory.

I know that things like Notion or even the notes app exist but they don’t really seem to have what I’m looking for. The closest I’ve seen is something like Shattered Ring for Elden Ring. One of the things that makes apps like Notion less ideal is how they are set up and layed out. Also Shattered Ring is more specific and I am hoping to find something that can be used across games. Either it would be generic enough while still game focused or it would be able to change its setup per game. A final thing I’m hoping to find is the ability to Dictate to the app from the lock or Home Screen via a shortcut or widget. This would mean I could easily talk my thoughts as I am playing without having to stop and type.

Thanks for listening to this odd one and hopefully someone out there knows of something that will work

1jztbpv,reddit,A REVELATION: The movie Gremlins and Ape Escape,"I can't believe that there has not been a (modern) video game for Gremlins. In addition to this, I also think that Ape Escape's type of gameplay is almost perfect for a Gremlins game, give or take a few changes to the mechanics. Check it:

\- In Ape Escape, you run around capturing apes that have been let loose and are running and hiding across several maps. Swap out the apes with gremlins (duh), instead of capturing apes, you're killing gremlins, make the main character (Billy or Kate, each who have a skill that the other does not), and make the maps different locations from the films and a few more places.

\- Like Ape Escape, it would be a third-person view so you can see the character model you're playing as. Shit, add a photo mode with fun poses and faces so you can take photos of yourself with the different gremlins you're hunting!

\- Ape Escape is a kid-friendly game whereas Gremlins is, of course, a dark comedy/monster movie. The game should absolutely be the same, with the jokes, language, and violent ways of dispatching gremlins (Blender, guns, electricity, traps, sunlight, etc.) the monster violence would be gratuitous and over the top, just like in the movies. 

\- Think of all of the different gremlin designs throughout all the movies! Mogwai (duh), The spider, the bat, Mohawk, Greta, Stripe, Daffy, the vegetable gremlin, and all of the other ones I can't remember... Some of them could be level bosses or can only be caught in specific ways (like in Ape Escape, where some run and hide, some attack, and others just run around)

\- You could have a level where after you rescue Mogwai (perhaps a final level), there's a gremlin (boss) that is spraying water at you and you have to avoid getting Mogwai wet -- If you get hit with water more gremlins spawn from him. In order to beat the level, you have to kill all of the gremlins and the boss. 

\- There can be little side missions to do on every level: rescue NPCs from gremlins, find old books and ancient artifacts that show gremlins throughout history, collect multiple weapon parts to build a special weapon for each level, prevent a gremlin from touching water in time to avoid more gremlins spawning, etc.

\- The levels could be the many different locales from the movies: Billy's house/neighborhood, the movie theater, the Clamp Center lab, the YMCA, the bank, New York City, etc. 

Thank you for reading my video game pitch. I will happily accept a position at your game development studio now.

Me and my partner have been playing Project Zomboid where we set a location as a target where they must get to while the other person hunts them down. We set a couple challenges like she has to find 3 items before she can enter the final location to get to the finish line etc.

I was wondering if this sort of mode could be done with other games, I instantly thought GTA Online could work we could race across the map and maybe set a couple challenges as long the way or checkpoints.

Do you guys have any other good open world multiplayer games where this could also potentially work?

1k2l85e,reddit,How no HUD-mode made a average game a great one. [Avowed],"When Avowed released about 2 months ago I played it because I was looking for a new game to scratch my RPG itch. I put it down after 10 hours and felt like it was realy avarage but solid.

I enjoyed it's meele combat especialy with the classic board and sword loadout. It took some time getting used to the whole combat system but while simple on the surface it has some depth to it. Timing to blocking/parrying is crucial and you have to pick your fights wisely.

Fast forward to today and I felt like picking it up again, hopped in and checked the games settings because I upgraded my graphics card and were about to adjust them when I acciendently stumbled upon the UI/HUD settings. To immersive myself more into the game I decided to turn off all HUD elements and gave it a spin and oh boy the game experience was soooo much better!

No longer got I distracted by all the HUDs elements and also it was really refreshing to experience a game's world with out getting your hand hold.

Previously I played Ghost of Tsushima which reduces your HUD to a minimum and while traversing the map is complete without a HUD and I felt like it was a bold but great decision by it's devs.

So my conclusion to this post is that more game devs should design there games with a minimum of HUD elements or even without one.

1jzoxjx,reddit,Crisis Core/Valhalla Knights Like Games,"Final Fantasy 7: Crisis Core and Valhalla Knights both share a gameplay style that I really don't ever see anymore. They're both 3d maps where you go to a ""dungeon"" (yes, a ""field dungeon"" is still a type of dungeon) and encounters are visible on the map (so far this is consistent with most FF games) where you can dodge encounters, find chests, and do quests. An important aspect of what I am looking for is that the combat is NOT turn based, even if its real time turn based. 

I've been playing through Valhalla Knights recently and its really scratching an itch, but I'd love to see if anyone knows of any newer games that have the same gameplay style. The first Valhalla Knights has a decent amount of content to it (easily 40 hours of gameplay to complete, though it does get pretty repetitive and grindy), but there is almost NOTHING but combat. Also, its not exactly smooth. I find the movement gums up frequently, and there is a lot of ""walk in circles till you find the quest goal, teleport back to town, and then walk back a mile to do it 2 more times"". 

It's been a hot minute since I played Crisis Core, but I doubt I'll be able to really get back into it for a while, since It'll be a while before I drop 50 bucks on a single player game in this economy for the remake, and the existence of the remake will make it harder to touch the original for a bit.

To be honest, I don't even think that I want another of this type of game for a bit, but I want to know of them if they exist. it's a fun little niche. Valhalla Knights has evoked a lot of the same vibes that I feel from the indie games in the Fire Emblem niche, and I'd love to see a new one come out, but since its the same studio as story of seasons, I have no idea if they'll ever touch the IP again, or if the people that worked on it are even still around.

Maybe something like comics using photo mode or something, which could be cool.

Hell, to go even further, imagine using a motion-tracking camera to record your own animations and emotes (give the Kinect something to do for Xbox and PC players...). Instead of having animation skills, you just record yourself with a Kinect or whatever-Sony-has.

I'd love to play Cyberpunk, the Mass Effect remake, Oblivion remake, Kingdom Come (1 and 2, not sure if I need to play 1 first) and Baldur's Gate 3 but they all seem like massive time sinks that I don't necessarily have. Open to all suggestions.

1k59jcp,reddit,"Looking for games with smooth, challenging, immersive combat","This is random but I’m just curious if there’s anything out there I’ve missed out on. My favorite combat system by far is God of War, and I’ve yet to find a game that gets even close to the level of creativity and expressiveness you can have with combat in those games. I love souls games and just beat Elden Ring but compared to GoW the dodging system and animations just feel clunky. It feels like I’m playing a video game. I love souls for the challenge aspect but for me it’s not remotely as fun and expressive as GoW. I played ER as a mage trying to mix it up a bit from souls and that was probably a mistake as I ended up just spamming the same spell 90% of the time, but still. I’ve never played Sekiro and everyone raves about the combat so I’ll try it, but I’ve never been blown away by Fromsoft combat. Playing Bloodborne after GoW for example felt like I was playing something from the early 2000s, and it’s only 3 years older than GoW. 

Anyway bring on the downvotes, but other combat systems I’ve enjoyed are Horizon Zero Dawn, Zelda BoW, and if I recall I actually liked the soulslike combat in Code Vein more than actual souls games, but it’s been a minute. I just got the new Horizon game, and the Elden Ring DLC, but I’m curious if anyone has any other recommendations.

Options are Enshrouded, Helldivers 2, Risk of Rain 2.

We are looking for a fun new adventure game for 2 players coop. No real preference between 3rd/1st, shooter/survivor/RPG  
We like games with a feeling of progression and teamwork. I like goals to complete. We like the progression survival games offer, but are wary of the monotony.

Risk of rain 2 Pros:

looks good because of gameplay, teamwork, definite direction/goal, sense of progression. cheap right now.

cons: minimal permanent progression, worried about monotony, bullet sponge bosses.

Helldivers 2 pros: gameplay looks very fun, upgrades and ship upgrades permanent. looks like so much fun on gameplay videos

cons: if its better with >2 people, may be difficult as my internet isnt great with handling larger online games. worried the lack of story may mean it feels a bit like cod? expensive.

cons: lack of clear main story, open world and survival aspect may make it seem grindy/slow/pointless, may get boring after a while if so. early access, worried about bugs. as a survival game, progression may be quite slow.

1k11agy,reddit,What were some promising games that didn't live up to your expectations? What did you wish was different about them?,"Saw an old ad for The Division, and recalled myself being so hyped for the world and gameplay. Looter shooters weren't my thing, but I did like Borderlands, so I wanted to give it a try.

Then it came out and I just didn't vibe with it at all. Only like 10 hours of trying to power through and hoping it gets better, but it just felt repetitive, enemies were too spongey, and the world felt so empty. I knew it was multi-player going into it, but I really felt like a refined single-player version of this game with solid characters would've had me hooked. Just my opinion, of course, I know there's a lot of fans for the Division, and D2 really improved things for a lot of people.

1k0t831,reddit,Have you ever found a translation or subtitle that spoiled an important plot point?,"So, i was watching the trailer for Cronos: The New Dawn and I put the spanish subtitles because had problems with what the guy said at the end (english is second language).

At the end of the trailer, the translation subtitle used specifically the word ""Viajera"" when translating the word ""traveler"" -as in a ""female traveler""- in english traveler is gender neutral but in spanish you can refer to a female traveler as ""viajera"" and a male one ""viajero"".
I googled very little so I'm not sure of this is true but it doesnt seem to be known at this point the gender of the main character, which can be completely irrelevant to the actual game (its also possible that a translator or AI translation used the word just because); but it got me thinking, what if its not irrelevant? what if, for some reason or other, its something to surprise the player akin to samus aran reveal. 
In reality I think its unlikely that its really important but I find very funny that a translation or subtitle could ruin an important plot point and was trying to think of a case that something similar happened.

For me, it's probably the Sims 1 OST. 

I used to play Sims 1 around the time it was brand new (I don't think I was old enough to have started school yet when I started playing) and I remember liking the songs back then. Seeing the expectations and patterns that a lot of kids prefer now compared to back then, I find it difficult to believe anyone born after 2008 would appreciate anything Sims-related pre-3. Idk, I haven't looked into demographics so it's all just a wild guess. By that logic though, I could just list every game I've played that was released before 2002. Aside from nostalgia, Sims 1 music has a charm that's definitely been ramping up to eventually release games with amazing OST like Urbz: Sims in the City (released shortly after Sims 2). I haven't played all of the games, but I was absolutely disappointed with Sims 4.

I don't disagree, but thinking about it, I feel like in general game boxes aren't what they used to be.

The PS5 boxes, while probably the least egregious of the current gen systems, I feel aren't quite as good as the PS4's. I think the bright white color scheme just clashes with boxart more often than the blue color scheme of the PS4 did. And the current XBOX banner isn't much better than the Switch 2's. Do you suppose this is just a product of the more minimalist logos companies are using that they have to use more garish colors to set themselves apart, or is it a different trend altogether?

Short: My pc was off for 1 week and I really want to switch from multiplayer to singleplayergames. Which games are u recommend and do you guys feel similar?

For those who want to read: I am 19 years old and I’m from Germany. I played pvp games all the time. Everything what I thought about was ranked. But I never came far with the ranks. My dream to get an esportler was so big, that I never gave up and I played hours upon hours for nothing. But I realised, that this shit isn’t for me . I don’t want to sit in front of my pc until 3am and i don’t want to play everyday so that I lose my interests in other things in life. Competitive games are completely manipulative, ngl. But not for me. I want to start playing games, that are worth it. No Micro-Microtransactions, no ranked grind. I want to explore, fight, loot, build and most-I want to have fun after all these years. I want to experience singleplayer Games. And I want to be able to pause the game because I want to take a break mid game maybe and i also have a girlfriend :D so there is not time and sense to grind ranked 

Which games are u recommend? 
Are u also switched to singleplayer? 
And what do you think about multiplayer va singleplayer in General?

1k20rav,reddit,Why isn't there more focus on pure simulation this generation?,"For all the leaps and bounds we've had in processing power over the last 2 - 3 generations of consoles, I feel like devs haven't focussed enough on the things that would really push gaming to the next level. There was a time that games were blowing our minds constantly for doing something new and unique. Metal Gear has always made huge leaps forward with every entry. Red Faction and Battlefiled gave us amazing destruction. Half Life 2 is still impressive a little over 20 years later. We all have that series that we wish was still going or at the very least influenced other devs to iterate on a great gameplay mechanic. So my point is, why aren't there more narrative driven open world immersive sims? Like Freeguy which is basically GTA online but with a persistent destructable map with a realtime day night cycle? It wouldn't even have to be present day. You could go past, present or future here. You could do so much with a small town full of unique characters all with thier own lives and a friend/ enemy gossip system. Like Fargo or Breaking Bad as an immersive sim would be NUTS. I just want convincing AI, physics and destruction/ rebuilding with a great story tying it all together. What do you guys think?

1jtbddv,reddit,Somewhat Chill game(s) with decent story and engaging gameplay. (Console),"I'm going to be ""out of commission"" for a short time, and need something that's not too tense to play. I'm not asking for no combat, but maybe something with relatively easy or not very strenuous.  Like this would be a good time to play Warzone, but that or any multiplayer games like that would be a bit too much with needing the quick reactions.

I want something fun and engaging to play, preferably with an interesting story. I don't want a game like Minecraft, Stardew Valley, Unpacking, or Telltale games. Games that I would consider somewhat ""chill"" and not too tense would be games like GTA, Call of Duty and Halo single players. And although I only brought up shooters, it doesn't have to be shooters. Like I'll play some Balatro during this time for sure.

I would also prefer not a super long game, but also not super short. One game I could see being suggested that unfortunately wouldn't be good suggestion (for me), is Skyrim. Skyrim like games just have not really captured me. I've tried a few times and it's just never hooked me. I don't think those type of games are bad, They just have never been able to keep my interest.

I'll be needing to lay on a couch, so I would need this to be for consoles and since I would most likely need to buy it digitally, if I don't already own it or it's on Game Pass, it'd be preferable that it's on newer consoles.

It seems to me that *most* games with multiple endings don’t necessarily make it easy to find the good ending on first go and I’m sure that’s partly a deliberate choice to keep players coming back. In any case, I was interested to hear of favourite examples of games that give you a reasonable chance of getting the “good” ending on first try?

A few caveats for the sake of discussion: 

* Obviously just talking about games that are sufficiently complex and don’t come down to a final singular decision to decide the ending.

* Also, excluding “perfect” or “better than good” endings or anything that’s generally deliberately hard to get, requires some fore-knowledge of the story or are literally locked on first play-through.

So which games do you think are good examples of this? Conversely, what are the most egregious examples of games where you can’t do this?

I’ve tagged the thread as spoilers of course because I imagine there will be some discussion of specific plot points in said games.

So which is more important? If it's story, then many many AA and indies games should be scoring at the same level as AAA titles. If it's gameplay, then many AAA titles should be scored much harsher.

Just, I find it strange that indie and smaller titles can at times get praise for their story, but still get a low score because the gameplay is the weakest part; While big budget titles can have weak gameplay yet still score nearly 9's and 10s simply because the story is great.

1k4q0av,reddit,"What are some games that would be better WITHOUT experience and level systems? (excluding Battle passes, account levels, and other player retention BS)","RPG style level-up systems often get alot of praise for being a really easy way to add a sense of progression to a game but I think there's plenty of times where they actively hinder the experience, and it be better without them.

Again, this is **NOT** referring to Battle passes, or account levels that just artificially board you from content so you're forced to grind.  This stuff is done for ""player retention"" metrics so they're tacked on because of corporate reasoning.  I want to hear games where the devs put in levels so you can unlock new skills or raise your stats, but it would've been better if those levels weren't there at all.

For example, in Street Fighter 6's world tour mode, your created character having a level actually makes it harder to gather dyes from random enemies, since they often require you hitting them with certain attacks, and they can easily DIE before you reach the goal needed to get the item you need.  

Another example is Sonic and the Secret Rings which has an EXP and Level system where you can equip more abilities as you complete levels.  However, every ability is either useless, should be standard, or in some rare cases, actually hinder your ability to control Sonic (primarily with homing attack lock-on range during enemy hunt missions, and whatever's making me overshoot rails when I try to jump off them).

1jyntup,reddit,"The struggle is real: modern gaming woes, what's been your biggest issue lately?","Hey fellow gamers, I wanted to start a discussion about the real struggles we all face in modern gaming. Whether it's technical issues, microtransactions, or just trying to find time to game in our busy lives, it seems like we all deal with something. Here are a few things I’ve been dealing with lately:

1.Endless Updates: You finally get some time to play, but then your game needs a huge update that takes hours to download. You’re just sitting there waiting while everyone else is playing. Not fun.

e.g. Call of Duty (any recent title)

Every time a new update drops, it feels like you're downloading an entire new game. You boot up for a quick match, and boom 120GB update. Game night = postponed.

2.Microtransactions and Pay2Win Mechanics: I don’t mind buying cosmetics, but when a game’s progression feels locked behind paywalls, it gets frustrating. Especially when it impacts the gameplay experience.

e.g. NBA 2K series

This franchise is notorious for pushing microtransactions in MyCareer mode. If you don’t spend money on VC, your player feels useless online for a long time. And it’s not a quick grind.

3.Servers and Connectivity: Getting dropped from a multiplayer match because of server issues, especially right before you’re about to win, is just the worst. It's like the universe conspires against your victories.

e.g. Battlefield 2042 (launch period)

At launch, the server issues were so bad that players were being disconnected constantly. And even when you got in, bugs were everywhere. It’s gotten better, but that launch period was brutal.

4.Toxic Communities: Some online communities just aren't fun anymore. There's nothing like the stress of getting yelled at for ""being bad"" in a casual game, or dealing with trolls in every match.

e.g. League of Legends

Even people who love the game admit it can be incredibly toxic, especially for newer players. The learning curve+pressure+trash talk=not always a good time.

5. Game Lengths: I don’t know about you, but sometimes I just want a good game that I can finish in a few hours without feeling like I’m being dragged through hours of filler content.

e.g. Assassin’s Creed Valhalla

Great game, beautiful world but there’s so much to do. Side quests, collectibles, upgrades, minigames… it can start feeling like a second job rather than fun.

Above mention problems I could think of 1 game that is good. Hades, no microtransactions. Tight gameplay. Polished and complete at launch. You can finish it in a reasonable amount of time, and it respects your time while being super replayable.

So what about you? What’s your biggest issue with modern gaming? Or do you have any clever solutions to combat these frustrations? Let’s talk about it.

I had all nintendo consoles until the N64 and then I was shifting to playstations always and mostly PC gaming. then I bought a SWITCH, i dunno why i skipped the rest, i think it was mostly due to the games i spend most time on the other systems and of course private life when growing up, but the SWITCH somehow was itching in my fingers and i felt some nostalgia and it was like having a 2nd birthday gift made for myself :) was such a great day having bought it with mario odyssey and zelda! felt so nostalgic and was never disappointed. i always wanted to play Metroid Prime (and of course more games like the zelda ones etc.) and was so happy to have gotten METROID PRIME last year, this moment was again very nostalgic for me, i even played it in my holidays and was sucked in and enjoyed nearly every minute! then i expected that NINTENDO would release the 2nd and 3rd before Metroid Prime 4..... 

I know I could get a Gamecube etc. but I really dunno why there is still at least no MP2 by now and i will wait to play MP4 until having played the other 2 games. also disappointed that Mario Galaxy 2 was still not released :(.

1jp6dyq,reddit,What's the best games adaptation of an anime?,"I was thinking today about how anime games usually skim over a lot of the story because they're made for people who have already seen every episode. Sparking Zero is great example, as it even removed an entire arc of the Super anime.

It makes sense that a potentially 100+ hour story would need to be trimmed, but it's unfortunate how often the result is a bastardized, truncated mimicry of the original writing.

So, I pose a question to r/gaming: what is the best anime adaptation of an *anime.* Specifically in regards to the story. Lots of anime spin off games capture the experience of the setting, mostly in regards to combat, so the question is specifically not asking what the most fun adaptation game is. 

As a bonus question, what spin off game has the best original story? It's not uncommon for anime spin off games to just come up with a whole new story, though the writing usually isn't very good. What games prove that wrong?",2025-04-01 20:46:07,gaming,gaming,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,0,15,,0.27,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1jp6dyq/whats_the_best_games_adaptation_of_an_anime/,Hormo_The_Halfling

I've noticed that some games (GRID, Control) are now available on Mac, but only through the App store. I already own Control on Steam and I'm not going to buy it again, so I'm stuck. Apple is so far behind with gaming, why would they limit adoption? I understand profit motivation, but if it didn't work for Epic to push gamers to an alternate store, it won't work for Apple. I would think they'll make more money by working to make games work well for Mac and more universally available so they sell more hardware.

- favorite game is Breath of the Wild
- not much into online play at the moment, but that might change over the years
- enjoys handheld option (though not a requirement)
- unsure what console(s) friends play on, so disregard for now

What direction would you all lean at the moment? What are some of the most popular exclusives amongst teens? Which platform has the most robust library? Any large impacts occurring due to tariffs already (in addition to the NS2)?

1jr9dyk,reddit,"I keep seeing people raving about the Switch 2's 120hz 1080p screen, but are we really expecting many games to make use of that?","I'm sure the new chipset will be a good upgrade on the existing one from the switch... but the expectation that we're going to get many games (especially from third party studios) actually running at 1080p/120fps is wild to me. Its still a mobile SOC, so its not going to be a power house.

I guess framegen and DLSS might help get us there, but if the headroom is there to run a game at 120fps, I'd rather limit it to 60 and save the battery life. I'd have been much more excited by an OLED screen running at 60fps.

For comparisons sake, I have a Legion Go that is technically capable of 1440p/144hz. Now this thing is a bit of a powerhouse in terms of handhelds, but I still play most games capped at 60fps and 800p.

1jr8mb7,reddit,"If intrusive kernel-level anti cheat is not the way, what are the best methods for game developers to mitigate cheating?","To preface this, I'm going to make a confession: I used to cheat in games back then but the one that I'm about to talk about was in CS:GO (yes this was years ago, game was still Global Offensive, not CS2)

During that time in CSGO i could literally just cheat and the only thing I'd have to worry about is to not be blatant on the spectators so that they would not vote kick me, but VAC itself literally does nothing on my ass as it could only watch in horror as I hack ingame. The cheat I used in question was also free, and I don't spend money on such things. If I were to attempt the same thing in let's say, Valorant or Fortnite, I would get BANNED in an instant.

Now that with COD Warzone and Verdansk 2025 is out, and people are STILL CHEATING like haywire, I'm wondering if they should just go ham and do what Riot did with Vanguard, or if they should find other ways of cleaning the game up.

I believe (now on the fence about this) that it's still super effective against cheaters at the cost of privacy as well as excluding players such as on Linux (especially Steam Deck) and GeForce NOW (I'm the latter) due to it's intrusive nature.

I don't cheat anymore, that shit was a dark era of the pandemic days in my past, but with Warzone and the cheating epidemic I've been thinking of this a lot.",2025-04-04 10:26:29,gaming,gaming,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,0,37,,0.35,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1jr8mb7/if_intrusive_kernellevel_anti_cheat_is_not_the/,karuraR

So let's have an exercise: a major company decided to develop a new game for the SNES. But using the budget for an AAA game.

  
It needs to run on a SNES, so it must obey the software limitations. Maybe, for this exercise, we can consider a customized cartridge for bigger memory space for assets.

1jyawe9,reddit,Open-World vs. Non-Linear,"Hi all!

Yesterday I hopped into a discussion on the direction of open-world games in the industry. What I see a lot of in the comments of that discussion are people using open-world and non-linear interchangeably. To me, these are not the same. However, it definitely depends on one’s definition of those two concepts.

As an example, I argued that Majora’s Mask is open-world, but someone else disagreed with it being considered a true open-world game.

Then there’s the linearity. Is an open-world game non-linear by definition? To me, it isn’t. An example is Marvel’s Spider-Man. Undeniably open-world, but very much a linear game, the way I see it.

Furthermore, is a non-linear game open-world by definition? I also say no to this. A game like The Walking Dead is non-linear to me. However, it’s certainly not open-world.

What are your definitions? How do you view these two genres as they relate to each other?

EDIT: Super cool to see the different perspectives. Something that’s abundantly clear so far is that my definition of linearity is a bit narrow. I like the idea of narrative linearity and level linearity. Something like The Walking Dead is (of course) linear in terms of level structure; you can’t choose when you want to progress the narrative. However, it’s non-linear in a narrative sense. On a separate note, to those of you trying to argue that open worlds have to be “large maps,” good luck to you. It seems there are lots of others that agree with you, but I certainly don’t.",2025-04-13 15:58:00,gaming,gaming,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,0,65,,0.41,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1jyawe9/openworld_vs_nonlinear/,Bee892

But coming back to replay Bioshock 2 recently, I couldn't help but reassess my views. The game felt generally forced and contrived, almost like a caricature at times of the first, an obligatory sequel that somewhat tarnishes the legacy of a classic.

Here are some tips to be ready for online retail war!,"If you're planning to brave the Nintendo Switch 2 launch (despite the overpriced games), here are some tips to have the best chances of competing with the scalpers and other enthusiastic gamers like yourself!

1. Make sure you have yourself signed into all major retailers (Target, Walmart, Best Buy, Amazon, etc) on as many devices as safely possible. Utilize passkeys & biometrics where ever possible to minimize the amount of time it takes you to sign in.

2. Make sure you have your preferred payment method set up as **default** on those sites. 

3. Avoid payment methods, such as PayPal, that require you to be bounced back and forth between sites.  Remember, middle-man financial services like PayPal will be hammered as well.

4. Walmart tip: The site allows you to link a bank account for payments. If you're comfortable with that, it cuts out the need to connect to a credit card company to access your funds.

5. Obviously, get yourself signed into *all* the retail sites you want to try on all devices. It might be worth it to have WiFi turned off on at least one of your mobile devices because many sites handle network traffic from cellular differently than over normal TCP/IP. Those channels might be a bit less bogged down.

1joanc0,reddit,"For competitive fps gaming, does physical distance from your screen matter at all or just field of view?","What i'm asking is, is there an advantage to being on a small screen and sitting very close over a large tv farther away?


Trying decide whether to get the 83"" S85D ($1800 at av dudes) or the higher quality 77"" S90D ($2200 most places). S90D is a QD-Oled that is brighter (room does get a bit bright for my 11 year old 300 nit LG a few hours out of the day), has better colors, and 144Hz instead of 120Hz. I think if i get the 77"", i will be slightly too far away on my couch and will end up switching input to a smaller, older screen i will have next to it for when i need a desk for rts type games. I think the 83"" will be big enough not to feel the need to do this unless there is some type of inherent advantage of being closer regardless of field of view. Obviously, I will feel it if it exists. I'm going to be doing just ps5 for everything but Age of Empires (which i will play on the smaller screen with the desk) until there is a graphics card that can do 4k60 with raytracing for a price that doesn't want to make me puke. My gtx 970 is good enough for age of empires, and i don't feel anything short of 4k60 with raytracing will be a big enough upgrade over ps5 to be worth the upgrade. Is the 144Hz worthwhile over 120Hz for pc gaming? I have heard you should have at least 60 base frames to get a good experience with frame gen. Nothing is going to run at exactly 60, so 65 or 70 would result in going above the refresh rate if it is 120. Will this cause tearing or does that only happen when the fps is below the refresh rate of a screen that does not have VRR?

1k6mcmz,reddit,Hi all. I know gaming is very subjective but I'm hoping for some input between choosing a game tomorrow. The choice is between Clair Obscura and Oblivion Remastered. For context please see below.,"So, the last great game I played was Black Myth Wukong.  I prefer third person action adventure games. So Clair is up my alley. I also enjoy immersive story telling RPG games, so Oblivion is right up my alley. But it's my dislikes that might shape this choice. I don't like first person games. Any genre. I had meningitis when I was a teen so I suffer from motion sickness. First person makes me feel queasy. So, is the third person on Oblivion any good actually? On the other hand, I don't like turn based action. To be fair, I haven't really given any turn based mechanic games a shot and Clair Obscura looks intriguing enough to get me to overlook this aspect.

I have an itch for something RPG and medieval and fell on KCD2 (never played the first) vs the Oblivion Remaster (I lived for this game when I was younger).

I have about 4-5h of game time per week meaning I can't afford two virtual lives and must choose.

Which one do you guys prefer and why? All opinions are welcomed, just please tell me why you prefer one over the other.

EDIT: I decided to go for KCD2. My conclusion is that I already played Oblivion and want a new experience. Most importantly, Oblivion fans mention it's a great game while KCD2 fans talk like they've found Jesus.

1k5wgnq,reddit,Skyrim veteran here—thinking of diving into Oblivion. Is it worth it and how does it really compare?,"Hey everyone! I’m a big fan of the Elder Scrolls series and I’ve sunk way too many hours into Skyrim over the years. I’ve been hearing great things about Oblivion - REMASTERED -, but I’m on the fence about whether it’s actually “better” or just different.

A few things I’m curious about:

1. World & Exploration – How does Cyrodiil’s map and atmosphere compare to Skyrim’s? Does it feel as alive?


2. Story & Quests – I loved Skyrim’s civil war storyline and the Dragonborn main quest. How’s Oblivion’s main plot and guild content?


3. Character Progression – I heard Oblivion’s leveling system is more skill-based and less “grindy.” Is that true, and does it make leveling more meaningful?


4. Combat & Gameplay – Skyrim’s combat feels smooth and cinematic. Does Oblivion’s combat hold up, or will I feel like I’m fighting with buttered noodles?


5. Mods PS5 & Quality-of-Life – Are there must-have mods that bring Oblivion up to modern standards (graphics, UI, etc.) for the PS5?



I really want to know: is Oblivion actually better, or just a classic that aged differently? Any pros/cons or personal experiences you can share would be super helpful. Thanks in advance—don’t hold back!

1juiifl,reddit,The volatility of one's online game account is saddening.,"Ubisoft, Microsoft accounts hacked and their support was extremely unhelpful, and flatout denied to do anything despite me collecting evidence all the way back from 2019.   
  
I had my Ubisoft, Microsoft, EA and Epic hacked in Feb while I was asleep and my PC was off. Woke up next morning, noticed my google account hacked and fixed it. Noticed that my Epic and EA were hacked right away (the Ubi and MS emails must've gone to Spam), and I got my account back in 30 minutes (despite the hacker having changed out the login e-mail ID).

I noticed my Ubi and MS account being gone in March. Oh-shit moment followed by a quick trip to their respective supports and opening a case. 10 days later, I had responses from both of them - Ubisoft somehow managed to verify my account, and then proceeded to NOT be able to verify my account and then decline the account recovery process. Microsoft also declined the recovery for similar bullshit reasons, both stating ""account security"", yada yada yada and whatnot.

  
I have purchased a couple of games in both the accounts, from my memory I've spent 60$ on each account totally in the games and DLC for them. I had a few thousand hours totally in each account playing Rainbow Six Siege, Crew 2, Breakpoint and on the MS side a ton of hours in Forza Horizon 4, some in minecraft and a few in Horizon 5. I have no CDs purchased to provide keys for (since I bought my PC in 2019 when CDs were more or less extinct). 2FA was enabled by email for all my accounts except the EA account. Launching Rainbow Six from my linked Steam account opens a login page for the Ubisoft launcher and doesn't log in to the account or launch the game.

  
Now, thankfully my Steam was untouched (which is where most of my games reside, and hooray for Steam Guard) but it still pains me to lose all these hours and games. What pains me more is the callousness of the support - they state vague reasons, refuse to explain everything and most of the times spew what looks like automated AI responses, which is HUGELY discouraging as a customer that has spent money on them (and can potentially spend money again on them if the support is good). 

It once again reinforces the idea that we don't own anything, anybody can take anything from you and support can take the hacker's side and be unhelpful - resulting in one losing things in the blink of an eye. Makes me less hopeful for the future of gaming, as things get more digital.

1jtlvt5,reddit,Rick Rubin: A Spiritual Guru or a Master Marketer?,"Rick Rubin is often hailed as a kind of mystical creative force, a barefoot oracle of minimalism and intuition, whose hands-off approach to music production is somehow seen as revolutionary. There’s no doubt he’s been involved in some powerful work, and he clearly holds a deep reverence for the creative process. But the more I look at the full picture, the more contradictions I see.

Rubin has a net worth of over $200 million. Yet, his podcast has sponsors. His online community “The Creative Act” is behind a paywall. He still charges enormous fees for production work, which, by his own account  is extremely hands-off. He often dodges questions about the business side of his work by saying things like “let’s talk about the art instead,” or “someone else can handle that.” This might sound poetic at best but at worst it’s evasive or even manipulative.

If Rubin really cared about spreading his creative philosophy, wouldn’t he make it accessible to everyone? Why not remove the paywalls, make the podcast ad-free, mentor emerging artists at affordable rates? With the financial security he has, it seems totally within reach. But instead, his wisdom, however sincere, is repackaged and monetised ruthlessly.

Take the Johnny Cash cover of Hurt. Yeah, Rubin suggested the song. It was a brilliant choice, but also a strategic one. It reintroduced Cash to Gen X and millennial audiences by tapping into a pre-existing emotional current. And while the result was haunting and powerful, it’s hard not to see the marketing logic beneath the poetry. The move wasn’t just emotionally resonant, it was commercially savvy.

Compare that to someone like Steve Albini, who was transparent about finances, kept his rates fair, refused royalties, and worked with both big names and underground artists alike. Albini never cultivated a guru persona, and yet, he arguably embodied more artistic integrity because he owned the economics of his work instead of pretending they didn’t exist.

In the end, I think sincerity and strategy can coexist, but only when there’s transparency. When creators are honest about their dual intentions (to move people and to reach them), we trust them more. When they mystify or obscure their strategy under a cloak of detachment, it starts to feel hollow, even manipulative.

So: Is Rick Rubin a wise man who made money by accident? Or is he a master of branding whose detachment is part of a very strategic performance?

Just to clarify, I don’t deny that Rubin has clear talent and wisdom, I just think he’s quite greedy with it

Basically, albums that seem to have been written to be a complete work. And then of those, which do you think are the best of the best?

Side note: they don’t have to be concept albums, but concept albums tend to fit those criteria. 

Some examples of what I’m talking about:

Bruce Springsteen - Born to Run

Deltron 3030 - Deltron 3030

Fleetwood Mac - Rumours

Miles Davis - Birth of the Cool

Hum - You’d Prefer an Astronaut

Pink Floyd - The Wall, Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here

1jxrtpl,reddit,What's a song quote that motivates you to go forward?,"This randomly crossed my mind, because just now while I was listening to music on shuffle, this song ""Sunflower"" by Rex Orange County started playing, which reminded me of this again:

""Sunflower still grows at night,
Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes""

A sunflower is known for following the sun during the day, and being at its peak when the sun is present. But the idea of it continuing to grow at night says that even in darkness or challenging times, we can still grow and be positive. 
""Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes"" is like a sense of longing and hope, and waiting for something positive to happen. That's my interpretation at least :)",2025-04-12 21:25:17,music,music,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,23,66,,0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1jxrtpl/whats_a_song_quote_that_motivates_you_to_go/,No_Interaction_7760

Some songs make my chest tighten. Certain frequencies make me flinch.
I’ve even had moments where a beautiful harmony made me feel like crying and hiding at the same time.

For years I thought this was a weakness.
Like I was just “too sensitive” or overreacting.
But what if it’s just a different sensory configuration?
A different kind of perception?

So I’m curious – does anyone else here experience music as something overwhelming?
Not just emotionally, but in your body too?

What part of music hits you the hardest – volume, rhythm, specific sounds?
Do you feel it more as a gift or a challenge?

I often will read while I'm listening to his instrumental tunes in the background and I truly feel like I understand him more as an artist now than ever before. I love his music so much and it was clear from his writing and musical creations he was unique, but it's been such a pleasure to get to experience more of the content that he put into his own mind that made him such an artistic genius.

To those who don’t know they were a pretty popular band in the 90s but their music was often overshadowed by the medias obsession with Dando’s good looks, his escapades with drugs and hanging out with famous people such as Oasis, Courtney Love and Johnny Depp. 

Seems like everyone is writing a memoir these days. I’ll definitely be checking this one out. Which other musicians from this era do you wish would write a memoir? I’d read Courtney Loves or Billy Corgans even though I’m not particularly a fan of either but I bet they have some wild stories.",2025-04-03 09:28:04,music,music,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,21,21,,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1jqdxrg/upcoming_memoir_rumours_of_my_demise_by_evan_dando/,Cultural-General6750

This asks another question of how cds are listened though, does one play the same album over and over, and drawing back to the question, if you get bored of that, was/is the only way to find new music to spend on another cd, what if you hated it? 

Would love to hear how people approach cd listening and how you did/do explore new music through physical media

1jvigzp,reddit,Rock bands that should be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,"The Smiths - The Smiths are one of the shortest lived yet most popular rock bands of the 1980s. Active for only five years, they are one of the most influential bands. The Smiths had previously been nominated twice in 2015 and 2016 but missed both nominations. The Smiths are one of the pioneers of 1980s alternative/indie rock. 

Motorhead - Motorhead is one of the most popular heavy metal bands of all time. The band had a career lasting exactly 40 years, disbanding just after the death of lead vocalist and bassist Lemmy Kilmister. Several other members had died in the 2010s both before and after Lemmy - co-lead guitarist Wurzel in July 2011, original drummer Phil Taylor in November 2015 (just one month before Lemmy) and original lead guitarist ""Fast"" Eddie Clarke in January 2018 (becoming the last member of the band's classic ""original"" lineup). Motorhead was nominated for induction in 2020 but missed it. 

Iron Maiden - Iron Maiden is one of the most popular heavy metal bands of all time. Iron Maiden is one of the most controversial snubs when it comes to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Iron Maiden missed both nominations, having previously been nominated in both 2021 and 2023. 

Ronnie James Dio - Ronnie James Dio is an icon of heavy metal. He has been the lead vocalist of several big bands including Rainbow, Black Sabbath, Dio (his own solo band) and Heaven & Hell (technically a Black Sabbath reunion). Ronnie James Dio was also not inducted as a member of Black Sabbath during their induction in 2006. Ronnie James Dio died in May 2010 and he would love the honor. 

Motley Crue - Motley Crue is possibly the biggest 1980s hair/glam metal band out there and they have never even been nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band even claims that it's unlikely that they will ever be inducted.

Any Albums by Bob Marley & The Wailers.
My parents were massive fans of his music before I was even born. When I was growing up, I heard his music consistently at home, events, weddings, parties, barbecues. His songs still make me feel peaceful when I hear it. Every album of his has no song that doesn't sound dated. It sounds like it could be released.

I like that 21st century artists like Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Alicia Keys, Lana Del Rey, etc are making albums that are about quality not just quantity. It will make listeners listen to it consistently after hearing for the first time.

1jomcxq,reddit,Why can't we all like different music without being told our taste is bad just because we don't like whatever else does.,"My family likes watching American Idol and I personally do not like it because I very much dislike 90% of the songs they choose. They're just not the kind of songs I want to hear being covered on this show but that's okay the show doesn't have to be for everybody. Now one person in my family in particular can't handle people's opinions that don't align with his own I've noticed and didn't like what I said. 

Saying I have no good taste in music unlike the rest of the family. I mean why do people feel the need to bash others because your taste doesn't align? Also why do some people feel like their opinions are superior to others it's a little ridiculous? I'm willing to agree to disagree and walk away I don't feel like my opinion is superior and then I have to defend it. There's just honestly no point.

 Also this man likes to tell you quite often to use your brains and acts like you're stupid as well as feeling like his opinions are superior and that he's always right you're wrong it's so aggravating. People need to learn that not everyone is going to agree with you all the time.

Anyway, I think the King Harvest version is better. Dave “Doc” Robinson had the perfect voice for that song. It has some soul in it. 

No offense to Toploader I think they did a good job just don’t like that weird 2000’s sound singers were doing like drawing out sounds thinking they were Christina Aguilera. The one part of this version I like though comes at about 1:52. This was what my brain was telling me was in the original.

1jpvjt3,reddit,Musicians Fight Back Against AI with Silent Album and Lawsuits,"The music world is rallying against the use of artificial intelligence in music production. In February 2025, over 1,000 artists, including Kate Bush, Damon Albarn, and Annie Lennox, united for a record protest. They recorded an instrumental album, ""Is This What We Want?,"" a sharp protest against suggested changes to UK copyright law that would allow AI firms greater latitude to use copyrighted music in their own work without consent from artists. Their contention is simple: if artists are being replaced by AI-generated music, music itself in the future may be vulnerable.



This is a figurative protest, but it represents mounting alarm among musicians, composers, and music industry experts about the integration of artificial intelligence into the creative process. They worry most that AI music, which can reproduce human songs by scanning massive collections of previous tunes, can devalue the creativity and artistry that give human music its uniqueness. With AI models now able to clone styles, voices, and even the passion of real-life artists, there are artists that fear having their work reproduced without the rightful recompense or credits. Meanwhile, big recording labels sue.



In June of 2024, Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group filed a case against AI music company Suno and Udio for employing copyright protected music to train their AI in the first instance. These lawsuits pose an even broader legal and ethical issue: should AI be taught using existing music without compensating original creators? Most in the business contend that without strong regulations, AI firms would be able to freely gain financially from artists' efforts while undermining the same business that motivated them. This fight extends beyond the music business—it raises basic questions regarding intellectual property, authorship of creation, and the role of AI in art. Some view AI as an unstoppable force that will define the future of music, creating new frontiers for composition and creativity. Others worry that if left to run amok, human artists will be unable to compete with AI-created material that can be created faster, cheaper, and on a jaw-dropping scale.



With artists, industry stakeholders, and lawmakers now disagreeing about the future of AI and music, the next several months could prove instrumental in shaping how copyright law adapts in the new world.



If AI music should be more tightly controlled, or is it just the next evolution of music? How do musicians get paid when AI are trained on their compositions? While protests continue to surface and lawsuits continue to unravel, one thing is clear—this battle is far from won. Where are we going? Should we throw open the doors to AI as a new creative force, or could it pose an actual threat to musicians and to the industry itself?

1jpuej8,reddit,Women and Children First is the best David Lee Roth era Van Halen album,"While most Van Halen can argue over what is the best David Lee Roth era Van Halen album, it's either Van Halen 1, Fair Warning or 1984, but I think it's 1980s Women and Children First.  It's the raw, unadulterated distillation of their unique energy, capturing the band at their most innovative and arguably, their most daring, showcasing a darker, grittier edge. This album took what made Van Halen 1 and 2 great and added Heavy Metal and Blues influences. This is also the album where Eddie truly began pushing the boundaries of his instrument, incorporating unconventional techniques and textures. Tracks like ""And The Cradle Will Rock..."", ""Everybody Wants Some!!"", ""Romeo Delight"", ""Loss Of Control"", ""Could This Be Magic?"" & ""In A Simple Rhyme"" ooze with a primal intensity, fueled by Roth's theatrical bravado and Eddie Van Halen's increasingly experimental guitar work. The album is less about polished pop and more about the band's ferocious stage presence, translated into a studio masterpiece. While other albums may have greater commercial appeal, Women and Children First captures the raw, unapologetic spirit that made Van Halen a force to be reckoned with, solidifying its place as the quintessential Roth-era release.",2025-04-02 17:28:28,music,music,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,12,17,,0.77,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1jpuej8/women_and_children_first_is_the_best_david_lee/,NewPatron-St

The 2007 Honda Accord ($2500 - 196000 miles)

You want a car that gets the job done, that’ll never leave you stranded, and that nobody will ever compliment you on? Well no look further, the 2007 Honda Accord.

Let’s talk features,
Aux Cord? Nope.
Bluetooth? Nope.
Fancy wheels? Nope.
Rear-view camera? Nope, but it has a transparent rear window and you have a neck that can fucking turn.

Let me tell you a story about this car. One day the service engine light came on, I didn’t give a shit and ignored it, it went away. I haven’t seen it since. The end. 

You can take the engine out of this car, drop it off the golden state bridge, fish it out of the water 1000 years later, put it in the trunk of the car, fill the gas tank with Nutella, turn the key and this puppy will start right the fuck up. 

This car will outlive you, it will outlive your children.

Interesting facts about this car:
     • In the owners manual, oil is listed as “optional” 
* The car’s name is Goldilocks and she REFUSES to be called anything else.
* This car will not take your shit.
* One time a Semi rear-ended my car. The Honda survived, the Semi didn’t. 

Wanna know more? Great, I have Goldilocks fill out a survey!

Relationship status: Divorced
Children: 3
Favorite song: “I wanna dance with somebody” by Whitney Houston
Favorite food: Grilled Chicken (she’s watching her figure)

This car is as practical as a Roth IRA, it is as middle of the road as your grandpa during his last silver alert, it’s as utilitarian as a member of a church whose scripture is based entirely on water bills. 

When I ran the CarFax on this car, I received a single piece of paper that said “it’s an Accord, it’s fine.”

Let’s face the facts, this car isn’t going to win any beauty contests but neither are you. Stop lying to yourself and stop lying to your wife. This isn’t the car you want, it’s the car you deserve. The 2007 Honda Accord.

1jzyr1y,reddit,[Homemade] Potato Terrine,"While it may be a little time consuming, it's still easy, so don't just be a spec-tater, this Potato Terrine is quite a-peeling! 🤣

Mix some heavy cream with salt, garlic powder, and grated parm then thinly slice (or use a mandolin) some potatoes and toss them in the mix.

Line a baking dish with parchment paper leaving enough over the edges to fold over the top and make a few layers of potato at the bottom. Drizzle with melted butter then repeat potato and butter until the pan is about half full. You can go higher if you want to make them bigger. Fold the parchment paper over the top, cover w/ tin foil and bake at tree fiddy until they're soft and tender.

Remove and let cool for about 15 minutes then use something heavy to press down on the top, a 5lb bag of flour worked perfect for me 😂 and chill in the fridge overnight.

The next day, slice and brown the cut sides in olive oil and you're H-O-T-P-O-T-A-T-O or whatever Chappelle Roan yells about...if you're serving as a side, trim the ends off and top with a scallion, I had these with some 420 garlic butter 😆

Instead of ¼ cup of cream, I went with ½ cup of cream and ¼ cup of milk. Although, after taking the frosting out of the fridge, it needed to thin out with more milk.

1jpr8ky,reddit,Korean chicken [homemade] homecook,"Korean fried chicken
A simple but delicious recipe 😋. I missed Soju bar so I had to make it at home 😊.

Ingredients:
Marinate
- Ginger
- Salt and pepper
- Oil
- Mirin (optional)
- Potato starch

Sauce
- I used 1 tbsp. Gochujang depends on how spicy you want it to be. 
- I used 0,5 tbsp. Honey depends on how sweet you want it to be. 
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 1,5 tbsp soy sauce
- 2 to 4 garlic cloves

Garnish (Whatever you have left in the fridge
- Green onions
- Cilantro

Instructions
Marinate your chicken wings or drumsticks 2 hours before with ginger, salt, pepper and oil. (Mirin is optional)

After marinating, coat them with starch (potato or corn works fine).
Shake off the excess starch and fry them 2 times. Once for 3 to 5 min. The second time for 3 min.

Coat it in the sauce and toss it around in a bowl. Top it off with your garnish and there you have it! Your own korean fried chicken 🍗",2025-04-02 15:21:12,food,food,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,81,1,,0.98,https://i.redd.it/mkf2mb5mvfse1.jpeg,ViyVY

I made homemade whipped cream and tempered some chocolate bars.   The final product was picture perfect.  Craving was more than satisfied.  ",2025-04-15 16:33:52,food,food,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,71,11,,0.77,https://i.redd.it/fxi6e6re01ve1.jpeg,Lilicion

1jyi6lp,reddit,[Homemade] Beef Carpaccio roastbeef sandwiches,"(For 2 sandwiches)

Get your desired sandwich bread (I personally used Mediterranean bread that already has tea especially of salt and olive oil)

-butter it with the amount you like

-thinly slice half a tomato and add it to the bottom part of the sandwich (save the other half for later)

-thinly slice half of your desired fresh mozzarella cheese into thin slices (save the other half for later)

-spread some balsamic vinegar on the mozzarella

-add the carpaccio, 2-3 slices per sandwich and add a dash of lemon oil

-thinly slice half a avocado and add the slices on to of the carpaccio (save the other half for later) and light season the avocado with salt and lemon pepper

Close the sandwich

I usually use a panini maker when toasting them, but people have their own preferences

Once it's been toasted to your personal preferences the carpaccio will have turned into a lovely roastbeef inside the sandwich

Finally, use the leftover tomato, mozzarella and avocado to make a little side salad, either to go with the sandwiches or to eat later, if eating them later, add balsamic vinegar and lemon oil",2025-04-13 21:11:48,food,food,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,43,0,,0.91,https://i.redd.it/dvivt1z64oue1.jpeg,Kevin_Eats_Sushi

1jmp1tg,reddit,Iceland and Norway Itinerary,"Hello everyone,

I'm planning a self-guided trip to Iceland and Norway from late September to early October this year. After doing my own research, I organize my itinerary (rough draft, thought of build up the structure first then go further).

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/12p3V1QpF_APsg0fhA0DkwIHDFy9bRGn1e0-XUJzB4Zg/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12p3V1QpF_APsg0fhA0DkwIHDFy9bRGn1e0-XUJzB4Zg/edit?usp=sharing)

Since my time is limited, I want to focus on breathtaking natural landscapes and unique Arctic Circle experiences. Of course, I absolutely must see the Northern Lights in the Arctic region. Do you have any tips or tricks for maximizing my chances? 

Feel free to comment in the document above. I’d love to hear your suggestions or advice regarding my travel plans! 

I also have a few specific questions that I hope you can help me with:

Iceland's Ring Road self-drive itinerary: ChatGPT suggested skipping the Westfjords and Snæfellsnes Peninsula. Is it really impossible to cover these areas within my timeframe? Also, I’ve heard that apart from Reykjavík, other areas in Iceland are not very developed for tourism, with sparse populations. Would this pose any inconvenience for travelers?

Norway in a Nutshell tickets: I read that buying individual tickets for each segment is much cheaper than purchasing the official tour package. However, some people say that if you book each segment separately and one leg is delayed or disrupted (e.g., due to a strike), it could affect the entire journey. On the other hand, the official package provides assistance in case of disruptions. What’s the best approach here?

Transportation from Bergen to Lofoten: I couldn’t find any direct flights from Bergen to Lofoten. It seems that I have to fly to Bodø first and then take a ferry. How can I check the ferry schedule? I only found various cruise package tours but not standard ferry routes.

Activities in Tromsø: Apart from Northern Lights chasing, what other Arctic experiences would you recommend? (e.g., ice fishing, reindeer experiences, etc.) Are there any recommended tour operators for such activities (like Klook or KKday)?

Additionally, if you have any local recommendations for restaurants and accommodations, please share them with me. I’d really appreciate your help—thank you so much!",2025-03-29 15:41:14,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,3,24,,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jmp1tg/iceland_and_norway_itinerary/,tiatsao0727

With the Android app, as soon as the app homepage loads, if you try to click anything, it tells you ""An unexpected error occurred"".

1jmgk5r,reddit,Which should I choose? Bali-Manila or Bali-Singapore-Hanoi,"**Hi guys! Can you help me decide + share your cost/experience for my planned trips?**

My planned trips:

July 25-July 30 - Bali with family

July 30 - They'll be going home to Manila

I was supposed to go straight to Hanoi with my sister to meet with friends but her friend cancelled so she's going to Manila with my family. My friend already booked her ticket so I'm still going to Hanoi. The problem is, she'll be arriving on August 2. Thus:

My two options:

1. I'm going home to Manila to rest and repack, then I will fly to Hanoi on August 1
2. I will fly from Bali to Hanoi, through Scoot. So other than it being the cheapest flight + there's a Singapore layover too. (Singapore in July 30-31, Hanoi in July 31-August 1)

My situation:

\- I am not a solo traveller, and this will be my very first solo travel (Singapore-Hanoi for a few days). I am a bit wary but also, I know I can hold my own (23, female, I look like a victim, but I can hold my own in the countries mentioned, they're very safe).

\- I want to choose whichever is cheapest + worth it

\- If Option 1 is significantly cheaper (Bali-Manila-Hanoi) (by around USD 80-100), I'll choose Option 1

\- If Option 2 is significantly cheaper, or only slightly more expensive than Option 1, then I will choose this for the experience. Again, USD 80-100 is the cost difference I can tolerate

I attached the image of the cost comparison, based on the current price of flights right now (+ image attached).

I'm still not entirely sure of the realistic cost of the Speeing Pod, Food, and Activities in Singapore for a layover flight, and Acommodation and Food in Hanoi. I am researching it inmy spare time, but I also want to hear your suggestions!

**What I need help with:**

1. Can you share your experience/cost in either or both Singapore and Hanoi?
2. If you can weigh in on what is the better option based on experience in the same flight/destinations, I would love to hear your thoughts!
3. What was your experience solo travelling?

I am the type of traveler that most hate. I love photography, so I take photos a lot, it is the highlight of my trip for me because I can enjoy it after the trip pa hehe. I love wearing cute clothes, but I am willing to bring less/maneuver the luggage situation, so I only bring 7kg for Option 2. I want to stay longer in one place to appreciate it and explore every nook and cranny than going everywhere. I am less of a traveler and more of a vacationer, so I might not enjoy Singapore if I'm exhausted but it's Singapore, so I think I'll enjoy even if I stay in the airport and only leave for the city center for dinner.

Please be kind, even if you don't agree with my travelling style. I just wanted to hear the thoughts of veteran travellers/those who have done the same trip as the one I'm planning. Thank you.

If I missed any details, please ask. I will kindly provide more context, I just think my post is already too long.

Looking to take my girlfriend of three years on an international trip in late May, as she hadn’t been out of the country a ton. I travel a lot for work so unfortunately my windows of availability to leisure travel are the best.

I’ve been to Latina America, Asia and am very comfortable in foreign countries, but want to choose not too adventurous of a place to ease her into things. That said, two places I’m looking at are Mexico City and Antigua. Both are tourist friendly and have direct flights from LAX, which is a huge plus as well probably only have 4-5 nights. We are the type of people who can have a blast doing both city and nature things, so both are very appealing. 

Downside is that May is the beginning of rainy season and I’m wondering which of these is better, or if it wouldn’t be worth it.

1jlm9rm,reddit,August 10 day road trip through the Balkans- help me choose route!?,"
Hi y’all, I have 10 days in the Balkans, and my husband and I are renting a car. We love moving around, seeing different landscapes, and don’t mind a packed itinerary. I really want to experience the mountains and alpine scenery, but I also want to get down to the southern coast of Albania. My husband, on the other hand, is set on seeing some of Croatia.

We know that renting a car in Croatia and dropping it off in Albania can be tricky, but we’re open to working around it. Here are two rough route ideas—would love your thoughts on how to divide our time or if you have a better suggestion!

Route 1: Just Albania
	•	Tiranë
	•	Shkodër
	•	Theth (Albanian Alps)
	•	Albanian Riviera (Vlore or Himarë?)
	•	Maybe a ferry to Corfu
	•	Back to Tiranë to fly home

Route 2: Croatia to Albania
	•	Dubrovnik
	•	Kotor (Montenegro)
	•	Shkodër
-would LOVE to fit a teth ntl park in here if possible 
	•	Vlore
	•	Tiranë to fly home

I love the idea of seeing the transitions between different countries, but I’m struggling to balance beach vs. mountain time. How many days would you recommend in each place? And is one of these routes a clear winner?

Would love any advice or alternatives! Thanks!",2025-03-28 03:47:18,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,3,7,,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jlm9rm/august_10_day_road_trip_through_the_balkans_help/,Automatic_Intern_440

Please excuse grammatical errors or spelling mistakes; it's not my native language. c:

Here's some info about me so you can get a better image of what I might know or don't know.

I'm a m/20 from austria. German as a native language and English on a C1 level (I'm better at speaking than typing). I already had the privilege to visit many different countries with my family, resorts, and hotels, so mostly crowded beaches and cities. As an introvert, I feel much better discovering cozy rural towns, finding secret beaches, or experiencing beautiful natural scenery.

The countries outside of Europe I have visited so far are:

* Turkey | Antalya
* Egypt | Hurghada
* Maledives | Olhuveli Island
* Thailand | Phuket, Patong Beach

I always wanted to travel the world, and now after I graduated high school and served my mandatory military service, I'll finally be able to fulfill my dream of traveling Asia by car for roughly 5.5 months (24 weeks).

I will start from Austria and drive all the way to Turkey in the first couple of days without much of a stop. After Turkey, Georgia, and finally Azerbaijan, I'm going to take a ferry at Baku over the Caspian Sea to whatever port in Kazakhstan. My research got me to the point that there are regularly ferries that transfer from the Caspian Sea to ports in Kazakhstan. The tickets for the ferry can be bought locally at the port, to my knowledge. After I arrive in Kazakhstan, I'll finally start with the main part of my journey. The car I use for traveling is an old VW bus and is already edited for traveling. There's a bed in it as well as a little kitchen and an external shower. Electricity is also being produced by solar panels on top of the car. I am just going to travel from town to town and decide on the go what I would like to see today. The entire way from Austria to Baku, Azerbaijan, is not supposed to be any longer than 1 week. In Kazakhstan I will roughly spend 2 weeks.

The next country would be Kyrgyzstan, which was one of the reasons I wanted to do this journey so badly. I have heard nothing but positive things about this country, its nature, its people, and its food. I'm maybe going to spend 2 weeks there.

Next stop, PR China. Sadly, it is not possible to drive in China with an Austrian (EU) driver's license without any additional burdens. Even with an international driver's license (which I possess), it is not possible to drive in China without the Tourist Driver's Allowance. It can be obtained by a multiple-choice test regarding Chinese traffic signs and an ophthalmologist's certificate. Since I will enter PR China in the middle of the desert, I wanted to ask how the hell I'm supposed to get to a doctor who can hand me such a certificate and where to do that test. I really have not found a good solution for this problem so far, so I would appreciate any help or correction if I got anything wrong. If I find a solution regarding this problem, I would spend 1 week in China until I enter Mongolia.

Mongolia, also a country I wanted to travel to very desperately. I will roughly spend 2 weeks in Mongolia.

I'm going to enter the PR China again at this border control: [https://maps.app.goo.gl/NhXnLnneP4qrhQjg6](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NhXnLnneP4qrhQjg6)

I will continue to drive eastwards to Peking, then Tianjin, and after that I will stay at the coast all the way south till I enter Vietnam. I'm probably going to stay a little bit in Shanghai and Peking, but as I already mentioned earlier. I prefer nature over cities, so maybe I will find some pretty places along the way. Estimation for PR China is 4 weeks.

I'm putting together Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand here since I am probably going to cross the border a couple of times probably until I enter PR China north of Thailand again. Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand will also roughly take 2 weeks.

Thailand will be just a brief visit since I have already visited it, and it simply is a target for a later journey.

Bhutan and Nepal both together will take 3 weeks since I would like to take some time for myself in the NP Annapurna.

India is the next big country I'm going to spend a lot of time in. Mostly at the north side close to the Himalayas. 3-4 weeks is what I'm supposed to spend in India until I re-enter PR China and make myself back on the way home. From entering the PR-China, I'm going back on the route from Kaxgar to Almaty. From there, all the way across Kazakhstan to the port, I arrived and back with a ferry to Baku. From there, the same home I arrived in in the first place. From India until home, I estimated 3 weeks.

After arriving in Austria, I will continue my journey westwards to Gibraltar, where I will park my bus and hitchhike a sailboat. In online forums, I have heard of a concept called hand against cot (""Hand gegen Kojüte"" in German). Hopefully I will find a ship pretty soon there that's crossing the Atlantic at a cheap price or, at best, for free. After arriving wherever in the Caribbean, I'm going to take a flight to Buenos Aires, where there are ""frequent flights"" to Río Gallegos in the south of Argentina. There I would buy a used/cheap motorcycle and travel from South America to North America for another 5.5 months (24 weeks). I would sleep in a tent and live off daily groceries like noodles or local food. I'm not going to lean into singular countries regarding a route or time estimations since I believe I can decide pretty much on the way what I would like to see in what time. But rough estimations are

South America—2.5 Months (11 Weeks)

* Brazil 2 Weeks
* Argentina 3 Weeks
* Bolivia + Chile 3 Weeks
* Peru + Colombia 3 Weeks

North America—3 Months (13 Weeks)

* Panama + Costa Rica + Nicaragua + Honduras + Guatemala 2 Weeks
* Mexico 3 Weeks
* USA 4 Weeks
* Canada 4 Weeks

I'm also not quite sure on how to get from South America to North America in the cheapest way possible.

My overall budget for the gas, food, water, etc., so basically for the entire journey, will be €17,000 (the bus is already paid, so it's just the motorcycle).

Thanks for reading this very, very long and detailed plan of my world trip. If there are any missing information in this text, route optimizations, tips for beautiful secret places the tourists don't know about, or even just a comment regarding this idea as a whole. I appreciate it. ;)

1jkahw2,reddit,Chinese student travel LAX → DUB → AMS transfer issues in Dublin?,"Hello, 

I have an issue and having a hard time getting a solution. 

We're a group of students, including a Chinese student, travelling home with this itinerary with Aer Lingus:

LAX →DUB  
21 May 20:15 - 14:30 (+1 day)  
  
DUB → AMS   
22 May 18:20 - 20:55

We all bought our tickets together, and she got her visa for US but now this transfer in Dublin is confusing us. It says:

""If both your arrival flight and onward connecting flight are in Terminal 2 between the hours of 04:00 and 16:00 on the same day, you can use a transit visa in this case."" 

China is not on the list of of countries that needs this, but the connecting flight is after the 04:00-16:00. Can she go through to the gate already or will there be issues? 

If she gets an earlier flight before 16:00 to Copenhagen and then to Amsterdam, would it be okay or will she be stopped in Los Angeles? 

We need to know if she has to book another flight, which would also be much more expensive and she doesn't have that kind of money. Any help or guidance is greatly appreciated!

We wrote the airport who said we should contact the embassy and we also got through the airline telephone after trying for many hours, and he said we should also check with the embassy but that it should be fine (?).

Thank you!!!

I don't mind changing trains, I only have a small 40 liter backpack with me. I don't fly until late in the evening and would have the whole last day there on site.

So doing something like the Ha Giang loop, which many people recommend, seems a bit of a stretch - neither of us ride motorbikes and some of the safety concerns seem a bit worrying to me! However we do want to avoid things which are super super touristy e.g manufactured purely for tourists and to sell you stuff

Places we've got on a short list to see so far are:

- Hanoi - 3 nights
- Lan Ha Bay cruise (maybe) - 2 nights
- Sapa (maybe) - 2 nights
- Ninh Binh - 1 (or 2) nights
- Hoi An - (? nights)
- Hue - (? nights)
- Da Nang (fly back to Hanoi)

I'm currently unsure about Sapa or the bay cruise - have read some mixed things about both in terms of how touristy they are.

My main concern with going to all these places is just how much time we'll spend travelling. We do still want to relax and have some time to spend in nice accomodation, as opposed to being on sleeper trains the whole time - but on the other hand most of the places don't necessarily seem like they have enough to do for more than a 3 night stay?

Would be great to get some advice on how to balance moving about constantly with staying put but not getting too bored!

1k4d5u5,reddit,Need itinerary feedback - 11 days in Italy,"Hey all, sharing my brief itinerary and details. Would really appreciate your inputs, suggestions. Let me know if any additional info required. Thank you so much in advance.

Pax: 2 (me and my wife)
Arrival & exit: Milan (28th May)- Rome (8th June)
Accommodation: Mix of Hotels and Airbnb

Verona 
28th-29th-30th-31st (4 nights)

I am making Verona as my base to explore. We want to visit all beautiful sights of Verona, enjoy food experience and simply soak in the north Italian charm.
Day trips we wish to do from Verona: Lake Garda, Padua
Day-1: Verona
Day-2: Lake Garda, Sirmione (Brescia it time permits)
Day-3: Padua, Vicenza
Day-4: Trento (or at leisure in Verona)

Florence 
1st-2nd-3rd June (3 nights)

We want to enjoy Florence, but reading it to be tourist trap and expensive theme park; I’m unsure where to stay. Does it make sense to stay in Florence? Or we could base ourselves somewhere on outskirts?
Day-1: Florence
Day-2: Florence
Day-3: Pisa-Lucca-Florence

Pienza/Montepulciano/Grosseto/Sienna: 
4th-5th June (2 nights)

Will do one/two of above places. Undecided where to stay. But the region is so beautiful, I don’t want to miss it

Rome: 
6th-7th-8th

I think Rome will easily take 3 days to explore. We will add a day trip is possible to explore something around. Open to suggestions.

I really wish to do Naples with day trip to somewhere Sorrento/Ischia. But it looks very difficult unless I sacrifice day in Verona/Tuscany.

How does this look? Is it doable? Both of us are 36, and decently fit. Any suggestions on where to stay or some experience/food/tour that you highly recommend? I have only booked flights so far, and itinerary and stay etc are still open-pending.

1k3yuo1,reddit,11 Day Peru Itinerary Advice,"Hey everyone! My wife and I are headed to Peru for an 11 day trip and would love some feedback/suggestions. We’re flying into Lima late on the first day and staying in the airport hotel. Then heading to Cusco early on Day 2. We want to see Machu Picchu, Sacred Valley, Cusco, and possibly Lake Humantay and Rainbow Mountain. We had originally thought to see another region in Peru as well but after some research it seems like this could cause us to be too rushed. We want to see a lot but dont want to constantly be on the move. 



Itinerary:

\* Day 1 – Arrive in Lima. Stay at airport hotel

\* Day 2 – Fly to Cusco (early AM), chill, explore, acclimate

\* Day 3 – Cusco day – explore San Blas, Qorikancha. Take it easy to continue acclimating. 

\* Day 4 – Sacred Valley day trip: Pisac, Ollantaytambo, Moray, Maras

\* Would it make more sense to stay in Ollantaytambo this night or head straight to Aguas Calientes?

\* Day 5–6/7 – Machu Picchu (ideally a 2-day, 1-night or 3-day, 2-night tour)

\* Having trouble picking a tour of Machu Pichu. It seems like there at 4D/3N and 2D/1N tours ( we’d love a 3D/2N lol). But confused as to how to get a mix of hiking + train which both seem really cool and unique. 

\* Day 7 – Return to Cusco

\* Day 8 – Day trip to Lake Humantay/Rainbow Mountain

\* Day 9 – Day trip to Lake Humantay/Rainbow Mountain 

\* Day 10 – Final full day in Cusco 

\* Day 11 – Fly from Cusco to Lima → fly home late that night



Questions:

\* Does this itinerary feel too rushed or too drawn out? Are we allowing enough rest and acclimation time? I'm especially concerned about the two day trips in a row. 

\* Anything I’,m completely missing?

\* Tour company recs?

\* I had a thought to stay in sacred valley but having trouble figuring out logistics as most tours seem to leave from Cusco. 

\- would another Peru region make sense or should we stick to this area?

\- Any hotel or general recs are appreciated!!

  
Thank You!!

My current passport expires in July 2025, and I’ve started researching the renewal process. From what I understand, whether you do it online or by mail, you have to send in your old passport and wait for the new one, which is tricky for me.

Ideally, I’m looking for a way to renew while holding on to my current passport or minimizing the time I’m without it. I’m totally open to other ideas too, like getting Global Entry if that could help in any way, or going to a passport agency in person if that would be faster.

1k2bwck,reddit,"Help us pick our last US trip together: PNW, Yellowstone, or Florida?","Hi everyone!

My friend and I are planning a one-week trip in mid-May and trying to choose between three very different travel options in the US. Each has its own appeal, but we’re having trouble deciding what would make for the most memorable and enjoyable experience—especially since this might be our last big trip together before she moves abroad.

Here are the options we’re considering:

Seattle + Portland (PNW) – We’re drawn to the vibe, food scene, nearby nature, and walkable neighborhoods. We’re not planning any hardcore hikes—just want to soak in the city energy, maybe visit some parks, and enjoy the coastal atmosphere.

Yellowstone and nearby areas – We’d have to join a tour since we don’t drive. It seems like a once-in-a-lifetime kind of place, but we’re unsure if May is a good time to visit, or if a group tour would feel rushed or exhausting.

Florida (Orlando + Miami) – The mix of theme parks and beaches is tempting, but we’re worried it might be too crowded or touristy in May. That said, it could also be a super fun and carefree choice.

A few notes about us:

We won’t be renting a car, so accessibility via public transport or tours is a big factor.
We like city exploring, scenic views, cultural spots, and some time in nature—but nothing too physically demanding.

Ideally, we’re hoping for something meaningful and low-stress, with minimal logistics to worry about.

Would love to hear your thoughts or experiences with any of these options—especially if you've done them without a car. Thanks in advance!

Update:
Just wanna add another option: San Francisco + Yosemite/or somewhere near SF

We are not considering driving since my friend was in a car accident a while ago and still feels uneasy about driving, and I don’t feel confident driving long distances in unfamiliar places either😢",2025-04-18 18:24:54,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,2,115,,0.52,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k2bwck/help_us_pick_our_last_us_trip_together_pnw/,Shoddy-Wait-5886

1k261ls,reddit,Overnight in Rome or Dublin with an afternoon flight,"I'm looking at some options for a company trip to Split, Croatia from PHL in September. The options I'm seeing on the return all (well, most) leave SPU too late in the day to connect through any of the westbound transatlantic hubs like LHR, FCO, or DUB on the same day, so they all have some level of overnight layover. I've been to London a bunch and would like to go somewhere I've not been.

The two options I'm looking at, one gets into Rome at 2200 on a Friday, and I'd fly out at 1310 Saturday. The other gets into Dublin at 1635 Saturday and I'd fly out 0930 Sunday.

So the Rome flight gets in late but also gives me time the next morning; the Dublin flight gets in earlier but is a pretty early flight out, and I'm kinda leaning away from that for that reason. Never having been to Rome, and only spending one day in Dublin decades ago, I'm not sure which airport is easier to get to/from the city center, nor what the cities are like either on a Saturday morning (Rome) or a Saturday night (Dublin). Can anyone provide some input about transit experiences in those cities?

If it helps in terms of policies, the airline would either be American or BA.

* Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, bakery hopping (La Maison Rose, Du Pain et des Idées, Carette)
* Walking Champs-Élysées, grabbing dinner near Saint-Émilion
* Not doing Louvre or Versailles — keeping it scenic and food-focused

**📍Strasbourg (3 nights)**

* Day trip to Colmar (return by train)
* Petite France, Place Kléber, local winstubs, cathedral
* Trying local bakeries and chill walks around the riverside
* Staying near the station

**📍Lyon (3 nights)**

* Bouchon dinner (Les Lyonnais), and another at Carmelo
* May do the 2-hour e-bike tour if the weather’s nice
* Exploring Vieux Lyon, traboules, Parc de la Tête d’Or, and checking out Presqu’île
* Staying fairly central

**📍Nice (3 nights)**

* Promenade des Anglais, flower market, beach strolls
* One day trip to Eze, plus a walk up to the Jardin Exotique
* Food will be light and local — socca, seafood, pastries

**📍Amsterdam (4 nights)**

* Exploring the city by tram and foot
* Anne Frank House, Keukenhof, and a half-day out to Zaandam + Zaanse Schans
* Cafés like Lanskroon, Fabel Friet, Winkel 43

1k0mi9y,reddit,Thoughts on 7-Day Uzbekistan Tour. Should We Add Bukhara?,"Dear all,

We're getting a 7-day group tour of Uzbekistan for $1100 per person. The package includes daily breakfast and no other meals, but does not include a visit to Bukhara.

We’re wondering, since Bukhara is a city we really want to see, do you think it’s worth extending the trip to include it? Or is this already a good deal for first-time travellers to Uzbekistan?

Here’s the itinerary for reference:

**UZBEKISTAN 07 DAYS GROUP TOUR with SAMARKAND DAY TRIP** 🎡🤩  
**Departure Date:** ✈️ *15 May 2025*  
**Price:** 💰 *Rs 290,000 Only*

**Package Inclusions:**

* 🛂 Visa Invitation + Group Visa (Fees Included)
* ✈️ Return Air Tickets Included
* 🌆 6 Nights in Tashkent
* 🌃 4-Star International Standard Hotels
* ☕ Daily Breakfast Included
* 🕌 Full-Day Tashkent City Tour
* 🏔️ Amirsoy Mountains Trip with Cable Car Ride
* 🚄 Bullet Train Tashkent – Samarkand – Tashkent
* 🛍️ Shopping Tour & more
* 🧑🏻‍✈️ Tour Guide & Leader throughout
* 🚎 Luxury Transportation
* 📑 All Taxes & Service Charges Included

Looking forward to your suggestions! TIA.

EDIT: Thanks so much, everyone, for the clarity! I have a lot more information now to make a wise decision. We're probably going to try adding Bukhara if it's possible or we might ditch the whole trip altogether and wait for a better one. I’d love to include Khiva too, but unfortunately, I can’t take more than a week off.",2025-04-16 14:58:53,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,2,23,,0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k0mi9y/thoughts_on_7day_uzbekistan_tour_should_we_add/,Nocturnal_Nymph_
1k0jd6v,reddit,Help me choose - Tanzania (2 options),"Hi all, I'm in the midst of planning a bucket list vacation for my husband and I to Tanzania in November 2026, combining time spent on safari with time spent relaxing on the beach in Zanzibar. I've narrowed down to two itineraries/quotes and am having trouble deciding between the two. They have many similarities - length of time, route, private guide/car the entire time on safari.  
  
Would love your takes and/or first-hand reviews of either operator or any of the accommodations. I'm particularly wondering if quote 1 is too good to be true?!

**Option 1 - Operator is Easy Travel Tanzania**

*Total Price:* $20,652 CAD

*Accommodations*: Lemala Ngorongoro Tented Camp, Lemala Nanyukie, Zuri Zanzibar 

*Pros*: LOVE all of the accommodations provided. Company seems to have very positive reviews online, is a member of TATO. Cheaper option.

*Cons*: Slightly less professional communications compared to other operator. Quote was a bit less clear - providing us with total price per person for the safari portion but then providing individual nightly cost for the Zanzibar portion. Also quoting based on 2025 rates, noting that the lodges haven't yet released 2026 but we can hold at 2025 rates for now and pay the difference later. Is this normal? 

*Other notes:* Local company based in Tanzania and specialized focus on this nation.  


**Option 2 - Operator is Vaya Adventures** 

*Total Price:* $24,575 CAD  
*Accommodations*: Lemala Ngorongoro Tented Camp, Serengeti Acacia Bliss, Zuri Zanzibar 

*Pros*: Still very much into all accommodations provided, only difference between the two itineraries is the Serengeti location. Company seems to have very positive reviews online. Communication has been impeccable, very clear and professional information sharing. 

*Cons*: More expensive, don't like the Serengeti location as much as the Lamala Nanyukie in option 1. 

*Other notes:* Not local to Tanzania but work with local operators/guides. Company does not solely specialize in safari/Tanzania although this is a main focus area. They seem to offer luxury travel primarily in Africa & South America. Does include more note of stops throughout the trip and guided visits to villages, Stone Town while in Zanzibar etc.",2025-04-16 12:37:35,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,2,22,,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k0jd6v/help_me_choose_tanzania_2_options/,mmeast
1k0bapc,reddit,Switzerland 8 Day Itinerary,"We are a group of 5 people in our late 20s traveling from NYC to Switzerland in late may to early june (5/30 - 6/7). We are going to be in Germany the week before so we are taking the train from Munich to Zurich on 5/30. First time visitors and open to anything - a bit of hikes (not too intensive though). Looking for advice or any additional recs for the following rough itinerary - thank you!

Travel wise, planning to look on the SBB app - looks like it might be better for us to the saver day pass and half fare card instead of the Swiss Travel Pass.

5/30 Zurich 

* Arrive in early afternoon
* Explore western old town, Lindenhof, walk around the lake 
* Lindt chocolate museum 
* Kunsthaus Zürich

5/31 - 6/3 Lauterbrunnen - Grindelwald - Lake Brienz (with Wengen as base)

Avoiding Interlaken as base after reading through reviews (though yes it is convenient as a travel hub) 

5/31 Lauterbrunnen

* Hike in the valley and visit the Trümmelbach Falls, Staubbach Falls, Weisse Lutschine, take the cable car up to Murren
* If time allows, go up to Schilthorn as well 

6/1 Grindelwald

* Mannlichen Royal Walk
* Mannlichen to Kleine Scheidegg hike
* Grindelwald First 
* Anything else we should do?

6/2 Lake Brienz

* Giessbach Falls 
* Brienzer Rothorn - Cogweel train for the scenic ride
* Gelmerbahn
* Harder Kulm back in Interlaken
* Debated between Lake Brienz or Lake Oeschinensee but Lake Brienz is more convenient. Half of us are leaving that day so figured Lake Brienz is better. Appreciate any advice here! 

6/3 Lucerne

* Explore old town, museums and take a boat tour

6/4 Lucerne

* Lake Lucerne to Vitznau via boat, then cogwheel train up to Rigi, and cable car down 

6/5 Bern

6/6 Geneva (day trip to Montreux)

* Prefer checking out Montruex vs. staying in Geneva 
* Lavaux Vineyard, Lake Geneva

6/7 Geneva to NYC

1jzg9la,reddit,Sardinia vs Albanian Riviera: which one to choose for an 12-day trip in June,"In early June I'll travel with my parents to Italy (14 days) and we'll end the trip in Sardinia (4 days). We'll flight to Cagliari, drive to Villasimius and sleep there. In the next day we'll drive to Santa Maria Navarrese or Cala Gonone and stay in the nearest beaches. Then, we'll do a boat trip through Orosei Gulf (I'm thinking about doing a hike to a secluded beach like Cala Goloritzé, meet the boat there and continue the day with them). They still need to buy the flight back to Rome to leave Italy so the last day depends on that (ie if we have to go to Olbia then we need to plan for an itinerary that we'll be different than if they flight back from Alghero or Cagliari).

I'll be in Europe for 12 extra days and during 5 of those days I'll have to work remotely, starting at 2pm - which means that I have the mornings to explore. I'm very doubtful if I stay in Sardine or if I visit somewhere else like Albanian Riviera.

In Sardinia, I'd visit other beaches in the Orosei like Cala Luna, Cala Sisine, Cala Mariolu and some other hikes like Pedra Longa trail and Passo Ghenna Silana → Gorropu Canyon. I could continue going North and although I haven't researched much, everyone says it's even prettier than Gulf of Orosei, which I already found absolutely astonishing from the pictures I saw.

In Albania Riviera, I'd most likely stay in Himarë. Using it as a base, I could explore the nearby beaches: Filikuri, Jale, Qeparo, Celestina, Livadhi, Aquarium, Gjipe, etc. Hike to Porto Palermo, Himara Castle, etc. Could also visit Gjirokastër for a day trip or even stay a couple days. I could even go south at the end of my trip, get a boat to Corfu, stay one or two days there and flight back to Milan.

In a nutshell, Sardinia seems more beautiful and more expensive. Albanian Riviera overall costs are appealing to me even if the nature is not in the same league as Sardinia's. I'm very curious to taste Albanian food and I think I'll get bored with Italian food. Sardinia's hikes look more challenging, which means I'd need my hiking boots - which sounds like downside if I want to travel light.

Please, help me decide! Are my assumptions correct? Am there any aspects I'm not considering?",2025-04-15 01:56:21,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,2,3,,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jzg9la/sardinia_vs_albanian_riviera_which_one_to_choose/,MuriloScarpa

What are some good travel insurance options for this kind of situation? Do people just use the trip insurance offered by airlines at checkout? If I want to cancel or reschedule, I guess it might not be a ""covered cancellation"" option as I don't think ""this trip doesn't fit my schedule"" counts as a covered reason. 

  
Also- what are some options for insurance for things like flight cancellations or delays?  I never really bought insurance in the past, as I was young and just bought the cheapest tickets and if something didn't work out, just toughed it out.

1jyjsdm,reddit,Menorca or Costa Brava (or Costa del Sol)?,"Hello! My wife and I are trying to decide on a place to stay in Spain in the second half of May. We are looking for a good beach spot specifically. Last year we were on the Greek island of MIlos for the seaside part of our trip, where we were spoiled for beaches. We would like to stay somewhere similar in terms of quality of beaches and water.

This year we are trying to decide between Costa Brava or Menorca. Costa de Sol is also a consideration, but seems underwhelming compared to the other two locations. But, if you have it, we would love to hear evidence to the contrary. 

So for us the major things to consider are: temperature (both daily and water temps in late May), quality of beaches and surrounding landscapes, and a relaxed and local feel to the place we’ll stay. Food is also very important, and the possibility of nice hikes and walks are very welcome.

We will be there for about eight days in the second half of May. If we go with Costa Brava, with its higher latitude, would the water feel much colder than Menorca, enough to prevent us from considering it? Aside from the beaches, it seems that Costa Brava has a host of wonderful small towns from which to choose. While Menorca offers more beaches, and more of a getaway from everything.

Grand Canyon, Four corners, Yosemite, and Sequoia National Park

I have been thinking about making a 3/4 week trip to California for a long time.
I have been living in a rental home for a year now, but this plan has always been on my bucket list.
I do have fixed costs, but I think this is a good time to do it within a year.

I am currently 26 years old, male living in the Netherlands.
Unfortunately, friends do not want to come along, because they think it is too expensive and I understand that from their point of view.

Is a group trip something? Can you do it on your own?
What other tips can you give me?

we are making a 35 days road trip in central Europe this summer. In Austria we will see Vienna (4 nights) , Graz (2 nights) , and Wachau Valley (2 nights in Krems). We have 5 others nights. For now we have 2 nights near Zell am See and 3 nights in Bad Aussee. We already neem to Salzburg in another trip 

After done some reading it seems that:  
1) Zell Am See could be skipped  
2) Bad Aussee is not a good base for Salzkagermmut

We have chose Zell Am See mainly because we would like to do the Grossglockner road. The thing is that that road have to been on a clear sky day to be enjoyable.

1jwmarx,reddit,2 weeks in Yucatan: my itinerary!,"Hi, in a week i'm travelling to Mexico for 3 weeks. The first week we are going to spend in CDMX, we already have a good itinerary (suggestions always welcome!).

After CDMX we're taking the plane to Yucatan. I have created a itinerary for travelling around Yucatan in 2 weeks. We are going to rent a car, so transportation is no issue.

Below my summary, suggestions/tips & tricks are welcome!

  
**Day 1 --> 3 (3 nights) : Isla Mujeres**

* We want to start off with a couple of days on the beach and really take our rest. Hoblox was our first choice but ultimately decided on Mujeres because it's close to the airport and no immediate need for a rental car/taking a bus.

**Day 4 --> 6 (3 nights) : Valladolid**

* Visiting the town
* Ek Balam
* Cenotes (like Chichikan/ Xchanche

**Day 7 --> 10 (4 nights): Merida**

* First day: from Valladolid to Merida: do Chichen Itza on our way. If we have time also Izamal in the late afternoob
* Visiting the city
* Progresso, (my girlfriend loves raccoons and wants to visit Reserva Ecológica El Corchito
* Cenotes at Homun (Cenote Santa Bárbara)
* Celestun maybe, but Flamingos are already gone??

**Day 10 --> 12 (3 nights): Bacalar**

* First day: from Merida to Uxmal, afternoon a 5hr drive to Bacalar
* Spend time at the lagoon
* Boat tour at Canal de los Piratas
* Rapidos not really worth it?

**Day 12 --> 14 (3 nights): Coba/Tulum**

* Found a hotel between Coba and Tulum which is so much cheaper than a hotel right in Tulum
* Coba ruins
* Snorkeling at Akumal
* Cenotes/beach days",2025-04-11 10:07:36,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,2,4,,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jwmarx/2_weeks_in_yucatan_my_itinerary/,Laulaufuego

I’m currently planning a week long trip in May with my girlfriend. We both need to back in Toulouse by the 25th so ideally we go back on the 24th. 

Our current plan is to spend time in Nice exploring the city with possible day trips to Cannes and Antibes. Then travel back to Toulouse via Marseille and Montpellier, spending a couple of nights here, to see the flamingos. 

Here is rough itinerary 
Nice - 4 days, 3 nights
Marseille - 2 days, 1 night
Montpellier - 3 days, 2 nights
Toulouse - 1 night then fly

Now the question is do we try to maximise our time in Nice/Montpellier or stop off in Marseille to break up the travelling. We are trying to enjoy the food, wine and beaches but would like to try to go on a hike and experience interesting cultural activities (museums, monuments, etc.). Nightlife in terms of wine bars and cocktails would suffice, we don’t need to go clubbing.

I’m looking for some advice for our Turkey trip this May/June. It’ll be my parents, my husband, and me — and it’s our first time visiting Turkey!

We’ll be there for 22 days (21 nights) and plan to rent a car. I decided to skip Cappadocia this time since it’s easy to fly there later, and we don’t want to spend too much time driving on this trip.

Here’s the first draft of our itinerary: I have about 17 nights planned so far. For the remaining 4 nights, I’m thinking of adding extra nights to a few places to make the trip less rushed and more enjoyable.

* Add 1 more night each to Denizli, Kuşadası, Isparta, and Afyonkarahisar. **or**
* Add 1 more night each to Kuşadası, Fethiye, Antalya, and Isparta.
* Or what would you suggest?

I have no idea what I'm doing.,"Wife and I have never been west of the Mississippi River, and when we last planned a trip out West, it was cancelled due to us having a baby. We are now planning a trip to California for our 10 year anniversary in three years with our then-to-be 8 year old daughter. 

The rough-rough draft of our vacation plan is to fly into Fresno, head East to Monterey for a few days to whale watch, explore, and get some beach time in, and then head back to Fresno where we will then commute each day to either Yosemite or Sequoia National Parks. 

So, I have a few questions:

1. Is there a better place between Yosemite and Sequoia National Parks to stay? We chose Fresno due to the airport and reasonable distance between the two parks.
2. Is there a better bay-town, whale-watching area that is close by?
3. Would this trip be too much for an 8 year old?
4. Are any areas of the parks closed in mid-late April?
5. Does $6k seem doable for this trip over 9 or 10 days? We will lodge affordably, but comfortably, and eat fairly cheap. This price is being based on the hopes that our economy recovers by then.

I also welcome any travel tips or information pertaining to the areas we will be traveling to, as well as suggestions for other things to do while we're in the area. I think we plan on spending 9 or 10 days total, and we don't get many opportunities to do a trip like this, so that's why we're trying to cram so much in, while hopefully not taking away from each place.

1jsyacm,reddit,Can someone either talk me into or out of this proposed itinerary? (Advice: Madrid/Granada),"Hello all. 

I am looking at a few options for travel later in the year (specifically November, although it doesn't have to be this month) and I was looking at Granada to see Alhambra. November is ideal for me based on my work schedule and also having mild weather for the region at that time of year. 

However, I see that there looks to only be one flight in to Granada each day, connecting from Madrid. I know that Malaga airport exists as well and is relatively close by, although getting to Granada would be another headache that I wouldn't want to deal with after a long transcontinental flight (I am from the US) and a connecting flight, and language barrier (my Spanish is okay, but I don't feel confident about it enough to really trust it-- I would also be doing this solo, which compounds my fears a little bit too) which would always stress me out. So, seeing as how I am not particularly comfortable about this, my alternate thinking would be to fly into Madrid and treat it as a long layover in a sense (I've always wanted to see Madrid too, but this would obviously not be doing it justice, which is another concern of mine-- would I be doing it just to check off a box, you know?) 

The flights I am currently looking into would land in Madrid at around 8:00 or 10:00 local time. I figure that would give me enough time to see at least most of the key sights in the city at a leisurely enough pace (I am mainly only really interested in the Royal Palace-- however not going in for a tour or anything like that-- and Parque del Retiro if I only had less than a day) as well as doing some self-guided walking tours, etc. 

That being the case, I would spend the night in Madrid and then take a train the next day to Granada and stay there for a few days, seeing the main sights of the city on arrival day, Alhambra the next day, and then a hike in the Sierra Nevada the next day. The tricky bit that I am wondering about is whether it is worth it to train back to Madrid and spend another day there before I depart back to the US or potentially fly back out of Granada (I think this would be more expensive). I would just be stressed about that because with only one flight out of Granada a day, if I missed it, I would be screwed. 

Basically, I am wondering if it would be a waste of time (and money, hotels in Madrid for these two nights would be more than what I have estimated my whole time in Granada to cost, for instance) to follow the below schedule: 

Nov. 21 -- Land in Madrid, see a few sights, etc. 

Nov 22-25 -- Train to Granada. Checking out of hotel on 11/25 and getting the train back to Madrid on that date. 

Nov 25 -- Back in Madrid and fly out the next day -- I would probably stay somewhere close to the airport just out of my own paranoia and so I can rest easy knowing I can get to the airport quickly and stress less about it on a tighter schedule (the return flight would be at around 10:00 in the morning). 

I am planning on doing something similar when I go to Ireland in a couple of months, where I'll be landing in Dublin, moving partway through to Belfast, and then returning the final day of the trip to go back to Dublin/airport area rather than trying to make a more complicated journey to the airport on the date of the return flight (I am a very nervous person in case you couldn't tell). Any information or advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you!

TL;DR -- Would you spend less than a day in Madrid before going off to Granada or would you try connecting from Madrid-- either to Malaga or Granada proper?

**Questions:**

3. Would you recommend a day trip from Tarifa to Tangier? Neither Tarifa and Tangier seem to have many attractions, so the main reason to go there would be to experience crossing the Gibraltar Strait. However, I also saw that Tangier is full of scammers.

1js95vi,reddit,Trip Report: 8 days Solo-Travel in Florida from the UK,"**Summary:**

I solo travelled for 8 days (from the UK):

* 5 days in Orlando, within Disney World accommodation
* 3 days in Miami in South Beach (originally going to be 4 but left a day early)

*I caught a cold the day before my flight to Florida, so I shoved down medicine/cough suppressants every day but I ended up leaving Miami a day early, partly because of that and partly because I felt I was still jet lagged.*

  
**Itinerary:**

**Day 0** \- Arrived in evening in Orlando

**Day 1**: Kennedy Space Centre Day

This was pretty amazing - they have great tours within the key attractions. I found 1 day was sufficient to tick off the big name attractions, the Saturn V exhibit and the Atlantis Exhibit. Like others have said these were both awesome and worth seeing.

**Day 2**: Disney World Magic Kingdom  
**Day 3**: Disney World Hollywood Studios  
**Day 4**: Disney World Animal Kingdom  
**Day 5**: Disney World Epcot

**Day 6:** Took Brightline Train to Miami and stayed in South Beach area

**Day 7:** General exploring, hanging out on beach, going to Little Havana

**Day 8:** Ended up taking an early flight home this evening

  
**General comments about Orlando:**

My Orlando leg was centred around Disney World, and so I picked accommodation in Disney World to avoid having to travel into Disney World repeatedly. This turned out to be a pretty good decision.

I'd definitely recommend this as you can fairly easily get in and out of Disney World with Ubers or with a rented car.



**General comments about Disney World Accomodation:**

I stayed at All Star Movies Resort which along with the other All Stars is fairly budget compared to other hotels. 

Overall impression:

* The food is not great but if you're only there to have breakfast and are eating out otherwise then it's fine. I couldn't imagine having more than 1 meal a day here.
* Transportation is great - they have quite frequent (every 15 to 30 mins) shuttle buses to each of the major parks
* Have basic amenities, such as shops with medicine, quick food supplies, hats etc...
* My one criticism off this place is the level of sound you can hear from neighbours can be a lot, particularly when you have a young family next door which you probably will! Partly because of this, I struggled to get a decent sleep which really didn't help... I probably wouldn't stay here again because of this.

**General comments about Disney World Parks:**

I'm in my 30s so I wasn't sure how I'd find Disney World, but I had a really positive experience. I'm not a massive rollercoaster person so the rides at Disney were for the most part a good balance between being scary/exciting and being approachable and more fun for someone who isn't into crazy rides.

Favourite rides: The seven dwarfs, Pirates of the Carribean, Haunted Mansion (all in magic kingdom).

In addition to the rides, the parks do musical events, parades, and other events which are really nostalgic.

Favourite attraction/event: Fantasmic in Hollywood Studios. This and the Magic Kingdom fireworks evening show do such a great job of making all these invented world and characters come alive and making you part of it.

IMO this was the highlight of my Orlando leg.

  
**General comments about Miami:**

Quite expensive in comparison to similar places in London. I found it easy to be spending almost 100 dollars on a meal.

South Beach is quite walkable, but in comparison the rest of Miami is not really walkable.



**General comments about Florida**

**Transportation**

I always forget when I come to the USA how much more car oriented the cities are. Even in Miami which had some walkable areas (e.g. South Beach), the streets feel much less friendly to pedestrians versus a European city.

When I stayed in All Star Movies in Disney World, I saw there was a streak restaurant about 15 mins walk away in principle, but there was literally no way you could walk there because of the way the surrounding area is built (e.g. due to having to cross dual carriageways with no pedestrian crossings or no sidewalks).

I did research transportation options and decided Uber would be my primary mode of getting around (e.g. from Disney World accomodation to Kennedy Space Centre, and getting around Miami, and to and from airports). Overall this was fairly cost effective and much less hassle than trying to rent a car when I don't drive at all in London. I'd definitely recommend this for others.

On getting from Orlando to Miami, there is a train called the Brightline which is in general much better than what most US states. This is a very cost effective way of getting from North to South Florida so again would recommend this (paid about 70 dollars for a ticket, 3.5 hours travel time).  


**Weather**

I travelled from late march to early april (after postponing my original trip planned in October 2024) and the weather was great (high 20s Celcius) and not too humid.

I'd definitely recommend planning your Florida trip to avoid the more humid months or hurricane risky months which you can research online.



**Other Comments:**

As I said I caught a cold the day before my flight and it wasn't so bad that I felt the need to cancel completely. I powered through but it did still make it tough to enjoy the trip as much, particularly in Miami.

The flights in particular are brutal with a cold - not only do you feel the normal dehydrating and potential nausea but you can get the painful pressure effect on your ears and forehead due to being congested during ascent and descent. 

I recommend having at least 1/3 litre of water to drink before ascent and before descent to ease the congestion as well as the usual decongestants - the water basically gets rid of any potential pain.



**Overall:**

Travelling in the USA is always interesting and different. I've used to London urban planning and have been to Italy/Spain/Greece/France/Thailand/Japan and overall I find it much more comfortable and easy to navigate in the pedestrianised and public transport heavy cities like Rome or Tokyo.

Walking around parts of Miami in particular it just feels sort of soul less some times with the lack of people on the streets as everyone is in cars. Again, just my personal experience.

  
Would definitely go again to Miami to have a more exciting trip, doing more water activities, hopefully without being congested and jetlagged next time!",2025-04-05 17:48:46,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,2,2,,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1js95vi/trip_report_8_days_solotravel_in_florida_from_the/,Ok-Bug8833

Any thoughts/tips are greatly appreciated.
Below is not so much an itinerary as much as it is a list of ideas.

I’m interested in soaking up as much culture as I can. Art, architecture, food, beaches and hiking. I enjoy live music, nightlife & dancing but I don’t drink anymore so the party scene isn’t a focus necessarily.  


I fly into Porto and have 10 days to get to Lisbon.
I thought about doing a 2-3 day portion of the Camino de Santiago but in the opposite direction (towards Lisbon) and wonder if it will be “worth it”? 
Coimbra comes highly suggested and once in Lisbon I’d like to do a day trip to Sintra.
This keeps me pretty inland so if there are other towns/villages you suggest to see or something along the coast that is a must please let me know!

Once in Lisbon I fly to the Azores for 1 week for a retreat so this portion is already planned out.

When back in Lisbon in late May I then have 2+ weeks to do Spain. I don’t have a return flight yet so one thought is I could boogie from Lisbon up to San Sebastián > Barcelona > Andalucía > back to Lisbon for return flight
OR Lisbon > Andalucía > Barcelona > San Sebastián > Madrid or Porto for return flight

I’d like to see Andalucía - Seville, Córdoba, Granada, and Malaga all get recommended - how do I decide?? Is Gribaltar worth getting to?
San Sebastián & Barcelona are both on my list. 
Madrid I’ve heard mixed reviews about. Many say it is a must but some say they preferred Barcelona so maybe it can be skipped? It’s a nice halfway point from Andalucía though so it could be easily done, I’m sure. 
Are there any towns less traveled that I’m missing out on?

I am flying out of ABE to Japan and the route requires we take a bus from ABE to Newark prior to flying out.

The question is, should I still get to ABE \~3 hours early for an international flight? Or would this not be needed because Newark is the international portion, and it would be okay to get there \~2 hours in advance?

The original plan was to make the same trip as I did a few years back, plus my bf and friend have never seen any of those sights I visited, so that would make it even better. BUT, this time I want to hike down to the Colorado River and camp for a few nights. I also wanted to camp at Havasu, but the cost is just not in my budget as of right now. I do plan on making a trip back to the Grand Canyon, hopefully in the next couple of years to camp on the Havasupai Reservation though. Realizing that we wouldn't be able to do Havasu this time around, I got super bummed and my friend (who is going with us) then suggested Yosemite, neither I or my bf have visited Yosemite, but my friend has and he loved it. However, they both told me that it is up for me to decide since it'll be a birthday trip, but both places are insanely beautiful just from photos, but the Grand Canyon has my heart lol. 

The cost of doing the Grand Canyon trip will cost roughly $1200 - $1700 including flights, hotels, souvenirs, etc.
The cost of Yosemite will be around the same maybe a bit less because we won't be spending any on hotels or restaurant food, we will just be camping the whole week in Yosemite. 

With these two options, which would you choose and why?
Again, we do want to swim and possibly fish, so if you have been to either park in late September/early October, how was the water?

If you recommend one park over the other, which campground(s) is/are your favorite?",2025-04-05 02:10:47,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,2,22,,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jrsynp/grand_canyon_or_yosemite/,MadLilChild

1jqv4ow,reddit,Thoughts on this Itinerary for 14 days in Peru?,"Hi everyone,

I'm going to Peru in the fall for 14 days, and I have a bad habit of overestimating how much I can do in a day. I'm hoping to get some opinions on my itinerary so I can go at a much more reasonable and less frantic pace.

I have to mention that I sit at a desk all day, so when I go on vacation, I walk a lot (ex., 30k steps a day). I'm not a lay-on-the-beach vacationer; I just don't want to overwhelm myself with too much sightseeing per day. Does that make sense?

**So here it goes:**  
Day 1–3: Land in Lima, Fly to Cusco

Day 4: Rainbow Mountain

Day 5-7: Explore Sacred Valley on the way to Ollantaytambo

Day 8–11: Inca Trail, Return to Cusco

Day 12: Another small day hike??

Day 13–14: Fly back to Lima, explore Lima

Day 15: Fly home in the morning

At some point, I thought I could squeeze in Arequipa and the Colca Canyon, but I felt I was overdoing it.

Im coming to the Philippines for 15 nights April/May.
Its our third trip to the Philippines, we've already been to Palawan and Siargao.

Initial plan was 9 nights Siquijor and 6 nights Panglao/Bohol, but i'm starting to consider splitting the trip into three 5-day stays on different Islands.

If we decided to do that, what would be your recommendation, where to go?
We absolutely loved Port Barton and its laid-back vibe, General Luna was exciting (we loved live-music bar-hopping every evening and the big choice of daytime activities), and I'd say El Nido was the worst of the above (too crowded).

Is there any other nearby destination that we could add to our plan? We are not much into snorkelling and hiking (that's why we skipped Coron), we enjoy island/beach hopping, so basically looking for a beach vacation with some good vibe, music and food options for the evening. Boracay and resort-ish vacation is not our style. I like to keep in simple, basic beach bungalows are my favourite 🫶🏼

1jpy2b8,reddit,Help planning a trip to Italy!,"Itinerary


Hi! I’m planning a solo trip for 2.5 weeks to Italy August 25th to September 11 starting in Rome. I have a rough Itinerary of cites i want to visit but open to any suggestions.

A little bit about me and my  interests -- this is my first time in Italy so I’d love to hit some of the major tourist attractions while I’m here ie Pisa, Colosseum, Duomo, Lake Como, etc.

Im a huge foody! This is one of the main reasons for my trip. Definitely looking for unique and authentic restaurants or street vendors that aren't too tourist trappy. I’d love to eat like the locals do. My price point is flexible, I’d like to keep it around $$ but could sneak in a few $$$$/michelin star experiences if highly recommended.

As much as i love the city, i also really enjoy being outdoors, historical sites, museums,in the countryside, or on a beach somewhere. I’m thinking that we'll stay in the cities as our home base and travel around the nearby area if i want to do any hiking, wine trips, coastal beach towns etc. I definitely want to see Lake Como and potentially go out to see the Dolomites. Is this a good strategy?

As for domestic travel, to bounce between city to city, i was thinking of purchasing a Eurail One Country Pass for Italy. Is this worth it or should i consider another form of travel? Also, not sure if this pass includes sleeper trains and I’d like really like to save daylight by leveraging sleeper trains to get from one place to another.

Lastly, for accommodations, I was thinking of using AirBnB or hotels for the entire stay across the country.

This is my itinerary at the moment

Flying landing into Rome on the 25th (5 nights)
Amalfi Coast (4 nights)
With a day drip to Pompeii
Florence (2-3 nights)
Venice (2-3 nights)
I’m flying out of Rome
Only thing missing is Sicily or Athens Greece :(.        which I really want to sneak in. For Sicily (thinking Palermo and/or Catania) 
Ideally, I'd like to have everything booked and reserved before i get out there.

Some questions and additional notes for you all:

Do you see any fat on the itinerary I should trim? Or do you think I am overcrowding things?
Any useful tip and tricks we should know about Italy?
Food and attraction recommendations are welcome :)

We really love exploring historical sites and museums, visiting beautiful towns, drinking good wine + food, hiking and relaxing on the beach. So both options are obviously very appealing!  

Our concerns for both are - 

Provence: we're concerned it could be too sleepy? we're young and enjoy going out (but also we aren't trying to go clubbing lol) 

Riviera: we're worried it'll be crawling with tourists in a way that feels very unenjoyable and it's also just a very expensive place to be! we are not dead set on staying in eze either, all of the towns in the area seem gorgeous.

I'm confused why they sent me a link to mail physical documents to Taiwan and there doesn't seem to be any online system like Japan and Singapore has.

1joke4f,reddit,This might be the first time I'm traveling without camping gear! So excited for my Italy/Dolomiti trip + questions,"Detailed itinerary below but the second half of our 2 and a half weeks trip will be dedicated to hiking the Alta via 1. End of July/early August. My SO and I learned that we were supposed to book our rifugios in January...at about the time we were starting to look at rifugios bookings 😅 By some miracle, I swear, we finally managed to book all of our rifugios this weekend except 2, we'll keep looking. Couldn't find anything the weekend before that. I'm super duper grateful, otherwise it would have been complicated to do this hike. I'm so excited to not have to carry around an enormous backpack in the scorching sun, and eat boring shelf stable food every night, for once!!!! (I adore camping, but we do a lot of that already, we were totally in for a light-carry hiking trip) 

I will have a few questions on different subjects at the end, if you can help me out with the few things I still struggle to figure out! 

And as usual I'm always open and looking for your amazing recommendations on spots we shouldn't miss out :) 

We are landing in Rome in the morning and that first day we might not do much or at least we gave ourselves a ""chilling"" day just in case. Probs for browsing around the cafes and restaurants. Second day Coloseum, Crypts/catacombs. 
Third day we bus to Naples to visit Pompei, and Herculanum if we find the time.
We spend the night in Naples and the next day we're going for a day trip to Capri island for sightseeing, walking around and check out the Garden of Augustus. And some beach time too. Ferry lin the evening of this fourth day and back to Naples. 

From Naples we will take the train in the morning of day 5 to Florence. Spend the night and most of the next day there, but we'll be taking a train in the PM to reach Venice around dinner. We have a looooovely airbnb right on the island of Venice, little terrace with a view, can you even believe it was less expensive than the hostel we were first going for in Mestre !! Two nights booked in Venice, visiting days 7 and most of 8. 

Day 8 is still a bit blurry as we are waiting for a rifugio to become available at the very first stop on our Dolomiti hike ; either we find one and therefore leave Venice late in the day to spend the night in Belluno, or we might start the hike a day after and instead do a huge stretch to reach our first booked rifugio in a single day (about 10hours from trail head) 😬
Anyway, if all goes according to plan, on day 9 we should begin 

~Alta via 1 of the Dolomiti~
We're doing it backwards from Belluno ! It's what made the most sense for us. 

We are hiking for day 9 (working on Bianchet/Pian de Fontana/Pramperet still..) , 10 (to Carestiato), 11 (Coldai), 12 (Passo Stolanza), 13 (still working on Passo Giau..) ,14 (Dibona) and on day 15th we'll most likely have to do a biiiiig stretch from Rif Dibona (close to the road to Cortina D'ampezzo, near/before? Lagazuoi) to rif Pederu in a single day (10hrs?), to catch a night bus going to Rome (at least we hope to find one!) 
This is because we are really at the end of our trip and are coming short on time, flying from Rome to home in Canada (not without a layover, of course! Shrugs at my partner's attempt to save 100 ish bucks) in early afternoon on day 17th. 

So we unfortunately won't be hiking the last little stretch to Braies, but I think it will be more than enough to amaze us! I'm honestly jumping around just thinking about this adventure.

But if I may inquire to anyone who would happen to know...
1- We accidentally booked only a single bed / spot in Carestiato, when we thought it was available for 2! I booked it anyway and we really need that spot, nothing else  around...from experience do you think it will be fine if we show up and if there are no more beds, we ask to sleep in the same bed?(we're both very lean so not the best but better than the floor lol) Most importantly, will both of us get dinner , or is everything calculated tightly? 

2-I've never driven outside of my country(province, actually), a bit nervous to do so. But if I were to rent a car let's say near rifugio Pederu, or in Cortina D'ampezzo, can I drive to Rome and..leave it there? How do these things work? Would it be crazy expensive? Or even almost dangerous for that route length if I'm inexperienced with European roads? 

3- please let me know about your favorite local-owned and low key/mooost authentic restaurants in Rome, Naples, Florences
 and Venice ! As well as little known spots easy to miss out on that we can add to our bucket list. We don't have a big food budget at this point, but we could indulge on something more fancy for one or two nights out of the trip, though. And we love more rustic spots too.

1jofeja,reddit,Stuck between two bags for important items during travel. Which is safer?,"Hello! 

I leave for Italy in two weeks and while I do not think Italy is dangerous, I will be traveling a lot during this trip (Three big train stations) and I plan on investing a good quality bag since I will be traveling more internationally after this trip. I'm going to carry important documents in this bag such as my phone, passport, wallet, film camera, and medication.  I'm currently stuck between two bags.

[Option one](https://www.patagonia.com/product/terravia-mini-hip-pack-1-liter/49448.html?dwvar_49448_color=SMDB)

Pros

* Will fit everything minus camera (girlfriend has one where I tested this out)
* Cheaper
* Can swing bag around in the front and have easy view of everything

Cons

* Smaller
* Has clasp that can easily be snapped off

[Option two](https://www.patagonia.com/product/atom-sling-bag-8-liters/48262.html?dwvar_48262_color=SLPU)

Pros 

* Can fit everything plus camera, plus anything else I buy while on the street
* No clasp
* Zippers has loop that can put carabiner to reduce chance of picketpocket

Cons

* No front view (unsure if feels comfortable if swinging to the front) probably the biggest case against it 
* More expensive and takes up more space",2025-03-31 21:58:01,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,1,22,,0.55,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jofeja/stuck_between_two_bags_for_important_items_during/,thenorthremembers110

1job5i4,reddit,USA Road trip advice,"Hi, we are planning to do a road trip in the US, going from San Francisco to Yellowstone, with a duration of approximately three weeks. The thing is that we have some doubts, because it is a really long trip, and we are not sure if it is going to be too much road, or if there will be days where we are going to see a whole lot of nothing. 

We were planning on doing stops at least in las vegas and bryce/zion parks.

Do you consider the itinerary feasible/reasonable? After Yellowstone, which airport would be best for a flight back to Europe? I was thinking maybe Denver or Seattle, but both of them seem to be really far away from Yellowstone. 

And last, do you consider this a good trip for foreign tourists in the US? I went to New York a few years ago, but I assume this is quite different.

Edit:

Thanks for all the advice! We didn't want to eliminate SF (we are already sacrificing things we liked, like Yosemite), but taking a flight from SF to LV is something we hadn't considered and it saves us a day. We are already looking into it.

Also, it looks like SLC is well conected, and being a bigger airport will probably lower the fee for leaving the car in a different airport. Besides, the ~5 hour drive from Yellowstone to SLC would be acceptable.

Our beaches you just park somewhere and walk up to it so that’s my only experience but I’m not looking to go to your typical beaches I guess you could say. It seems like the majority of the beaches I’d like to see are on the north shore in Minnesota and then what you see of the beaches from Chicago.

Hoping to get some advice on an upcoming week-long trip to Oaxaca in May. My husband and I are well-seasoned travelers excited to visit Oaxaca City for the markets, culture, art, and energy.

However, we have 7 nights and I’m wondering if this will be too much time in the city. I’d love to visit the beaches on the Pacific coast but I’m wary of losing two days to travel on such a short trip. I also don’t want to feel rushed during our time in the city. The general consensus among travelers asking the same questions is that a week is definitely not too long to explore the city and surrounding areas - do folks here agree? And if so, what are some potential day trips/surrounding areas to explore that don’t require a group tour? We are open to private guides but generally don’t enjoy group excursions. Is it advisable/safe to rent a car for a day or two to explore on our own?

1jo2eyh,reddit,Lost Luggage in Europe: How Does Compensation Work?,"Hello everyone!

I am Brazilian and just returned from a trip to Europe, but I had an issue with one of my checked bags.

On my last flight within Europe (Milan > Barcelona) with easyJet, one of my bags was lost. Still at Barcelona Airport (BCN), I spoke with easyJet and the airport staff, who searched for the bag but could not find it.

As a result, I filled out the Property Irregularity Report and am now waiting for updates from easyJet.

It has been six days, and I have not received any response (email or phone call).

I am not sure how it works in Europe, but in Brazil, I have experienced lost luggage before, and here, it is possible to take legal action and receive compensation for the inconvenience.

I had to spend the last three days of my trip wearing the same clothes. From what I researched, I could have bought clothes, and easyJet would have reimbursed me, but since it was the end of my trip, I didn’t have the chance. I arrived in Barcelona at night and was leaving for Brazil the next morning. When I arrived in São Paulo also at night, I only stayed at a hotel to sleep because I had another flight to my city early the next day, leaving no time to buy clothes.

So, I would like to understand how this works in Europe. From my research, most cases mention reimbursement for expenses due to lost luggage, but I haven’t seen anything about compensation for the loss of the bag itself.

Regarding travel insurance, I purchased one, and from what I’ve seen, I have to wait 21 days before I can file a claim for the lost bag.",2025-03-31 12:50:20,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,2,6,,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jo2eyh/lost_luggage_in_europe_how_does_compensation_work/,Individual-Cut3998

However, whenever we have a long-haul flight, I have a good experience with breaking it up and adding an extra stop (number of days TBD).

Another consideration is New York (they say the city is beautiful in Autumn) and also visiting Sleepy Hollow, but it too is likely to have way too many visitors during that season.

* 🌳 **Baobab Avenue** (top priority!)
* 🏞️ **Tsingy de Bemaraha** (also a must for us)

We’d return to **Tana on May 8** and stay overnight for our Sainte-Marie flight the next morning.  
**May 1–2** would be used for a visit to **Andasibe National Park**, including a **night walk in the rainforest**.

# Option 2: Full Road Trip (May 1–8, no domestic flights)

Instead of flying, we’d do a **complete road trip by car with a driver**.  
This route is based on the places we’d love to see – but we’re unsure what’s realistically possible and would **really appreciate your honest feedback** or route adjustments!

# Wishlist (flexible):

* **Andasibe** (rainforest, night walk)
* **Ranomafana**
* **Isalo**
* **Baobab Avenue (Morondava)**
* (*Optional:* **Antsirabe**, if time allows)
* Tsingy probably wouldn’t fit in this version – and that’s okay

# Our current draft itinerary for Option 2:

|**Date**|**Route**|**Notes**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**May 1**|Tana → Andasibe|Afternoon: arrive & night walk |
|**May 2**|Andasibe → Ranomafana|Long drive day|
|**May 3**|Ranomafana NP|Full day hike|
|**May 4**|Ranomafana → Isalo|Long drive|
|**May 5**|Isalo NP|Hike & relax|
|**May 6**|Isalo → Morondava|Long drive|
|**May 7**|Baobab Avenue|Sunset 🌅|
|**May 8**|Morondava → Tana|Long drive |

We’re worried this **might be too rushed** – what do you think?  
Is it realistic or should we drop something? We want to **enjoy the experience**, not just check off places.

# Our open questions:

1. Is it **worth flying to Morondava just for Baobabs & Tsingy**, or would we miss out on more diverse nature experiences?
2. Is **Tsingy accessible in early May**, or still too muddy/slow?
3. Does **Option 2 seem realistic**, or too exhausting? What would you cut or change?
4. Would you include **Antsirabe** if time allows – or skip it entirely?
5. Are there **trusted agencies or driver recommendations** for a 7–8 day trip like this?
6. Is it risky to drive **back to Tana on May 8**, the day before our Sainte-Marie flight (May 9 at 09:00)?
7. We’re still deciding whether to fly back from Nosy Be on **May 22 or 23** (both arrive \~11 PM) – would you prioritize **more time on Nosy Be or more margin in Tana** before the international flight?

# After May 9:

* **May 9–13:** Île Sainte-Marie – flexible, no plans yet
* **May 13–23:** Nosy Be – relaxing, possibly diving and island hopping
* **May 22 or 23:** Back to Tana for final night(s)

Thanks so much for reading and for any thoughts or advice – we really want to make the most of this trip without burning out!

1jmuvx1,reddit,Alaska “Main Cabin” VS Jetblue “Blue”,"EDIT: I checked prices just now and JetBlue is now $50 less than Alaska. 

_____________________________

ORIGINAL POST:

It’s been over 5 years since I have traveled so I dont know what has changed. I have only ever flown on JetBlue and Southwest.

SEA - BOS

Jetblue is $100 more.

From my initial research, Alaska has no TV but you can connect your device to watch things. Also, meals or snacks have to be pre-ordered? Or are snacks included?

Does Jetblue still give snacks?

I have noticed that no airlines include checked luggage now unless you’re first class.

Are seat spacing the same between my two choices? I am small anyway so not much of an issue.

Thank you.

1jmup98,reddit,Uyuni Dalt Flats. Worrying about elevation and how to do tours,"We're currently in San  Pedro de Atacama and want to go to Bolivia, Uyuni next. I know there's tours that start in San Pedro and end in Uyuni but I've heard and read that the elevation gain is quite extreme and then you're stuck with altitude sickness while on the tour. So we're thinking about taking a Bus to Uyuni first, acclimatise there for two, maybe three days (I know there isn't much else to do there, we would just chill and rest) and then do a tour from there. So a 3D2N tour from Uyuni that also ends in Uyuni. 

Has anyone experience with either one of these routes and can share some insights? Is my plan sensible or is it stupid because you end up driving a lot more that you have to?

Thank you in advance!

I was talking with my friend and she said she had a 6 hour layover in Vancouver and they wouldn’t let her leave. I can see that not being a good idea considering the short timing but can they straight tell you no? Also, I am Canadian which I’ve read gives me visa on arrival but my parter will need to apply for a visa in advance… I wondered if this short time frame would cause struggles.

You can visit Singapore without a visa for tourism or business. The [Immigration and Checkpoints Authority](https://www.ica.gov.sg/) decides who can enter Singapore and how long they can stay. The period of stay permitted is at the discretion of the immigration officer. It is normally between 14 and 30 days for British citizens.

1jmnnen,reddit,Uzbekistan & Kyrgyzstan Itinerary - Tour Questions for Kyrg,"Planning a trip to Uzbekistan & Kyrgyzstan in late April/early May (wish it was later to do some serious hiking in Kyrg, but these are the dates we have). We are very into history, but slightly more-so into nature and outdoor experiences. 

My questions:

1. Should we attribute more time to Uzbekistan? 

2. Should we hire a driver/set tour for Kyrgyzstan? We have **never**  done a long multi-day tour like this, but am hesitant to rent my own vehicle and drive over mountain passes with it not being summer. Also hesitant to do a 14 day tour in case we don't love our guide, company, etc. so was going to break it up into a couple different tours. 

3. Any must-see cities/experiences we're missing in either country? 

Planning on this itinerary for Uzbekistan:

4/15 - 4/18 = Samarkand

4/18 - 4/20 = Bukhara

4/20 - 4/22 = Khiva

4/22 - 4/24 = Tashkent

1jmn6rz,reddit,Advice on Chile Trip Itenerary,"Hi everyone:

I was hoping for some advice on a Chile trip itinerary. We arrive 7 am May 15 and leave 8 pm May 25 so basically 9 full days and 2 half days. Based on your comments we have decided to drop TDP (not enough time and not enough daylight time, weather) and have decided to focus on Rapa Nui and Atacama this trip (hoping there will be more in the future). Here is the tentative itinerary.

Day 1, 15th: Land in SCL 7 am, relax, see some of the city later on in the day

Day 2, 16th fly to Calama CJC Leave SCL 9 am, reach CJC 1130 am

Stay 16, 17, 18 nights Atacama area so 2 full days

Day 5, 19th fly back to SCL, leave CJC 10 am, reach SCL 1230 pm, spend time in Santiago pm

Day 6 20th fly to Rapa Nui IPC, leave SCL 11 am, reach IPC 230 pm

Stay 20, 21, 22, 23 nights on Rapa Nui so 3 full days

Day 10, 24th fly to Santiago, leave IPC at 230 pm, reach SCL at 9 pm

Day 11, 25th, spend am to early pm in Santiago, leave SCL at 8 pm for return

We had wanted to do to Inca lagoon but that would require one full extra day. Would anyone advise shortening one day in Atacama or Easter Island to make that happen? Or is it not worth it?

1jm6thk,reddit,Thinking of going to Aruba! Any thoughts or other Caribbean recs?,"Hey y’all! So I (29M) had surgery about three weeks ago, and I’m doing fine now. My surgeon cleared me to travel, swim, soak in water, all that good stuff. I’m off work for the next two months, so I really want to get away and just leave LA for a bit and chill somewhere different.

I’ve been thinking about the Caribbean. For some context, I’ve been to a few islands before. My boyfriend (25M) though has never traveled internationally. He’s been to Hawaii and loved it, especially the food, but he’s not really a swimming in the beach kind of person. I’m not much of a swimmer either, but I love being near the ocean: waking up, sitting under a palapa, sipping a drink, watching the sunrise and sunset, waves in the background. That kind of vibe.

I’m basically still recovering, so I’m looking for something really relaxing. Not super active or busy. Just sun, quiet, and nice scenery.

A little background: I’ve traveled to over 50 countries, mostly in the Middle East and Africa. So while I’m not new to travel at all, the Caribbean isn’t somewhere I’ve explored as much. The last time I went was about two years ago, so planning a beach trip like this honestly feels a little rusty for me. I’m kind of re-diving into it, and realizing that planning a Caribbean trip is a whole different mindset.

Places I’ve been and liked:
- Turks and Caicos: Loved it. White sand, clear water, super chill hotel-focused vacation.
- Roatán: Also amazing. Beautiful beaches, great food, amazing snorkeling culture fun nightlife.
- Puerto Rico: Amazing food, but it felt a bit too much like Miami with the crowd and social scene.
- Bahamas: Not really my vibe. It felt very party-heavy and packed. But, full disclosure, I stayed in Nassau.
- Colombia (Caribbean side): Cool to visit, but again, very catered to tourists.

We were thinking about Belize at first, but from what I’ve seen online, the beach scene didn’t seem as relaxing or picturesque as I expected. Where are the sands?? lol

Now we’re looking at Aruba. It seems promising with lots of hotel options along the strip, great and beautiful beaches, access to good food, and it looks pretty easy to get around. We’re planning to rent a car, but it also looks super walkable near Eagle and Palm Beach, which I like. I don’t like being stuck in a hotel the whole time, so having things nearby is a plus.

Just wondering if anyone here has thoughts on Aruba or other suggestions for Caribbean destinations that are chill, beautiful, and not super crowded, but still accessible enough for someone like my partner who’s never left the country before.

We’re planning to go in the next month or so. Appreciate any input!

1jm43g8,reddit,Lake Atitlan where to stay for 2 women in their 30s,"Hey All! 

I have been down the rabbit hole on here and trip advisor and I can’t seem to nail down the best place for us. So I figured I would just ask directly with a little more info and see if someone can help. 

My friend and I are going to Lake Atitlan at the end of the month. We are both in our mid-30s. So our parting days are behind us, but we will enjoy a couple drinks after dinner. And likely call it a night around 10ish. 

We are only spending 3 days so we want to pick one area to stay and stick with it as our home base. 

Originally we thought for just 3 days, perhaps panajachel, but we think it will be too touristy and busy. We are seasoned travelers and like to avoid main tourist hubs for more than maybe half a day. 

The more we read we thought San Pedro may fit the bill then. We still want to be able to walk around and get water taxis to other places easily. But about every hotel review has a bunch of reviews saying something along the lines of “the music from the bars outside was so loud and unbearable.” And as we no longer party, this concerns us. 

Santa Cruz seems the most up our alley as far as the hotels and quieter/simpler and a bit more in nature, but it seems maybe a bit too quiet. Everything I’ve read seems to agree, if it’s your first time and want to walk around at all or pop around to other areas, this isn’t the place for you. Seems everyone who stays in Santa Cruz just stays there and relaxes.

1jlsqq4,reddit,New Zealand Help!,"Hello there, I would like some advice for my upcoming New Zealand trip please!

Some background: My wife and I (early 30s, not avid hikers but can do light and short 2-3h+ trails with little elevation. I love wine, she doesn't drink. we love food!) went on our honeymoon to NZ last April-May and are so enamoured of the country that we are already planning a trip back this late November - early December, specially to see the lupins (yes, I know they are an invasive weed). Perhaps also cover some easy tracks that were closed last time out.

On last year's trip, we covered in the South: Queenstown, Te Anau, Milford Sound, Wanaka, Hawea, Mount Cook, Tekapo and Christchurch. We are not averse to seeing the same stuff (hence Mackenzie Basin again for the lupins), but are open to new things as well.

May I please ask for you to provide feedback on my itinerary below and any recommendations. 

Day 1: Land in Chch, overnight Chch.

Day 2: Drive to Hokitika via Arthur's Pass. Overnight Hokitika

Day 3: Explore around Hokitika - Pancake Rocks, Truman Track, Hokitika Gorge etc.

Day 4: Hokitka to Franz Josef / Fox Glacier.

Day 5: Glaciers

Day 6: Glaciers to Wanaka

Day 7: Wanaka - Rob Roy Glacier Track - please be open this time! Lavender Farm.

\*Day 8: Wanaka to Mount Cook

Day 9: Mount Cook - Kea Point, maybe explore some other tracks apart from Hooker Valley

Day 10: Mount Cook to Tekapo

Day 11: Tekapo - Mount John

Day 12: Tekapo to Christchurch, return car and fly home



\*I have one major dilemma as it stands - should I take an extra 3 days, starting from Day 8, to go from Wanaka -> 1N at Owaka/Curio Bay (\~4h) -> 2N at Dunedin (\~2h drive) -> Mount Cook (\~3.5h), to have a chance at exploring part of the south east (and hopefully spot some seals and sea lions) as well? This will increase the trip length to 14 days, as I look at cutting day 11 at Tekapo should I make this change.

Thank you so much, all!

Very much looking forward to be back.",2025-03-28 11:20:35,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,2,6,,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jlsqq4/new_zealand_help/,Newbshuffler
1jlrlht,reddit,Luggage forwarding in Japan,"Hello everyone,

How exactly does luggage forwarding work in Japan?

My wife and I will each have one large suitcase. During our trip, there will be two occasions when we want to explore the city in the morning/afternoon before traveling to our next destination later in the day. By that time, we will have already checked out and, of course, don’t want to carry around two large suitcases.

Specifically, this will happen once when traveling from Okayama to Kobe, as we plan to stop in Himeji to visit the castle. So, we’ll take the Shinkansen in the morning, stop in Himeji, and arrive in Kobe in the evening to check in at our Airbnb.

The second instance will be when traveling from Kyoto to Osaka. We want to explore Kyoto in the morning/afternoon and then travel to Osaka later in the day to check into our Airbnb.

Is it possible to send the suitcases in the morning (from Okayama and Kyoto) and pick them up at the station in the evening (Kobe and Osaka)? Or are they delivered directly to the accommodation?

Since we're staying in an Airbnb, there won’t be anyone available to receive the luggage.

I have nearly 4 days (3 nights) in [Lima](https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Tourism-g294316-Lima_Lima_Region-Vacations.html) and am thinking of doing a day trip to Paracas. It seems like several companies offer day-trips leaving early from Lima and returning late. Itinerary options include a morning boat ride to the Ballestas Islands paired with either a trip to Huacachina to ride dune buggies and see sand dunes at sunset, or doing the Golden Shadows / Sunset trek in Paracas National Reserve.

Which would be the better option -- Huacachina vs. Paracas National Reserve?

She had a doctor's appointment yesterday, and he switched her antibiotics, so the condition (which is not serious) is considered unstable, so they can't offer coverage. On top of that, Holter monitor results from March 11 are still not available, so since diagnosis is pending for this separate issue, she is ineligible for coverage for all conditions.

Does anyone know of any coverage options/insurance providers for a pre-existing, unstable condition and a medical test pending results? I am waiting to hear back on high-risk coverage options.

1k70acy,reddit,Solo PhD Break Adventure: New Zealand Rough Sketch – Feedback Wanted!,"Heyyoo,  

I’m planning a 12 day solo trip to New Zealand from Christchurch to Auckland after my first year of a US PhD and would love your feedback on timing, must-see spots, and especially your favorite campsites (Google pins or maps welcome!). I have a campervan that is stocked im renting. I am supposed to start in one city and end in the other. I’m big into trail running, climbing, and Māori culture—so if you’d drop or add anything for those, let me know!

Here’s my rough itinerary:

Christchurch to Lake Tekapo/Mt Cook  
- Drive: 3 hours  
- Stay: 3 nights  
- Explore Lake Tekapo, Lake Pukaki, day trip to Mount Cook for hiking.

Lake Tekapo to Abel Tasman (via Kaikoura or Nelson NP)  
- Drive: 8–9 hours (split over 2 days)  
- Day 1: Tekapo to Kaikoura (5–6 hours), overnight in Kaikoura  
- Day 2: Kaikoura to Abel Tasman (3 hours)  
- Stay: 3–4 nights  
- Hike, chill on beaches, explore Abel Tasman.

Abel Tasman to Picton (Ferry Terminal)  
- Drive: 2–3 hours  
- Ferry to Wellington: 3.5 hours  
- Stay: 1 night in Wellington.

Wellington to Taranaki (New Plymouth)  
- Drive: 4.5 hours  
- Stay: 3 nights  
- Hike Mt Taranaki (Pouakai Crossing or Circuit), Pukekura Park, coastal walkway, local art.

Taranaki to Tongariro National Park  
- Drive: 3–3.5 hours  
- Stay: 2 nights  
- Hike Tongariro Alpine Crossing.

Tongariro to Hobbiton (or skip to Auckland)  
- Drive: 2.5–3 hours  
- Book Hobbiton tour.

Hobbiton to Auckland (Airport or city)  
- Drive: 2 hours  
- Stay final night near Auckland/airport.

Food tips welcome too! I’m excited to try local specialties if you recommend. Any favorite spots or hidden gems for these or other must-try Kiwi foods? Also keen on quick, tasty road trip eats and local treats to fuel my adventures.

Also, I want to deeply connect with Māori culture and spirituality, especially their relationship with nature. I’m fascinated by stories of Kupe and want to learn about concepts like kaitiakitanga (guardianship), mauri (life force), wairua (spirit), mana (spiritual power), and tapu (sacredness). If you know good cultural tours, guided hikes, or places where I can respectfully experience Māori stories, rituals, or spiritual sites, please share! I’m eager to understand how Māori see humans as part of the natural world, not separate from it, and how this shapes their environmental stewardship.

Questions for you:  
- Is this timing realistic for an active traveler?  
- What are your best campsites or hut stays along this route? Please share Google pins!  
- If you love ultra running, climbing, or extreme sports, what would you drop or add?  
- Any “don’t miss” day hikes, trail runs, or adventure activities beyond what’s listed?  
- Favorite local foods or eateries to hit up on the way?  
- Recommendations for authentic Māori cultural experiences or spiritual sites?

Some things I’m considering:  
- More time in Queenstown/Wanaka for adventure sports? (worth the detour?)  
- Ultra/trail running in Rotorua or Tongariro? (Tarawera Ultra, Tongariro Northern Circuit)

Why I'm Posting: Hoping for some direction and recommendations from people familiar with the Front Range. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by the sheer amount of possibilities for hikes & outdoor adventures and trying to determine what may or may not be accessible in early May, as it looks like some of the scenic roads or access to trailheads won't reopen for the season until June. 

Background: My girlfriend and I are traveling from Philadelphia for a concert (Turnover) at Red Rocks on Friday (5/2) and staying in RiNo until Sunday morning to explore the city a bit (we're all set on recommendations for Denver). We plan to leave Denver on Sunday morning for a day trip to Golden or Colorado Springs, then spend Monday - Wednesday morning working remotely from Boulder, and then take the remainder of the week off to stay somewhere further into the mountains to hike and look for other fun things to do. 

Sunday Night -> Wednesday Morning - Remote work from Boulder on East Coast hours. We picked Boulder because we assumed we'd have easy and reliable access to wifi and cell service needed for work but can almost immediately be on trails by 4pm each day that we can complete before dark. Have been recommended Royal Arch, Mount Sanitas, Chautauqua Park, Flatirons.

Wednesday -> Saturday Morning - This is where we need the most help! We're wondering what would be the best mountain town to stay in thats less than 2 hours from Denver and would have access to hikes and scenic drives that are accessible this time of year. She's really into trains and wants to do an ATV tour, so any guidance on that would be great too! Based on what we've read online, we've heard Nederland, Black Hawk, or Idaho Springs could be good options for an AirBnB. 

About Us: We are in our 30s, fairly experienced with hiking in the Northeast/New England but won't have snowshoes/spikes and she really isn't into hiking in snow much deeper than typical hiking boots can handle. We head back to the airport on Saturday 5/10. We'll have a rental truck/SUV with 4WD/AWD (not sure what model we'll end up with).

i got a redress number a few weeks ago and i wanted to know how they work? i booked an upcoming flight from Toronto to NYC for 12 days through expedia. i entered my redress number there, as well as on the Delta app. i also have a print out copy of the letter i received from the DHS. is there anything else i need to do? 

i am also curious how likely this redress number will work given my situation but i suppose it all depends on the officer you get.

We are planning a trip in southern France and have 7 days to spend on beaches to the east of Marseille. We are currently looking at doing the following:
Cassis – 1 night
Saint Tropez – 1 night
Antibes – 2 nights
Nice – 3 nights (Eze, Menton etc)

Whilst the above may feel rushed in moving places, we need to split our journey as we are riding a motorbike.

Is there anywhere between Saint Tropez and Antibes we should be spending a night at instead of two nights in Antibes?

Any other beaches we must see?

We will only be going to public beaches and not interested in beach bars / paying for umbrellas / sunbeds if that makes a difference.

1k6637h,reddit,Hainan Airlines Luggage Delay,"Hello all
We are looking for advice on how to proceed with delayed luggage after a flight with Hainan Airlines.
Me and my Girlfriend recently took a flight from Tokio to México City.

Tokyo-Beijing-Tijuana- México City
(April 14 HU440-HU7925)

One of our backpacks did not arrive at México City with our Flight.
On saturday April 19 our luggage appeared to have arrived in MÉX.
Over the last week we tried to get Hainan Airlines to deliver our luggage to our final destination which is Queretaro.
They denied all our request by saying:

>We understand that your baggage did not arrive with you on the same flight, and you had to pick it up yourself
 >in Mexico. We apologize for any inconvenience caused this issue. After contacting the Beijing airport, we were informed that your baggage did not >arrive due to security checks at the Beijing airport. As this situation is beyond our control is not the responsibility
 >of the airline, we regret to inform you that we are unable to deliver your baggage to the address you have specified. We hope you understand this >situation. Once again, we apologize for any inconvenience caused by this matter.

We did not have to recheck our bags in Beijing as the Tokyo-Beijing Flight was also done by Hainan Airlines.
We think that it is the Airlines responsibility to make sure our luggage reaches is after a delay that is beyond MY control.
Going there to pick the luggage up myself would cost me a mínimum of 7 hours traveltime and ~50$.

Every other airline I ever has this happen with (Lufthansa,KLM) did not hesitate to transfer my luggage to my destination even if its >3hrs away from the AirPort. I got it lates 2-3 days after the flight.
As Hainan Airlines does not have an official Office in México, we can not go after them with PROFECO (their Words)
I am a european citizen, I was also the one that bought the tickets. I bought the tickets while I was in Korea tho.
Can I pressure them with European Consumer Protection? 

I really dont wanna make the journey and lose a day as I am pretty busy, but I also dont want to lose my luggage.

Any advice that some of you can give?
Any experiencias with Hainan Airlines¿

1k640zx,reddit,🌍 Seeking Advice: B1/B2 Visa Interview After ESTA Denial — Dutch Citizen with Afghan Background,"
I’d really appreciate any insights or advice you can share based on your experience. Here’s my situation:

I applied for a B1/B2 visa in May 2023 at the U.S. Embassy in Amsterdam. At the time, I was a permanent resident of the Netherlands and held an Afghan passport. Unfortunately, my visa was denied under Section 214(b).

In December 2023, I became a Dutch citizen and received my Dutch passport. In March 2025, I applied for ESTA — but after five days of pending status, it was denied. I was then advised to apply for a B1/B2 visa again and attend an in-person interview.

I’m now preparing for that process — gathering all the required documents and mentally getting ready for the interview. For context:
	
•	My entire immediate family (parents and siblings) lives in the U.S.
	
•	I have documentation of my father’s cancer diagnosis, and one of my primary reasons for travel is to visit and spend time with him.
	
•	I live in the Netherlands with my husband (also Dutch, Afghan-born) and our three children, all born here.
	
•	This trip is strictly for personal/family reasons — I have no intention to overstay or violate visa terms.

If anyone here has had a similar experience (ESTA denial followed by a B1/B2 application), especially with a background like mine, I’d be really grateful to hear your insights:
	
•	What kinds of questions did they ask you during the interview?
	
•	What supporting documents did you bring?
	
•	Any tips to strengthen my case or avoid common mistakes?

1k5oo9i,reddit,Seeking advice on trip with gf to west coast USA during June,"Apologies if this isn't formatted correctly for this subreddit. First real Reddit post. Please bear with me.  
  
Over the past few years, my girlfriend and I have been fortunate enough to do quite a bit of travel independently, be it for work, or for visiting family, or friends we haven't seen in a while. We haven't done much travel together, however, and have been waiting for a good moment to do a proper trip together for a change.

We both need to be in California this summer for a wedding (mid-june, near SFO), so we're thinking this is a perfect chance to make a trip out of it. We're spinning out though, as neither of us have spent much time on the west coast at all, and there's too many places to see that we just can't put together a coherent itinerary.

We both have our eyes on Seattle as a potential place to move, and have some friends there that we can stay with for a few days, so we're basing our trip off the assumption that we'll either start or end there.

But we're stuck idling - we want to see the Redwood forests, and Napa, and the beaches south of San Fran, and the Oregon coastline, and Portland, and Mt. Rainier, and the islands just west of Seattle, and Yosemite. Can't possibly do all of that, and I'm sure we're just touching the surface. Also there's Vancouver. Thing is too - it seems that we'll definitely need a car for much of the above, and that's fine, but I don't think we want to go full road-trip, instead focusing on quality time spent in a handful (or even just two) places. We'd love to do as much as we can, but we'd also like to have at least a period of 3 days where we stay still and relax. Something that piqued our interest was the mention of an Amtrak line from SFO > SEA here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/ukfrs4/anyone\_have\_a\_west\_coast\_itinerary\_washington/](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/ukfrs4/anyone_have_a_west_coast_itinerary_washington/)

Could anyone point us in the right direction? Should we go north or south from San Fran? Should we consider multi-city flights, and road trip between the source/destinations? I have seen the post linked in the FAQ on a road trip between san fran to seattle (https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/rr6za/seattle\_to\_san\_francisco\_coastal\_road\_trip/), but it is 13 years old and assume it is quite dated, and as previously stated, we may not be equipped to commit to a full-on road trip.

Is it even really practical to try to do more than stay in SFO for a few extra days, then fly to Seattle for a few others?

Some ideas we've had:

1. SFO > Redwood > Portland > Seattle > home
   1. Fly to SFO for wedding and rent a car
   2. Stay 2-3 nights in Napa or Sonoma or somewhere else nearby (relax time)
   3. Drive up 5 hrs to Redwood and stay a night
   4. Drive up from there to Portland for another night or two
   5. Drive up to Seattle and spend 4-5 days in city
   6. Fly Seattle > home
2. SFO > Seattle > home
   1. Fly to SFO for wedding
   2. Leave immediately post-wedding and go to Seattle
   3. Stay with friends in city for a few days
   4. Ferry to San Juan islands and stay at a lodge for a couple days (relax time)
3. San Luis Bispo > SFO >Seattle > home
   1. Fly to San Luis Bispo and travel to beach-y places like Cambria and Big Sur, Monterey, etc
   2. Realizing California is a big place... Stopping list here.

rrrrrgggg. Planning not my strong suit.

Budget between the two of us is no higher than $5k if possible.

We booked a camper van and will be driving through Northern Namibia, then into Botswana, looping back through Southern Namibia on our way back to Windhoek.   
We are planning to do safaris (land and river), hot air balloon tours, hiking, and sight seeing. We are a very outdoorsy group from the pnw so we are not strangers to the outdoors and actually prefer to have a nature-centred trip.

Thank you in advance y'all <3

|:-|:-|:-|
|Day 1|Windhoek|Pick up vehicle, stash up on food|
|Day 2 - 3|Sossusvlei||
|Day 4|Swakopmund||
|Day 5|Splitzkoppe||
|Day 6 - 8|Botswana - Etosha National Park|See Brandenberg peak, Safari, hot air balloon ride|
|Day 9|Rundu|Boat safari, cultural immersion|

Medically necessary healthcare is defined as treatment that cannot reasonably wait until you return home. This includes: 
Emergency treatment and visits to A&E. 
Treatment for long-term or pre-existing medical conditions. 
Routine medical care for pre-existing conditions that need monitoring 
Routine maternity care (as long as you are not going abroad to give birth). Oxygen therapy and kidney dialysis (though some treatments may need pre-arranging).

Hi everyone!

I’ve thoroughly confused myself trying to plan a quick Switzerland trip and would love some help. I’ll be traveling with my parents (all adults, ages 25–55) from Australia — it’s our first time in Europe.

We’ll be leaving from Milan on either May 26 or 27 (flexible depending on what works best), and I want to spend 1, maybe 2 nights in Switzerland.

Originally, I was really keen on Grindelwald for the cable cars and the toboggan experience. But transport from Milan + accommodation in Grindelwald is turning out to be quite expensive.

I then looked at staying in Zurich instead, but the train journey is still pricey, and I feel like we might miss the classic mountain experience.

I also considered renting a car (my dad’s a confident driver), but I’m unsure how easy it is to drive and park in Grindelwald or other villages in the Jungfrau region.

Then I came across the Bernina Express, which looks amazing for scenic views — but then we’d miss out on the cable cars and alpine village feel.

To make things more confusing, I just listened to a podcast that mentioned lots of lesser-known villages in the Jungfrau region also have cable cars and scenic train access, and may be more peaceful (and maybe more affordable?). They suggested staying in Lauterbrunnen and taking cable cars, trains and/or busses to the nearby villages.

At this point, I’m just overwhelmed! We want a scenic Swiss experience, something iconic with a cable car or mountain view, ideally without breaking the bank. Would love any advice — suggested routes, places to stay, or even if it’s better to do something totally different!

* **Has anyone managed to board an earlier descent train if they had a later return ticket?** Is there standby flexibility or is it strict?
* Would it have been better to book a return around 2:30–3:00 PM instead?

1k3tjjx,reddit,"Nice to Paris: flight, train, or bus?","Hi all would love some advice! 

I have an overseas flight from Paris ORLY to the States at 11:30AM on June 5. I need to get from Nice to Paris, and I’ve looked at trains, flights, and buses, and I’m conflicted about what to do. 

Flight: Easyjet 6:30 —> 8:00 AM. This is what I’m leaning towards because it takes me directly to the same airport. 3.5 hours should be enough time since I’m not checking in any bags. 

Train+bus: there’s a train+bus option that departs at 5pm the previous day and arrives at ORLY at 5:30AM June 5. Since it’s overnight, it can save me one night’s accommodation. However, I’m a little hesitant about changing from train to bus in the middle of the night, and I’m a young solo female traveler too. I also have a long international flight ahead, so I’m not thrilled about having a 24+ hour travel day.

Train: Or should I be extra cautious, get to Paris the previous day at 9PM and book accommodations? I don’t love this option because I’m pretty much wasting a day, and I’ll need to spend more on accommodations. 

So again, I’m leaning towards flying with Easyjet. Does anyone have experience with Easyjet? From my quick search, they do seem pretty reliable, and it’s an early flight. I’m just worried delays might happen. 

I’ve been going in circles the past couple days trying to decide what to do, so I’m finally posting. Any advice or commentary is appreciated!

I am currently in Peru and want to do a trip to the Amazon. Currently looking at minimum of a 4 night/5 day trip, happy to do a day or two more if budget allows (probably max out around $1000). 

Our initial research suggested Iquitos. However we are currently in Cusco, so rather then fly to Lima, then up to Iquitos, then back to Lima (our flights out of Peru are booked from Lima), we are now tempted more by Manu National Park or Tambopata, due to their (relative) proximity.

We are experienced with trecking and are in good fitness, so somewhere less accessible would be ideal, because we don't want to be part of huge groups.

Shortly after my summer class ends on June 2nd, my family and I’d like to vacation. I suggested we go to a National Park, but my mom suggests we go to the beach.

I was thinking Ruby beach, but my mom wants warm weather and tanning. Washington can be cold so it seemed like a no go maybe. We have always gone to the beach during our once a year vacation (even if I don’t like it), and it’s usually always Florida or Georgia, or somewhere there.

I don’t mind driving an hour-2 hours to get the NP if it requires me to do so since I’m only one interested in hiking. 

A couple of important notes: 
- I’m based in TN
- My mom is disabled and uses a walking stick to get around, so if were to do a beach in a national park it’d have to be accessible (which is why I’m thinking a separate beach and NP might just be easier)
- This trip would be a week long and sometime after my class ends June 2nd.

Amex also added about $100 on top of the Qantas listed price, apparently due to travel insurance.

The flights were:
Perth → Singapore (Qantas)
Singapore → KL (Jetstar, operated by Qantas)

When we landed in KL on April 17 around 9 PM, our luggage didn’t come out. We waited until the belt stopped and confirmed with baggage services — nothing. We called both Qantas and Jetstar on the spot, but they basically pointed fingers at each other. Couldn’t contact Amex Travel because their support had already closed for the day.

We’ve had to buy essentials just to get by — I bought underwear, socks, a shirt, and walking shoes. My partner had to buy undergarments, toiletries, skincare, etc. I’ve been keeping all receipts in case we need them for a claim.

What’s worse is that all our plans for this trip have been impacted. We were supposed to go to Batu Caves, check out bars at night, and visit Petronas Towers dressed nicely. We even had a day trip planned to Genting Highlands. All of that’s basically on hold unless we go shopping here.

It rained on our first night, and I was only wearing my Adidas slides (only shoes I had in my carry-on). They had no grip and I nearly slipped a few times walking on the hotel pavement. I’ve got flat feet and my walking shoes were in my checked bag, so I was in pain every 10 minutes until I found new shoes to buy.

Day 2: Amex followed up with Qantas and Jetstar again. Qantas now says the bags arrived in Singapore, but no one seems to know what happens next or where they actually are. We’re still left waiting.

If anyone’s had something similar happen — especially with Qantas, Jetstar, or Amex Travel — would love to hear how you got it sorted. Also wondering what my chances are for getting compensated for all this mess.

Thanks in advance.

Finally I've narrowed it down to Spain from Italy, France (Italy the best option but looking to avoid this due to the Jubilee this year not sure if i should just take the chance).

Nonetheless planning for a 8-9 nights in Spain around September mid (hope the weather will be decent).

My thought process so far,

Land in Barcelona  
Spent 3 nights in Barcelona  
Fly to Mallorca : Spend 3-4 nights there (base in palma may be)  
Fly back to Barcelona : Spend the last night there and take the flight back to Toronto.

But here's where the dilemma comes in. I'm a big Real Madrid fan and if I'm travelling all the way to Spain, I will definitely regret not visiting Santiago Bernabeau. 

Is there a way I can fit Madrid in? Thought about taking one way flight to madrid and return to toronto from barcelona but tickets are way expensive this way compared to a return flight to/from barcelona.

Overall what I'm looking for in this whole trip,  
\-Vibe is to explore the city (i can skip some monuments/main tourist attractions) but this is more of a relaxing trip for me.  
\-Need a beach vibe where I just sit and relax. I don't want to be running around much.

Help me with figuring this out.   
\-Is Mallorca a must visit according to what I said above? Or should I think about skipping it and visiting other parts closer to Barcelona and add Madrid in there.  
\-Or is there a way I can fit everything in.

This is our initial plan:

* Two nights in Nice
* Two nights in Cannes
* Two nights in Marseille
* One night in Aix-en-Provence
* Three nights in Lyon

We will be traveling between these cities by train or flixbus. We do not have access to a car and are on somewhat of a budget. My partner also gets very travel sick and 4.5 hours on a bus or train is their absolute limit. Please do let us know if these cities are the right places to visit or if we should consider other places instead and whether these amounts of time in each city are realistic.

I will provide a brief list of things that are important to us in a vacation, in order:

1. Food. Not fine dining (again, budget), but we love trying regional foods. My partner is a real sweet tooth too.
2. Seeing the sights/walking around. Sounds a little dumb, but our favourite thing to do is just to wander around the city. Maybe look around a few shops (books and comics especially) or sit in a park.
3. Nature. We’re not big hikers and we do not have access to a car, so I’m sure many more ‘nature-y’ places out of the city are out of the question, but we do enjoy seeing green/natural spaces.
4. Beaches. Not looking to spend 10 days baking in the sun, but two or three afternoons on the beach would be nice.
5. Other activities. My partner isn't into museums and we are on a budget, but non-museum activities/sights that are under 15eu pp might interest us.

I’m still open to the idea of traveling outside the country though. We mainly want to swim in beautiful blue CLEAR water. I keep second guessing where to go because I know Hawaii can be pricey, so possibly I could go somewhere better/similar for the same budget price? Our budget is ideally 3-4k. I know, 4k max budget is crazy low for Hawaii, but I think it can be done lol! 😂 Through Costco travel, I found a package to Ohau that included flight, hotel stay for 5 nights and car rental for  around $2300 total, departing from Sacramento.

My parents have gone to all-inclusives in Mexico, and I’ve found a few all inclusive packages from Costco Travel that cost around the same or even less than the Hawaii packages. BUT, I’m also iffy about traveling to that area like Cancun because of the hurricane/sargassum season during that time. Our main reason for traveling to these places was to swim in the beautiful clear beaches, so I don’t know if I should risk the trip out there with the sargassum.

Where should I go, and what should I do while I'm there? My go-tos in new cities are always museums, bookstores, and cafes, but I'm open to other suggestions--anything that you think would help me feel a bit refreshed and reinvigorated, I'm feeling so bored/burnt out/uninspired lately and a change of scenery usually helps.

1k1eao7,reddit,Going to Southwest France/Northeast Spain this summer and looking for ideas!,"My family 3 Adults(68, 45, 44) and 2 children (14,11) are going to taking a trip this summer and I would love some recommendations. We are Americans. We don't speak French and we have very basic Spanish but we have no problem getting by even with language barriers.

* Flying into and out of Nice.
* We are renting a car(have experience driving in Germany/Czech Republic but not France/Spain so if there is anything we need to know chime in... We did get a ticket in Czech Republic for driving on a toll road without paying the toll. I though there would be toll plazas. There are not.
* We MUST go to Carcassonne(Family Bucket list item is to play Carcassonne in Carcassonne) but not sure how long to stay there. 
* We do not need to spend as much time in bigger cities. We tend to like mid-sized and smaller cities and we like to wander although we will almost certainly go to Barcelona and are open to bigger cities.
* We love culture/food/wandering. Small museums. Wineries. Off the beaten path touristy things. Small walkable cities with interesting history. Unique experiences (Making chocolate from raw cacao in Mexico). Good restaurants but not necessarily fancy. 

We did Amsterdam to Cologne to Prague 2 years ago as a family and learned a lot about what we do and don't like.

* Flew in to Amsterdam, which was great. Very walkable. Unique. Loved Van Gogh Museum and seeing the Ann Frank house was very moving and eye opening for the kids. Touristy, but very enjoyable. Best part was just walking the city.
* Cologne was cool. Loved the Cathedral. We stayed in a small city, Neuss near Cologne and we liked it. Meh... Cologne is cool but other than the cathedral I wouldn't really care to go back.
* Wandered to Quedlinburg. Loved the drive. Stopped at a few places along the way. 
* Spent 3 days in Quedlinburg(Playing the game Quacks of Quedlinburg in Quedlinburg was a highlight) and loved just walking around the city. This is one of our favorite travel experiences. Restaurant Helena was our favorite meal in Germany. 
* Wandered to Dresden via Leipzig and did a factory tour of the Volkswagen Glass Factory. Another highlight. 
* Drove to Prague and spent 5 days in Prague. We liked Prague, but it was too touristy. Enjoyed some of the tours. Would have cut this down to 2 days if I did it again. Favorite things in Prague were a Plague Tour where we wandered the city at night with a ""Plague Doctor"" and he told us about the history of the city specifically during the multiple plagues. 
* While in Prague we took a day trip to Kutna Hora (where the bone church is). Loved it. The Cathedral was our favorite cathedral we saw on our trip. The drive too and from was great as well.
* Drove to Nuremburg and stopped in Pilzen on the way. We liked Pilzen. One of our favorite meals of the trip was at Le Frenchie café) and Nuremburg was OK.
* Flew out of Frankfurt.

Were thinking about wandering through Andora. Is it worth it?

As a side note, we ~~like~~LOVE factory tours. The Volkswagen Factory was really cool. We like nature but aren't looking for long nature hikes. Food is huge for is. Love good restaurants but not chains. Bonus points for fun/unique history and culture things to do.

Question i have is for anyone who has been to mafia. I initially wanted to go to zanzibar as it is good kiteboarding weather, but I have been trying to swim with whale sharks for years. I also love to scuba dive and I guess I read it's better in mafia. 

However, I would prefer to self drive in Uganda, but they will not let me book it this far in advance for that short of a time.

Ag. Efstratios, I want to go there and go to the Nikolaos Sialmas monument.  
I am having quite some trouble being able to plan for that. I see ferrys from limnos are like twice a week. I dont know if car ferrys are going from limnos to efstratios often. I dont know if the rent a car will allow us to go there on the island. I was thinking something of going with a ferry there, visiting that, staying in a hotel for a night, and then going back to limnos.

Is it even possible to go that place? If so, any advice and info is very welcome.",2025-04-17 05:32:56,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,1,1,,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k15d0p/planning_a_trip_with_a_friend_to_limnos_and_ag/,MorphineAdminstratum

My girlfriends and I are heading to SLC early May for a girl's trip. We are in our mid-30's. Would love some suggestions from locals on how to make this an amazing trip (we all need it lol)

We love a blend of activities, outdoor, and just fun city vibes - nice sunsets, nice views, etc. Not big on sports.

 * Hiking: Read that we are too early for the season (Muddy, Biting Gnats, ETC). Was hoping to see if anybody had recommendations on ANY possible trails or recommendations for moderate hike (short a few hours). Read that it may be possible at silver lake, donut falls, living room trail. We are also going to the Salt Flats. Would it be possible to hike at the Silver Island Mountains? Any trail recos? (Maybe Graham Peaks?)

 * Restaurants: Looking for Vibey restaurants with delicious food (Dinners + Weekend Brunch with Mimosa. Any must-do recos? Was looking at places like Arlo, Urban Hill, Eva, Finn's, Maybe Provisions or Ivy & Varley for brunch - But really don't know if these are worth it!
Would have loved to do a restaurant and drinks with mountain views, especially on our way to the salt flats - but struggling on finding a place. Alta Lodge will be closed. Not sure is Snowbird's base-views are worth it.

 * Things to do? Any insider recos and tips would be super cool! Any seasonal things that we shouldn't miss?

 * Bars / Drinks: We like R&B Music and top 40 hiphop. We like nice speakeasy vibes for cocktails. We like nice views and good vibes. We like dancing. We are down for live music. This is the area that we really don't know lol. Wrote some stuff down online but really don't know!

Would love your help! :-)

1k0st04,reddit,Milford Sound from Queenstown,"Hello, I know there are a few posts about this but wanted to get some comments on our specific situation. We will be in Queenstown in beginning of July and plan a trip to Milford sound with 9 and 11 yr olds. Here are the different scenarios to consider:

We’d like to have 2 days (1night) for the trip.

1 We will arrive to Queenstown in a Campervan and thought we could keep it and return it until we get back. So we thought about driving in the campervan from QT to MS, then stay at the powered campsite there. Either driving very early, do the boat tour and stay the night. Then drive back the next morning from MS to QT.

2 Second option is to return the campervan and rent an SUV, then same thing drive to MS but now we’d have to either stay at the very expensive cabins in MS one night, or stay a night in Te Anau either the night before or the day right after the boat tour.

3 Take a 12hr tour in bus same day. (I think this might be too tiring and we wouldn’t be able to stop for photos since I heard the road has some amazing scenery for photo stops.

I‘ve heard different opinions and would like to have more information to make our decision.

I've been to Bali in november of 2023. I really enjoyed the trip due to the following factors and i am now searching for a new destination which is not Bali but checks the same basic aspects

\- obvious things first: The weather beeing very humid and warm. 30-35°C with 90% humidity is just amazing

\- scenery of Bali and Nusa Penida. The combination of tropical forest, seaside and a bit mountainous areas, waterfalls and also dry areas of nusa penida

\- not sure whether we were lucky but it was never crowded (probably good timing of november)

\- calm areas and smaller restaurants as well as very cheap street food

\- destinations beeing quite close so that I can drive by scooter from hotel to hotel

I am not looking for the crowded parts of Kuta or Ubid with the fancy cafe's, bars or clubs nor big beaches to relax.

We rented a scooter both on bali and nusa penida, and drove around ubud, Gobleng and as mentioned nusa penida, visiting waterfalls and enjoying the scenery. I want to take my drone with me again and idealy do something similiar: rent a scooter go with a backback from hotel to hotel and explore places, flying my drone and enjoying calm areas. 

I am thinking about thailand (without any specific areas yet) but I am not sure whether bigger distances make the idea of going by backpack on a scooter impossible.

1jzqoeh,reddit,Insight from frequent flyers,"Hi flyers,


I like to think I’m a fairly experienced flyer, but I don’t fly enough to have any kind of status and not too little that I don’t know what to do. I just recently took two US domestic flights (EWR to SEA, and then SFO to EWR). There were some things I noticed and some things I had questions/curious about from the frequent flyer community. 


1. I have been flying United for years and have been a mileage plus member as well. I have always been in boarding group 5 regardless of selecting an economy plus seat or even a preferred seat. Is this only a status thing? I’m not asking to be in group 1 or 2, but how am I never in group 3 or 4? 


2. Do you prefer to check in bags for domestic flights? Or do you just check everything in and don’t have to drag your bags around? I know some people have connecting flights and checking in wouldn’t help them in that situation. But for all others, what do you prefer?


3. I noticed some posts on this sub and on other flights related subs about asking for upgrades at the gate. I mentioned I don’t have any status with any airline. But every time I’ve flown, I make it a point to ask the gate agent for upgrade chances right near boarding time. 9 times out of 10, it has worked for me. Just recently on my trip from SFO to EWR, I got upgraded from all the way last row to an economy plus seat. I know there are factors like how empty the flight is, status, upgrade cost, etc. But it has worked for me most of the time. Others have similar experience?


4. As frequent flyers (or just experienced/capable flyers), do you look down on people who may not know what they’re doing or do you offer to help? I’ve seen both types of people, which is why I’m asking. There was someone on my flight who was clearly struggling figuring out her seat and her tv monitor, but nobody helped until she called for a FA. I also took a flight where I was seated in an emergency row window seat with a missing seat in front of me, so I was confused where to put my backpack. The lady in the row in front immediately turned and helped put my bag below the seat in front of her for takeoff and gave it back once in the air. I just wanted to ask the frequent flyers if you’re willing to help or let the FA handle it? 


5. Flying etiquette. Is it normal for people to take shoes/socks off during flight? Is it ok to lay down if your row is empty and you have all three seats to yourself? Any other flight etiquette issues you have seen? 



I’m asking these as a way to get insight into how people fly and how to improve my own experience moving forward. Thank you for any advice and/or suggestions!

1jzmgic,reddit,2 Weeks in Vietnam,"Me and my partner are heading to Vietnam this May for a 2-week trip. We're flying into Ho Chi Minh City and looking to keep the trip relaxing, with some light cultural bits, great food, and ideally being able to scooter around somewhere chill, not super urban.

I've already done Sapa, Hanoi, Lào Cai, and Ha Long Bay on a previous trip, so we’re trying to stick to the middle and south of the country this time.

Here's the catch: I’ve searched around this sub and everywhere people seem to be saying things like this.

* Hoi An – “too touristy” ""beaches are gross""
* Phú Quốc – “feels fake/commercial”
* Con Dao – “not the real Vietnam”
* Da Nang – “just a big city with a beach” ...so I’m a bit stuck.

What I *am* looking for is something with the same vibe as Ko Lanta in Thailand — laid-back, scenic, scooterable, not too built up but still with some options. Could be coast or countryside, or even a combo.

is anyone able to give me advice on how bidding works? i don’t want to bid too little and not get the seat or bid too much and get ripped off. 

on the other hand when’s best to upgrade? its an airbus A350-100 plane with 16 upper class seats total, 7 of which are currently available. do i wait until nearer the time? or do i pay the £1k to ensure i will have the upgrade? or am i getting ripped off?

i’ve flown long hall plenty of times but only ever flown economy, not even premium economy. we’re going to vegas for mine and one of the other person’s 21st so the upgrade would be like a little present to myself but i don’t want to get ripped off.

We’re heading on a holiday package with EasyJet Holidays this Friday, and we’ve just discovered that the hotel we booked - advertised as having an indoor pool - doesn’t actually have one. The indoor pool was one of the main reasons we booked it in the first place.

We’ve tried to contact EasyJet but their customer service hours are limited, and we’re unsure what they’ll actually do to fix it. We’d ideally like to switch to a hotel that does have the right facilities or cancel without penalty if they can’t provide what was advertised.

I'm a bit suspicious that they're going to find a way to weasel out of anything that may incur any expense or hassle for them. I've taken screenshots of the hotel ad on my phone (advertised on the EJ website) stating indoor pool, but the hotel's own website definitely says there is only an outdoor pool.

I was wondering if someone who’s local or has been to the area could have a look at my itinerary and let me know if it sounds like a good plan—or suggest something better.

My partner and I are flying to Toulouse for about four days (not full days, since the first and last are mainly for travel—but we do have an early inbound flight and a late outbound one) in June.

My idea was to spend one day in Toulouse, stay overnight in a hotel, and then head to Carcassonne the next morning. We’d spend the afternoon there—have lunch, maybe do a wine tasting—and then in the late evening, drive toward the coast.

I found a beautiful seaside town called Collioure, but it’s quite far, so I’m not sure if it’s worth the long drive given our limited time. I was also considering staying somewhere closer to Narbonne Plage, but based on what I’ve seen on Google Street View, I’m unsure if it has the right vibe.

Can anyone advise whether this plan makes sense, or if there are better alternatives or areas we should consider exploring instead?

1jyjb7p,reddit,One-Month Road Trip Advice – NYC to LA via Miami & New Orleans,"Hi all! I’m planning a one-month road trip across the US (flexible dates between May and August). My main city stops will be New York City, Miami, New Orleans, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles. I love big cities *and* offbeat attractions, so I want to mix tourist highlights with hidden gems and quirky stops along the way.

**Route Help:** What’s the best way to connect these dots? I’m thinking of starting in NYC, driving down the East Coast to Miami, then west to New Orleans, and onward to Las Vegas and L.A. Is this too much for one month? Any route tweaks you’d suggest (or must-drive highways vs. ones to avoid)?

**Car or No Car:** I’ll likely rent a car for flexibility, but I’m open to flying a segment if it saves a lot of time. Did anyone do a similar multi-city trip without driving the whole way? (I’ve heard drop-off fees for one-way car rentals can be high – any advice or alternatives?).

**Interests:** I’m into nature, roadside oddities, local food, comedy and live music, and art museums. Some specific things I’d love to find on the route: cool small towns, “world’s largest” roadside attractions, kitschy museums, beautiful hikes or parks, maybe a comedy nights in unexpected places.

1jyhdxq,reddit,Pre-Hike Acclimatization for the Inca Trail (Machu Picchu),"My friends and I are planning a trip to Peru to hike the Inca Trail (closer to end of September). We’ve joined a guided tour that starts on Monday and will be flying into Lima on Friday evening. I understand that we need to acclimate to the altitude in Cusco.

Our current plan is to spend half of the next day (Saturday) sightseeing in Lima, then fly to Cusco later that afternoon to acclimate for about a day and a half (Saturday evening through to our hike early Monday morning). Will this be enough time for us to adjust? Or should we travel to Cusco the same day we arrive in Lima or early the next morning to maximize our acclimatization time? Can we really make the most of just half a day in Lima?

Once the hike is over, we plan to fly back to Lima, where we’ll have one free day to sightsee before heading home. The main purpose of the trip is to visit Machu Picchu. Due to our limited time in Lima, what should attraction should we prioritize?

Is it possible to buy a travel insurance (trip and medical) policy for travel to Africa with an effective start date and departure from Europe (example: Spain, Italy, France, UK, Portugal) even if original residence of the traveler is in the US.

Example:
Traveler is already in EU from the US 
Example: US to France to US (one itinerary)

Buys travel insurance for another itinerary 
France to South Africa to France (insured trip)

Also some advice around how to use CFAR and preexisting conditions waiver

It looks like CFAR only works for cancelations 2 days before a trip and they only pay out between 50-75% of the trip cost.

And Pre existing conditions waiver requires purchase of the plan within 2-3 weeks of booking.

Most companies only offer 10-15 days to cancel a policy for a refund.

Is trip insurance really important when most companies will either rebook people if their trip is cancelled or delayed or offer compensation these days.

I’m planning to go to Interlaken in early in May and also the Salzburg region and Vienna towards the end of May. I’m mainly going to do mostly outdoor activities specifically hiking but I’ve been getting some mixed advice around the weather. I’ve been told that May is an underrated month to go because its sunny, things start to bloom and the weather isn’t perfect for hiking as it’s not too hot or not too cold. In addition it’s also relatively cheap. On the flip side, I’ve also been told it’s a no go because it rains a lot thus limiting the outdoor activities and also the ability to see the views that these places offer which is another reason I want to go. To anyone who’s been to these places in May or live in these places, what would your overall guidance be surrounding this? Would it be ok to do this in May or better to push this back till June?

1jy8z35,reddit,First Indonesian trip suggestions,"Hi!

My partner and I (late 20s) will be visiting Indonesia for the first time for 18 days in August and we are finding it really hard to craft our itinerary.

The first thing we would like to avoid is mass-tourism, so we are definitely skipping Bali. We would like to find places a bit further away from the common touristic path in order to explore more closely the culture and way of life.

Some things we would like to see/do in our trip are:
- Renting a scooter to explore an area at our own pace 
- Volcano trekking and waterfalls
- Beaches, preferibly with lush green vegetation (i.e we have seen pictures of beaches in South Lombok and they don't all appeal to us so much)
- Optionally, doing surf for one day if it fits (beginner level)

We initially thought of Yogjakarta/Mt Bromo/Mt Ijen, Lombok (we have read mixed reviews of it though, even though Mt. Rinjani is appealing) or some parts of Sumatra (here we don't know much as it is massive, but seems stunning).

Could you please give us suggestions for our trip?

1jy5sed,reddit,My Jordan and Egypt Experiences,"Hey everyone,

I just got back from a trip to Jordan and Egypt. I want to share my unusual experiences of my trip. Some of them could be true for any trip in the world.

1.	⁠I have forgotten to register for Careem in my country so I must have to register it in sharm el sheikh but I couldn’t register on Careem (Middle East’s version of Uber) because I couldn’t do SMS verification. I didn’t know how to activate my Turkish line for SMS. Learn it from youtube, it is easy.

2.	⁠Avoid using the Royssat bus station in Sharm El Sheikh. It felt completely unsafe because no one is there. Only you are waiting for your bus there. It is like a Hollywood horror movie. Even if you bought your ticket for royssat, you can go to watania which is more modern because watania is the second station of all busses after royssat. Do not go to royssat! Go to watania. Also, watania is more closer to city center.

3.	⁠We had a $100 bill and we could not changed it. Some banks in Cairo were randomly closed, and even ATMs or exchange offices often don’t have enough cash to give change for $100. Time was running out, so we took an Uber to the airport. I thought that I can change it inside the airport, so I went through security, but the exchange desk didn’t have enough USD to give me change either. Luckily, I saw another tourist exchanging dollars. So, now exchange office had 95 dollar to give me as change. Meanwhile, the Uber driver was waiting outside for 15 minutes. When I finally tried to go back outside to give him his fare, the police didn’t let me exit. I didn’t know that after you passed the first security, you cant go outside again. It is different in Turkey and European countries. After begging the officer several times, he agreed to personally take the cash to the driver, but he asked me some tips.

4.	⁠In Jordan, when we returning from Wadi rum to Amman, I have decided to stop at Ma’an because there is a wonderful bakery having delicious deserts of which I have tasted before. The bakery is Hasheem Affouri. Also, google reviews are great. We thought that Jordan is more modern and safe country after we saw Wadi Musa and Wadi Rum which are the most touristix cities of Jordan. We had wrong. Do not go to Ma’an which is dangerous. Only men are outside in the city and always stares you. We did not know that there is also Hasheem Affouri bakery in Wadi Musa. Buy your pasteries in Wadi Musa.

We are a little nervous and want to ensure we are doing the right thing.

Our question is, will the 72 hour transit visa be sufficient for the return trip from Chile to Melbourne? I.e Once the visa is granted, will it allow for multiple entries and exits (ie just can’t stay for more than 72 hours each entry - ie you need to be transiting) or will are we required to obtain separate transit visas for each leg of the trip?

I and my wife will be visiting Mauritius from India. I was looking at the car rental and I am totally confused with a few things. Ideally, I am looking for a car rental with full insurance and no deposit. Any suggestion on that front. 

Should I go for discovercars or easycabs? Are their insurances worth it? Can I rely on insurances provided by the local rentals?

How are roads in Mauritius? Should I worry about them? I consider myself to be a very safe driver and as an Indian, already know how to drive on the left hand side of the road.   
  
Should I worry too much about the deposit? Read at the few places that while handing over the car, car agencies try to make you sign the papers so that they can claim the deposit as people are looking to catch the flight.

I'll be coming from Ljubljana to the lake and have 2 days before my flight leaves.

Any recommendations on a good itinerary? Of course on the day I visit Bled I doubt it will take all day so I have the evening too. 


I'll add my full itinerary: 

Day 1. Arrive at 8.45 and drive to Piran

Day 2. Full day at Piran

Day 3. Drive to Ljubljana and on the way visit Skocjan and Predjama

Day 4. Full day in Ljubljana

Last time we visited Chiapas and rented a motorcycle to explore and looking to do that again. We like a mix of seeing the main sites and exploring little known corners on the bike. We are also very interested in the indigenous history and natural wonders. We like an adventure and don’t mind roughing it. If there is a less touristy/better alternative to anything listed I’d love to know, and if anyone has biked around here, I’d love to hear about your experience with that as well.

Day 1: fly into Cancun, bus to Valladolid to pick up motorcycle and drive to Merida 

Day 2-5: Merida city, Ruta Puuc to see various ruins, Cenotes Homun

Day 6-9: Valladolid, Chichen Itza, Ek Balam (return bike before beach)

Day 10-14: Holbox or El Cuyo (I hear these are getting overwhelmed but looking to end the trip with a few days to chill at the beach with a nice cabana and drinks and maybe a scuba trip. I visited Holbox in 2021 and have fond memories).

Any specific recommendations for good food, drink, activities in these spots is also appreciated.

Here's my rough itinerary for Vienna - honestly please let me know your thoughts because I could be super off here LOL:

**Day 1**

\- get to hotel, check in and chill by 1 PM; after that we're going to do a walking tour of old town (this will take us through ideally st stephen's cathedral, the graben, kartner strass, hofburg palace exterior, etc)

\- if we get lucky, standing room tickets at the opera

**Day 2**

**-** bright and early Schönbrunn Palace (Get there *early* to beat the crowds. Book tickets ahead for the Grand Tour with the imperial rooms) - maybe strudel show + zoo

\- we'll take a break and then do the hofburg palace complex + maybe the spanish riding school

**Day 3**

– Visit Belvedere Palace to see Klimt’s *The Kiss* and wander the gardens

\- afternoon we're going to do MuseumsQuartier -  go into the Leopold Museum or just lounge around the MQ courtyard with a coffee.

\- Go for an evening concert : a Mozart/Strauss concert in a palace or at the Musikverein.

**Day 4**

\- honestly so far I'm keeping this day empty - we don't have anything planned so let me know if I should do anything else!",2025-04-10 17:20:54,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,1,8,,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jw3dct/thoughts_on_my_vienna_itinerary/,sassyexec
1jvzvah,reddit,Early May Colorado Trip,"Myself and my partner are travelling from the UK to Colorado (flying into Denver) for 8 days at the start of May and the choices of places to visit are overwhelming! Can anyone offer some advice on where to visit while there?

We're trying to get a good mix of outdoors activities (keen for some good hiking and a horse ride or two, biking and kayaking also an interest), viewing wildlife, experiencing the natural hot springs and mountain town vibes of the state, and good food & craft breweries with some live music. Struggling to find a schedule that isn't too packed but fits in some of the key things we want to do - the tricky one being that we want to do the Black Canyon and my partner really wants to do the vapor caves in Glenwood Springs, which doesn't make for a convenient drive when we have to start and end in Denver! So the idea for the loop would be Route 50 one way and I70 another way - so basically general areas are:
- from Denver
- then to Colorado Springs (GotG, Cheyenne Mtn, Manitou Springs?)
- then to Cañon City (Royal Gorge)
- then to Salida (Poncha Springs, Buena Vista?)
- then to Gunnison (Crested Butte?)
- then to Montrose (Black Canyon)
- then to Glenwood Springs (Iron Mountain Springs, Vapor Caves)
- then to Golden (Red Rocks)

Obviously this misses out some key sites (Durango, Telluride, Boulder, RMNP) but it isn't possible for us to tick off everything without feeling like we're rushing around.

1jvbv84,reddit,Recommendation for a mid-august trip in Europe,"Hello everyone, reposting this with additional details as per Rule 4.

Me and my SO will both have our vacation days available in mid-august, from the 11th to the 24th, and will likely pick the second week.

Since a few years ago I have avoided visiting cities during summer to avoid the heat, instead opting for spring and autumn, but we have not yet visited a city together, and have instead opted to stay in the mountains relatively nearby (northern Italy) in our travels together so far.  
I would like to change things up this year, buuut I would also like to avoid heatstroke.  
Is there an European capital or cities in general that are not too terribly hot that you would recommend?  
By terribly hot I mean we would like to avoid a weather comparable or worse than how it is in northern Italy during the summer, usually in the mid to high 30s and lots of humidity.  
I think countries at a similar latitude as Italy would not work because of this, ruling out Lisbon and Athens for example, don't know about Eastern Europe.

There are some that I'd rather not pick because one of us has already been there, or because we plan a group trip in the future (Iceland) , so the ones that have come to mind so far were Dublin, Amsterdam and Oslo (where unfortunately one of the museums I would like to visit is closed currently, so I would postpone).  
There's also Warsaw, which is a bit more towards the south, Helsinki and the Baltic states, these I haven't read up on much yet.  
  
We have been, by ourselves, to Berlin, Paris, Prague, Wien, Stockholm, Madrid and Copenhaghen, and both really liked Prague in particular (and I also enjoyed Wien a lot, I found them somewhat similar).  
We enjoy museums, castles, old towns and so on, the standard fare, and we hike a lot during the year, so if there is any interesting destination for one day outside the city, it would be cool as well.  
  
We would likely stay for less than a week, budget would be in the 150ish € per night range, more if necessary (: as long as the hotel is in a decent position, is not dirty and the beds are not made of stone we are fine, we would be spending most of the day out and about anyway.  
  
Any recommendations? I am focusing mostly on capital cities, but I know that of course there are plenty of amazing places all over, I just tend to opt for them when I first visit a country, but if you have any other kind of suggestionfor smaller towns and other areas it will be definitely a welcome addition, as there may be more options that involve cooler temperatures.

1jv32ki,reddit,"Inexperienced traveller asking for advice on trip to France, Spain, or Italy including vineyard tours/tastings - detailed post","Hi all. I've long been interested in short holidays from the UK to some of the biggest wine-producing countries in Europe, but I'm not an experienced traveller. I'm also what you might call ""geographically challenged""; until I've been to a country/place, I find it very difficult to figure out distances or what's on offer nearby. 

I've done some Googling about vineyards and places to stay, and also tried to have a look around south-west France on Google Maps. With both, I've just ended up more confused than I started. I've also done some searching here, but thought in the end it's better to start a thread with my specifics, seeking advice.

Since I'm not very versed in travelling, the below are based on best guesses. Please can you share your ideas?

**Budget**: £2000 for flights and hotel for two people. Other activities/tours/taxis/travel not included in this budget.

**Duration**: Either 5 or 7 days (including travel).

**Where you’re starting**: We live in Scotland UK, so we'd be looking to travel from Edinburgh/Glasgow, or Manchester airport if necessary. At a stretch we could fly from London airports, though this would be much less convenient.

I'm interested in visiting France, Spain, and/or Italy and seeing some vineyards in those countries. I'm not talking about going to \_all\_ those countries on one visit; it'd be an either or/one country per trip. What I'm asking for is good areas - and within that maybe narrowed down to places/hotels - to stay in those countries based on the rest of the information.

We'd be looking for comfort, peace, and quietness in our hotel/place to stay.

**Interests & preferences**: My husband and I like quiet hotels and pretty views, and are looking for areas to visit in the countryside rather than cities. We especially like staying by the sea and this would be a bonus, though appreciate this may not be possible in all cases when trying to be near vineyards. 

We also like good food and would be looking to include plenty of that in our trip, be that within the hotel or in nearby towns. 

Due to health reasons I can't walk very far, and distances need to be supplemeneted by automotive transport (e.g. taxis, or possibly driving although this latter is not very useful if we're visiting vineyards - want to be able to enjoy the wine). Although this detail on walking/health might limit how much we can do or how far we can go in a given day and may mean we need to stick close-ish to our hotel, it is what it is. 

We'd be looking for a slow pace trip combining some activities and some downtime, not packing in loads of stuff every second of the day.

I'm interested in visiting vineyards especially, to both look round them and partake in tastings of their wines. Please see list below of favourite grapes and so vineyards (/wine areas) I'd prefer to narrow selection down to.

We would also be happy to soak up some culture/things to see or do in quiet, small nearby areas.

Favourite grapes so far: 

* France: Malbec, Syrah, and Grenache; secondary favourites Cab Sav and Mourvèdre
* Italy: Sangiovese, Amarone; secondary favourites Primitivo and Montepulciano 
* Spai: don't know Spanish wines so well. Do like Tempranillo (esp in Rioja blends) but that's fairly standard I guess

If we go to France, I'm especially keen to see some vineyards associated with my favourite grapes there. Of the old world wines, French is my favourite wine region. In general of course there's never anything wrong with trying new-to-me grapes and finding new favourites!

I hope this post has enough detail. I'd welcome any advice or thoughts on where we should stay, and the vineyards, food and activities that fit with our parameters here.

1juwozz,reddit,Moving flights a year into the future,"My wife and I had booked flights with Emirates for a Europe trip. We are meant to fly out early June and return mid-september of this year. 

Turns out we can't go this year. We now want to move our flights to roughly the same dates next year. The problem is that airlines won't book that far into the future. 

I rang Emirates. They said my only option is to cancel our flights and cop the $1,000 cancellation fee. Oh, and those comfortable seats we booked at over $400? They are nonrefundable. 

I'm now wondering whether it would be better to change the booking to a couple of months into the future, then change it again when the actual dates I want become available. The double change would cost around $900, and the seat booking would be carried over, so theoretically I'd be over $500 better off. 

Would this work? Is it a good idea? Any advice will be appreciated. ",2025-04-09 03:44:53,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,0,10,,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1juwozz/moving_flights_a_year_into_the_future/,FeistySloth

Speaking to Emirates, the fee for canceling is 500 GBP \[about $650\]. Does it seem right that the travel agent \[dialaflight\] can keep the remaining cash?

Safe to say we had an amazing time as a family! Despite some minor bumps and some tweaking on the itinerary on-the-go, we would say the trip was a memorable one - particularly Yosemite NP was a highlight. Stunning views, majestic trees and good weather all round.

  
So now we're planning for our second trip in the summer (June) of 2026 and would like some recommendation as well as advices. As of now, we have narrowed to two options, but still early in our brainstorming stage so we're open to other ideas

Our criterias:

i) 3 weeks time span

ii) Something slightly different in our National Park experience than before

iii) 1 or 2 stops in a big city would be nice as a break from sightseeing and a little shopping.

  
**Option 1 - Miami, Everglades NP, Great Smoky Mountains NP, Washington, Philly and New York**

First few days in Miami, take a flight to Atlanta, rent a car to GSMNP and road trip all the way to Washington - a few days there, then Philly and lastly New York

  
**Option 2 - Las Vegas, Grand Canyon NP, Zion NP, Denver and Rocky Mountains NP**

Start off in Las Vegas and then road trip to Denver while stopping at Grand Canyon NP and Zion NP for a couple of days each before arriving in Denver and explore Rocky Mountains NP.

  
I'm looking for inputs on weather, stop options (activities for families), how many days are recommended and whether the road trip journey is even feasible. We are also aware that the World Cup will be happening during that time and also partly hoping that we can get tickets depending on which option we take.

We don't mind spending only 3-4 days in each NP as we found that 4 days in Yosemite NP is enough for us family.

- Edinburgh (and day or two in and around the city exploring)
- Rosslyn Chapel

The Lowlands :
- my maiden name is Armstrong so we are visiting their ancestral homelands. Doesn't seem to be more than a day in that area.
- Gilnockie Castle and surrounding areas

Highlands :
-I'm thinking of using Inverness as a ""homebase"" while we spend a few days exploring the Highlands. Is there a better option?

Other ideas:
- Glencoe
- Culloden 
- Castle Stirling
- Are there other castles we need to see?
- Loch Lomand
- Loch Ness? I've seen some say to skip it?
- Train to Glenfinnan Viaduct

We love coffee shops, bookstores, game stores, and days spent in nature. We hike and camp often and don't mind walking/hiking several miles a day. We're history buffs, especially military history. We love the idea of renting a car and just driving!

1jtrigx,reddit,Dominican Republic - Visa free entry and then apply for the extension,"Hi,  
If anyone can please help in answering these questions. We are from South Africa, and we planned a trip that will last 62 days in total, flights are booked and non-refundable.  
  
I was under the impression that we do not need a VISA, but then only later on realised that the fine print said, ""if your stay is less than 30 days.""  
So of course everything is a mess now, as there is physically no more time to get a VISA in time before we leave. We are leaving for the USA in 10 days. But only going to the Dominican Republic in 2 months.  
  
Does anyone know if we will be stopped from entering the country in the first place with the flight tickets that are 62 days apart? If that is not a problem, can I then just go and apply for an extension immediately for our full stay?  
If they will not allow us into the country with the flights so far apart, is it better to book a flight out within 30 days. Then go into the country. Then apply for the extension, then cancel the flight and then stay on as was planned, and take the original flight back.

I know I should’ve followed the proper process, but life has changed, and we are truly blessed now with the opportunity to travel and take a vacation. I now work as a freelancer.

Hi everyone,

I’m planning to travel to Taiwan with my child and his dad in December 2025. We’re not married, but our child is already 13 years old. My concern is about my travel history.

I traveled to Cambodia twice on a tourist visa, 7 and 8 years ago. Both times, I entered as a tourist but ended up working there. On my second trip, the immigration officer (IO) asked me if my OFW status was canceled, and I said yes because I didn’t even know I had been tagged as an OFW. I only stayed there for a short time, less than 3 months, before returning to the Philippines.

Both times, I also did visa runs to Vietnam to extend my stay. Now, I’m worried that when I travel this December, even though I’ll be with my child and his dad, I might be questioned by immigration. I’m also concerned that they might ask me for a canceled OEC, especially since I’m not sure if I was officially tagged as an OFW on my second trip.

**Disclaimer:** Please don’t judge me for my past decisions. I know I should’ve followed the proper process, but life has changed, and we are truly blessed now with the opportunity to travel and take a vacation. I now work as a freelancer.

I will be visiting cannon beach on Thursday and will only be there for one night. I wish to see haystack rock. But that’s all that I know. I will be driving in from Seattle and reaching cannon beach around 4/5pm on Thursday. I will first go to haystack and watch the sunset.

I will need to find a breakfast place that’s open around 6/7am (most I saw so far are not open until 8am). Any suggestions on where I can grab an early meal? I am from the east coast, and whenever I visit the west I’m always up super early due to time difference. Any suggestions on dinner and an early breakfast spot? Also anything else I can fit in during my quick stay other than haystack? Any advice helps thanks!

1jtb03o,reddit,Help planning a Nepal trip (16–22 June) for a group of 8 (mixed age group) — how does this itinerary sound?,"Hey everyone! I’d love some advice on planning a 7-day trip to Nepal from 16 to 22 June 2025. We’re a group of 8 people — 4 of us are in our late 20s and the other 4 are around 60, including my dad, who’s turning 60 during the trip. So we’re hoping to make it special with a mix of scenic, cultural, and nature experiences that aren’t too physically intense.

Here’s the rough itinerary I’ve come up with:

🗓️ 16 June – Arrive in Kathmandu (\~3:30 PM), stay overnight  
🗓️ 17 June – Explore Kathmandu (Swayambhunath, Patan Durbar, and a private pooja at Pashupatinath Temple to mark my dad’s 60th birthday)  
🗓️ 18 June – Fly to Pokhara, explore Lakeside and Phewa Lake  
🗓️ 19 June – Drive Pokhara → Bandipur (scenic stop + lunch) → Chitwan National Park (arrive by evening)  
🗓️ 20 June – Safari and jungle activities in Chitwan  
🗓️ 21 June – Fly back to Kathmandu, relax or light sightseeing  
🗓️ 22 June – Depart from Kathmandu

A few things I’d love your input on:

* Is Chitwan the right pick for wildlife, or should we consider another park like Bardia for this kind of group?
* Any thoughts on Bandipur as a stopover — is it worth it, or would it be better to head straight to Chitwan?
* Any tips for organizing a private pooja at Pashupatinath Temple? (We're doing this as a special part of the birthday celebration.)
* Any suggestions to make the 60th birthday extra memorable — either in Kathmandu or somewhere along the way?
* General feedback — does this itinerary feel too rushed or does it strike a good balance for a mixed-age group?

I'm 27F traveling for 2 weeks in Germany & Austria in late July to early August and I could use some help planning my itinerary. I'm flying in from Canada to Dublin on July 24th and will be leaving from Dublin on August 7th. This is my 3rd time in Europe, however it is my first time solo travelling and am looking forward to experiencing a lot of nature in these two countries! I’m an experienced hiker and in good shape, so I want to do as much hiking as I can. I will not be renting a car, and will be using trains/buses for transport whenever I can! 

Here's the VERY ROUGH timeline I have in mind:
* Day 1: arrive in Dublin, staying for 1 night. 
* Day 2: Fly from Dublin to Munich, stay 1 night. 
* Day 3: Train from Munich to Salzburg, explore for the day. 
* Days 4: Take a bus to Berchtesgaden and hike around that area, return to Salzburg at the end of the day. 
* Days 5: Spend the day in Salzburg, maybe do some tours or visit museums. 
* Days 6: Take bus and hiking - Untersberg
* Day 7: Take train ride from Salzburg to Innsbruck, hang out for the day. 
* Day 8: Hiking - Wolfsklamm Gorge
* Day 9: Hiking - Otzal Valley
* Days 10 - Take train to Garmisch Partenkirchen
* Day 11: Hiking - Zugspitze
* Day 12: Train from Garmisch Partenkirchen to Munich
* Day 13: Hang out in Munich for the day.
* Day 14: Fly to Dublin and return home.

Please let me know your recommendations for the places/hikes I listed above! Is it far too many hikes? I plan on doing a balance of easy and more difficult hikes in each of the areas mentioned. I’m also still on the fence about Garmisch Partenkirchen!

1jt3067,reddit,Malaysia - convince me to go to KK or Penang instead of Langkawi,"We're planning a trip to Malaysia, 7D6N in KL and 5D4N at a beach resort. We have two kids, 5 yo and 3yo. Our requirements are pretty simple - we mostly want to relax at the resort, go into town here and there, and only a couple of outings/excursions that the kids can enjoy. We've been to Penang once (without kids) and Langkawi three times (twice with kids), and contrary to the sentiment on this and other subs we found Langkawi much more fun and relaxing. I'll say that our Penang trip was probably not well planned, we stayed at Shangri-La which was not close to Georgetown and we found our beach to be quite busy because of the amount of water sports being run nearby. In Langkawi we stayed along Cenang Beach, we weren't bothered that it was the most touristy part of the island and appreciated being walking distance from convenience stores, restaurants and local shopping. We have no experience with Kota Kinabalu, the beaches and resorts look fantastic (considering Shangri-La Rasa Ria) but the nearby activities/excursions don't seem to be little kid friendly. I'm not sure if Grab operates in Sabah, would be a bummer if not because when the kids got bored of resort food we could always order mcdonalds/kfc/burger king to the resort.

So the easy choice for us is Langkawi because it's a known quantity that the kids enjoyed a lot and there's more to do that we didn't get to in the last two trips. But we also want to try somewhere new, so either giving Penang another shot or doing something new for all of us like KK. We did consider places like Tioman and Perhentian but getting there will be torture for the kids and eat a bigger chunk out of our allotted time to travel. Am I missing any other options in Malaysia? I know people have strong opinions against Langkawi, but we wouldn't lose any sleep choosing it over other options.

1jt1c7f,reddit,VAT refund (CDG - HEL - LAX) with a 1h20 layover,"I tried to dig for some old posts before posting, but I wasn't able to find anything.

I am planning a trip to Paris in September. Since I will be purchasing goods while I'm in Paris and plan to claim my VAT refund, I believe I have to claim my refund before I depart the EU (so during my layover in HEL).  However, my layover is only 1h20. I feel like this probably isn't enough time, but wanted to get other people's opinions. Should I look for a completely different flight to be safe? I've never flown into HEL before, so I have no idea how efficiently things are run there.

Thanks!

1jsvyap,reddit,Anyone ever had false damange claims from airbnb hosts?,"We stayed at an airbnb in Sorrento over 2 weeks ago. Now he is claiming we shattered his shower door and is asking for like 2400$ (it was a tiny cheap standard european shower but he says it was costum). We are so pissed because obviously the door was fine when we left, we went to the bathroom multiple time before leaving to make sure we didn't forget anything. So we would have seen. The host was also there when we left (and also seemed to go to their airbnb every day while we were gone to check on things) so he would have seen the airbnb right away and not 2 weeks later. We obviously refused to pay but how likely is it that we will have to? Of course we should have taken videos of the whole place before leaving to show it was fine (although you couldn't prove we didn't break everything after the video anyways).
The worst part is that we left a great review, even though there was a lot of false advertisement and I ended up sleeping in the living room because the 2 bedroom they said they had was a lie.

1jsvuwk,reddit,Looking for advice on Guadeloupe,"Hello everyone!  
I’m traveling to Guadeloupe at the end of April for 10 days with a group of six adults and one toddler (under 2 years old). We’d like to hike La Soufrière—without the baby, of course—and I’m wondering:

– **Hiking La Soufrière**:

* Is it better to go with a guide or without one? I like the idea of being independent, but a guide might add interesting info and extra safety. Any thoughts?
* What’s the best time to start the hike to avoid crowds or fog? I often see suggestions to leave very early, but does it really make a big difference?

– **Hot springs in Bouillante**:

* I’m looking for a spot that isn’t too touristy, with clean, safe water. I’ve heard of natural hot springs in the area, but I’m not sure where they are exactly or if they’re still in good condition. Any specific addresses or GPS points you can share?
* Are there better times of day to go to avoid crowds, or any “hidden gem” locations you’d recommend?

Thank you in advance for any tips! I’m open to all kinds of suggestions for making the most of my stay in Guadeloupe.",2025-04-06 14:50:57,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,1,0,,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jsvuwk/looking_for_advice_on_guadeloupe/,annita999

My in laws have agreed to keep our kiddos for a week and my parents are keeping our pup, so we're looking at traveling somewhere within an 8hr flight of Pennsylvania in mid July. We've considered the Carribean, Hawaii, and the North East (Maine, New Hampshire), PNW... but I think I'm overthinking everything because I really want this to be a special experience for us. We've decided that Hawaii is just too far and we'd waste too much time traveling with only having 7 days. I am a big fan of the beach and small towns and my hubby loves to explore (rent a car, hiking, adventure). We're looking for somewhere that we can combine beach, small town, exploring, good food and stay around 4k total for flights and lodging. We want a safe area so we can rent a car and explore, so that's something to consider. We're willing to spend a little more depending on the location. We've even considered splitting our stay into two different hotels/resorts to have a few days all inclusive and a few days not. Any suggestions? Maybe we should go to the PNW?
