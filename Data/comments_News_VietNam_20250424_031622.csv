VietNam,1jyul4n,mn1appx,"The man's reaction isn't necessarily endemic to the citizenry here, but the driving habits certainly are.

I've been here since 2014. In 2017 the roads were flooded with cars seemingly overnight, the result of the end of a 100% tax on all vehicles.

There is no way this place properly prepared for any aspect of private car ownership.

There was ample time to:

\- improve the infrastructure to accommodate the increase in private cars

\- develop driver education programs

\- improve traffic ordinances

\- increase public awareness about the dangers of mixing motorbikes and automobiles

BEFORE they lifted this tax.

If I, a puny expat could see all of this coming because I heard the announcements about it years before they actually lifted this tax, why couldn't they?

Instead of doing any of the things mentioned above, they simply opened the floodgates and blamed motorbikes on all of the woes in the big cities.

The majority of automobile drivers simply push their way through anything that gets in their way, and the number of near misses I've had in the past several years are too numerous to count.

I applauded the recent hike in traffic fines, but it hasn't taken long for drivers to figure out that they don't have to become more considerate and respectful drivers. The kinds of behaviors that get people here killed or seriously injured will never be adequately dealt with now that the wave of automobiles has taken over the streets.

The time to do all of that was, again, BEFORE they lifted this tax.",138,2025-04-14 09:44:33,Consistent-Beat-8883

VietNam,1jyul4n,mn19grd,"I was hit by a car in Hanoi a few years ago. The driver wanted to overtake a motorcycle, but engaged completely in the wrong lane... My lane.
We crashed into each other, I fell and I was disoriented. As I got by the side of the car, the car driver litteraly drove on the bike and left the scene.
There was perhaps 10 witnesses in the street at that time, staring, at least half of them were recording with their phones, only 1 helped me to move the bike out of the road.
The accident itself shocked me, but I was even more shocked by how insensitive were people",118,2025-04-14 09:31:15,ResponsibleCredit933
VietNam,1jyul4n,mn1as1q,"I would say to any tourists - if you're getting a Grab spend the extra money and get a car and not a bike. I wouldn't be as dramatic as OP because I don't think both Vietnamese don't value life as much or that they are in awe of a debit card (????) like they've never seen one before. But yes traffic is insane, Hanoi is far worse than anywhere else including Saigon. 

I've had Taxi drivers play games on their phone while driving, bikes driving both the wrong way and then mounting the pavement, seen like 5 people on one bike (family with kids) all without helmets of course. Don't get me started on some bus drivers too.",147,2025-04-14 09:45:13,tommycahil1995

You also don't know the whole story, it's not uncommon for motorbikers to zoom out of blind alleys way too fast for cars to react.

I was driving in Da Nang and a taxi came up behind me honking, he came really close and started honking like crazy..made me nervous. I tried to move to the side of the road so he could overtake me, unlucky for me this was Son Tra sand and loose stones were covering the side part of the road, so I slipped and fell. Was badly injured but luckily fell to the side of the road and not infront of the taxi driver.

The real shock was what happened after I fell. The taxi driver sped up and kept honking. Didn't even care.",27,2025-04-14 10:20:34,chenjp
VietNam,1jyul4n,mn1a8lj,"I can absolutely speak to how recklessly a lot of people drive in Vietnam. However your post feels very one sided. The police will have to investigate who’s at fault, and yes, sometimes it’s the bike riders who are being those aforementioned reckless drivers. That moment when you saw the car driver smile might have just been a reaction to dealing with the police, not necessarily a lack of remorse. What I do agree with you on is traffic here is pure chaos. But making a blanket statement about the entire character of Vietnamese people isn’t fair or warranted",161,2025-04-14 09:39:33,Eastern-Unit-6856

VietNam,1jyul4n,mn1b1jg,"I'm here for 3 months letting (edit) learning Vietnamese. It's my 6th trip here. In the months leading up to me arriving I was looking on Ho Chi Minh marketplace for a 50CC or an e-bike. 
First couple of weeks I was here I hadn't got my permanent accommodation I was just in a hotel so I didn't even consider renting or buying a bike until I found permanent accommodation. 
In a week on the back of grabs probably had about four or five near misses. Was when I decided I will just leave the riding up to the locals and just get grabs everywhere.
 In my country we drive on the opposite side of the road, that combined with the crowded skate park like chaos of the roads made me decide to just pull the pin on getting my own transport and use grabs.
 It can be scary especially with the little plastic coated styrofoam lids that passes helmets here. It does seem to be a level of acceptance that death is a part of life that we seem to not have as much in the West. I don't know if it's scoot (edit) good or bad it just is what it is.",13,2025-04-14 09:47:58,s2b69

VietNam,1jtpr3l,mlw0c2x,"PETER NAVARRO: The reality here is that institutionally, the international trade system is designed to cheat us—they have systematically higher tariffs on us, but far more importantly, it’s the nontariff cheating. It’s the VAT taxes, it’s the currency manipulation, the dumping, the export subsidies, the fake standards that keep our agricultural products out and keep our cars out of Japan—it’s all these things that these foreign countries do that are designed explicitly to cheat us and are sanctioned by the World Trade Organization too. President Trump says, “No more—no mas—ain’t happening on his watch.” And that’s where we’re heading—towards a strong America that makes things again.

FOX NEWS: What you’re talking about here at home is a deindustrialization. You’re talking about reprivatization, which is crucial and essential not only to our future but also to national security. When you bring up the nontariff barrier, there was a lot of conversation about how the reciprocal tariff formula was calculated, and you mentioned those nontariff barriers were taken into account. You’ve got a country like China that’s coming back and saying, “We’re going to impose a reciprocal tariff,” but other countries—for example, Vietnam—saying, “We’re going to take our tariff down too.” Everybody wants to know what the president is going to do—is he going to take Vietnam’s tariff down to zero, or because of those nontariff barriers, does something stay on?

PETER NAVARRO: Jackie, I’m so glad you asked that question because Vietnam is the poster child for the nontariff cheating—let me walk you through that. We were on about a $123 billion trade deficit with Vietnam—if you simply lowered our tariffs and they lowered our tariffs to zero, we’d still run about a $120 billion trade deficit with Vietnam. The problem is all of the nontariff cheating that they do—let me walk you through some of the things they do.

The first biggest problem is that Vietnam is essentially a colony of communist China—China uses Vietnam to transship to evade the tariffs. How does that work? Vietnam sells us $15 for every $1 we sell them—and about $5 of that is just Chinese product that comes into Vietnam—they slap a “Made in Vietnam” label on it and send it here to evade the tariffs. But Vietnam is also the biggest dumper and biggest user of export subsidies—I don’t know if you saw the clip of that beautiful Louisiana shrimp guy saying, “Hey, God bless Donald Trump for protecting us”—do you know who he’s protecting them from? Vietnam.

We know they do export subsidies because at the Department of Commerce—that’s the one that slaps on the anti-dumping countervailing duties—so they do that. And then they have the VAT tax—they have a 10% VAT tax—they use some of those phoney standards. The sum and substance of all this, Jackie—it’s like every country around the world cheats us—but it’s like fingerprints—they all do it in different ways—it all comes down to the nontariff cheating.

It was interesting to hear Elon Musk at the beginning talk about a zero-tariff zone with Europe—he doesn’t understand that. And the thing that’s, I think, important about Elon to understand—he sells cars—that’s what he does. If you look, for example, at the Tesla factories in Texas, they’re assembly plants, and they get a lot of their content from China, Mexico, Japan, and Taiwan, and elsewhere—what President Trump wants to do is turn Detroit back into Detroit instead of having Detroit in Mexico now like they have it.

The guy who—Brian, that Liberation Day ceremony almost stole the show from the boss, the UAW worker. He pointed to all those factories in Detroit that can be rapidly filled up—we can’t just be an assembly nation—BMW with German engines—

FOX NEWS: We need to manufacture, and we need to assemble—if I can just circle back to Vietnam, does that mean the tariff stays?

PETER NAVARRO: Sure—yes, I mean, look, here’s the thing—this is not a negotiation—this is a national emergency based on a trade deficit that’s gotten out of control because of cheating. We’re always willing to listen—that’s what Donald Trump does best.

But I want to just say to the world here—if you want to come and talk to us, don’t say you want to lower the tariffs and be done with it—it’s the nontariff cheating. Stop manipulating your currency, stop dumping stuff in—Europe, take your 19% VAT tax down to zero—don’t put these fake agricultural standards that keep out our pork and our dairy and our chickens—and Vietnam, don’t dump shrimp into our markets and put the good people of Louisiana on our coast out of work. This is what people have to understand—it’s the nontariff cheating that matters the most.",40,2025-04-07 16:45:52,Resident-Pen5451

c) This is probably an attraction for Vietnamese tourists, not for foreign tourists.

VietNam,1jy51y8,mmz95pn,"Yes, and it's like that almost all the time. To summarise the reasons

- theyve upped the number of flights to make $$$$ for the few
- they've shadow banned anybody who doesn't have a ""VIP"" pass from using the express check in. You can figure out the meaning of VIP. So disabled, small children, elderly all have to do the big queue without these passes.
- they don't have an up to date IT system, instead they use something from the days of windows XP. Immigration is slow. They are too ""proud"" to use a good non Vietnamese system
- they don't have enough staff. Only connected people can do this job and as it's a uniformed floor job it's mostly moronic nepo nieces and nephews. 
- they don't have enough space to expand for more equipment for security checks etc.
-They won't use segregated queues for immigration. I've never seen any other country not have this or snaking lines. Idiotic!!!


For some reason the two main airports here are terribly run hell holes that could be fixed in 12 months with a bit of brain power but they choose not to.

VietNam,1jq7sb9,ml5f3ru,"I have a masters degree in economics and business administration, for what its worth. There is a lot of misinformation or ignorance about tariffs, that's why my lengthy reply:

Short version:
Dont worry this isnt good but it's not as huge as it sounds, tariffs are on CUSTOMS VALUE, not retail value meaning that the cost of these tariffs aren't going to cut into the revenue THAT much, especially since some of the tariff cost will get forwarded to American customers. Some products will be hit hard but those generally don't offer that many jobs Anyway. In the end, vietnam has the opportunity to trade with other markets as those also will get tariffs by usa. Being less dependent on the USA is a good thing. 

Long version;

It won't ruin the entire economy. Some % the companies will absorb, some % will be passed on to the consumer. This is temporary. Even if it lasts for years, Trump will be gone in 3.7 years. And probably a Democrat will be elected next to fix the horrid mess trump will leave behind and abandoned these foolish measures.

Also don't forget the usa already has tariffs on these goods. Example on clothing the tariff is already around 19%, so that's still going to be increased but it's not from 0 to 46. (NOTE: doesn't apply if it's an extra blanket tariff)

Anyway heres more info about a tariff;

A t-shirt on sale for 10 dollar in USA doesn't mean the company needs to pay a 46% tariff on 10 dollar, the value of an imported t-shirt (also called the customs value) is more like 1 or 2 dollar. So a tariff of 46% could be 46-92 cents. So a 10 dollar tshirt will cost 10.50 or 11. There will be a smaller demand as that always happens when price goes up, but won't be a lot as clothing is a necessity. Same applies to much of its textiles and lesser extend the shoes. Other products like tech etc will have less big margins so will hurt a bit more but American households will feel that pain more and the companies can look to try to sell to others, worst case they move part of production and vietnam loses some jobs, but many of those companies just came to vietnam after heavy investments. So we will need to wait an see

Of course on a national scale that's big numbers, but on the micro level it's being blown a bit out of proportion. And consumers are on a micro level.

For (European) cars and raw materials the issue is much bigger as a car or raw materials being imported already has close to the sale value and profit margins aren't that big. But most of what vietnam exports isn't high cost. So don't worry. 

Also, the USA is tariffing most of the world, everyone will be looking for new/more markets. So, Vietnam can do the one thing which is the biggest asset you can have in business-> a diversified market/portfolio (as in, less dependency on USA, trade more with EU, China, Africa, ...) 

In the end, this only damages the USA long-term, as they lose standing and trade relations, and their consumers will pay more for EVERYTHING. The US doesn't have enough workers to take back all that production. He must know this due to his team of advisors. So, one must wonder wtf are Republicans trying to do over there. (Putting on my conspiracy hat) Working for Putin or Xi seems doubtful, my guess is just they want to destabilize the USA to get more power. Basically a conservative coup of the nation.

Well, yeah, but there are levels to budget traveling.

Some people simply avoid luxury on vacation because that's not representative of the country they're visiting. I bet 90% of the Bali or Dubai ""travelers"" for example haven't spoken to a single local that wasn't their ""servant"" or vendor. I went to trips like that in Egypt and some middle eastern countries and I can't say I've been to Egypt, I've just been to a resort and some guided tours.

Some people are just poor students on vacation. They might be German, but that doesn't mean that it's practical for them to travel for a month or 2 without some major budgeting. A similar budget trip in their home country would be 3000€ for a month instead of 500€ + plane. If you have 1000€ saved up, what are you going to do, 1 month in Vietnam on a budget, 2 weekend trips to neighboring towns, or a GPU?

I was born in a poorer European country. My trip budget for a year was \~200€ during university years. But if I had money for a plane to Vietnam on top of those 200€? Hell yeah I'd waste a month of my summer vacation in Vietnam ""budgeting"" instead of rotting at home.

VietNam,1jiz50w,mjmere0,"I'm with you. As someone that also travels a bit, and also born in Viet Nam, it does bother me that the country is so often known as a ""cheap destination"" and so it attracts the cheapest sort of tourists. 

Of course the currency exchange rate is a huge plus (which I benefit myself), but I'm talking specifically people who come to VN because it's cheap, not because they have any curiosity about the culture or care for the people. 

Like you said, they aren't looking to do or learn anything - just stretching their already-strong currency to the absolute max then complaining about the cheap options they choose themselves.  

This nail salon I went to in Da Nang had a young tourist girl *screaming on the floor*, refusing to pay because she misunderstood prices clearly stated on the menu. The difference was something like a couple euros. The salon actually split the difference and took a loss - all for homegirl to give them a bad review anyway.

The tariffs aren’t meant to be long-term or sustainable. That’s why the rates were determined the way they were. 

The goal isn’t to screw the other country. The goal is to make a favorable deal for the US. I know people will try to say that’s one and the same. But not always. And in this case…let’s see what To Lam and Trump can iron out.

VietNam,1k2rftd,mnweq79,"As I was commenting on another board some months ago when discussing Ukraine, for at least 40-50 years now, American intervention in Cold War context has always been from bad to disastrous for the side that they support. The last time it came out alright was with Germany, Japan, South Korea in the immediate aftermath of World War 2. After that, we got an uninterrupted series of either disadvantageous or terrible outcome for America's favorite local side: Cuba, Vietnam, Nicaragua, Afghanistan, Syria, now Ukraine, the list goes on.

It's not necessarily because America's intention is bad, or that their cause was not ""righteous"" (sometimes the cause was arguably less bad than the other side). The biggest problem is that: 1/ America is never interested in what the common people think and care about, and 2/ America ALWAYS think money solves all problems. The first thing the US do is throw money and weapons into the conflict, and when problem arrives, instead of trying to understand and resolve and/or negotiate, American would always double down and throw even MORE money and weapons in. What does money do? It corrupts, and A LOT of money (compared to the standard of living in these countries) just corrupts spectacularly. Mean while, more weapons may prolong the conflict and increase its deadliness, but it never changes the outcome. The side that got US money and weapons are always the losing side, eventually.

Inevitably, after each failure, there would be reams and reams of ""reports"" and ""lessons learnt"" and commentary from all the decision makers about why it was wrong, what was wrong and what should be changed. But the next conflict arrives and like clockwork, the same sh\*t happens again. Granted, it may serve America's national interest to have an outlet to spend all that money (in the name of foreign assistance) and weapons (raison d'être for the huge American military industrial complex). Maybe that's why America keeps following that same failing MO for so long. But it's generally bad for the local population on both side of each of the conflicts.",37,2025-04-19 09:04:33,labzone

VietNam,1jxyvbp,mmufjtc,"If you read his final book, he's actually a bit more pessimistic about Vietnam's leadership.

Quote: My own view of Vietnam’sreforms has been revised considerably from the rather more optimistic one Iheld at the time of my first few visits in the 1990s. 

Vietnam’s oldergeneration of communist leaders, I now believe, is incapable of breakingout of a fundamentally socialist mindset.

They had initially agreed toembark on the journey of reforms because they could see that the country
was not going anywhere. 

But they have not since come close to exhibitingthe genuine determination to overhaul the system that one finds in China.

But do something about corruption. If not, it will drag everything down.

Singapore was not always squeaky clean. We are all the same, us SEA countries, our people’s “working DNA” has similarities. But LKY and his team had the gumption (or power play) to stamp out corruption and we got to where we are today. 

To be fair there is still corruption in Singapore (see the most recent incidents) because people are still people. But on a societal and individual level, it’s seen as unacceptable and frowned upon. You are playing with fire if you try to bribe a cop in Singapore.

VietNam,1jxyvbp,mmunq0h,"I am Chinese. Originally, I held this view, but now I think the possibility is slim. There are three reasons for this.

First, whether it was Japan, the Four Asian Tigers, or China's rapid development, they all grew with the support of the U.S. market. However, looking at the current tariff war, the U.S. market has effectively closed itself off to the world. The United States is now focusing on bringing manufacturing back home.

Second, setting aside the broader global context, Vietnam has developed for many years but has not demonstrated the same growth potential as East Asian countries. Currently, Vietnam's per capita GDP is comparable to that of China in 2007 and South Korea in 1986. In those years, China and South Korea had R&D expenditures accounting for about 1.4% of their GDP, while Vietnam's R&D expenditure is only 0.3%. R&D investment is a decisive factor in determining whether a country can become a developed nation. Given the existing certain level of capital accumulation, Vietnam's extremely low R & D level indicates that there are not enough enterprises and universities in Vietnam capable of undertaking R & D functions.With such a low R&D investment, Vietnam is likely to experience stagnation in GDP growth once its income reaches the level of seven to eight thousand U.S. dollars, just like other Southeast Asian countries.

Third, there is the issue of social governance. While China has faced serious corruption issues, its institutional framework has enabled the country to crack down on corruption with high pressure. Although Vietnam's system may appear similar to China's on the surface, there are significant differences. Vietnam's governance model, which relies on regional factional checks and balances, makes it difficult for the country to enforce strict anti-corruption measures. For example, regarding the military's involvement in business, China allowed the military to engage in business activities in the past because the country was so poor that it needed funds for development, and the military had to fend for itself. However, once the economy began to grow in the late 1990s, China banned the military from engaging in business. Vietnam, on the other hand, has not been able to achieve this.

Fourth, if corruption is not effectively treated and solved for a long time, and is allowed to devour society, there may be two possible results. One is similar to the color revolution in Ukraine. The whole society collapses, and the achievements of economic development over the years are destroyed. The second is similar to the Philippines, where corrupt elements take away most of the achievements of economic development, which eventually leads to a sharp decline in the country's development level and becomes a failed state.

Due to Vietnam's communist system, the first possibility is higher. The good news is that the United States Agency for International Development, which specializes in color revolutions, has been disbanded.

I hope Vietnam can solve the corruption problem as soon as possible. After all, there are not many socialist countries in the world.",49,2025-04-13 05:15:40,Impressive_Two_2539

If it means Vietnam will be one of Asia’s biggest economies, then it is possible. VN has one of the biggest populations in Asia and is on pace to surpass Japan soon.

However, population size means nothing on its own. Indonesia has the 4th largest population in the world but its geography and tribalism (not to mention corruption) makes it exceedingly difficult to become an Asian Tiger. 

VN has a huge advantage over many other Asian countries as it only has one main language and its geography is not as challenging as Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines.

**EMBASSY OF POLAND**  
Soviet Russia played a part in the rise of Nazi Germany's military [power.How](http://power.How) was this possible?   
After World War I, heavy arms restrictions were imposed on Germany. Berlin cleverly circumvented them through illegal collaboration with the Soviet Union.  This allowed them to quickly rebuild their military potential, which led to the start of the World War II in Europe.    
Forbidden German tank and military aircraft constructions were tested in research centres in the USSR:  in Kazan (KAMA Tank School),  Lipetsk (Lipetsk fighter-pilot school), and Volsk (TOMKA gas test site).    
Thanks to this secret German-Soviet cooperation, Germany developed new weapons and military strategies in a very short time.   
Modern armed forces, especially tanks and military aircraft, were the key component to the Nazi Third Reich's military success. And it all started with the signing of the Treaty of Rapallo on 16 April 1922.   
Ironically, today the Russian authorities justify their aggression against Ukraine precisely by fighting neo-Nazism and fascism

VietNam,1jyvfk1,mn2b2qi,"## **Reuters:**

> * Xi begins three-nation Southeast Asia trip in Hanoi
> * Vietnam tightens controls on some China trade under US pressure
> * China, Vietnam sign agreements on rail links, supply chains
> * Vietnam greenlights jets approved by China, government says
> * China's COMAC signs deal with Vietjet, document shows

> HANOI, April 14 (Reuters) - China's President Xi Jinping on Monday called for stronger ties with Vietnam on trade and supply chains amid disruptions caused by U.S. tariffs, as he attended in Hanoi the signing of dozens of cooperation agreements between the two Communist-run nations.
> The visit, planned for weeks and part of a wider trip in Southeast Asia, comes as Beijing faces 145% U.S. duties, while Vietnam is negotiating a reduction of threatened U.S. tariffs of 46% that would otherwise apply in July after a global moratorium expires.

> ""The two sides should strengthen cooperation in production and supply chains,"" Xi said in an article in Nhandan, the newspaper of Vietnam's Communist Party, posted ahead of his arrival on Monday. He also urged more trade and stronger ties with Hanoi on artificial intelligence and the green economy.
> ""There are no winners in trade wars and tariff wars,"" Xi added, without mentioning the U.S. specifically.
> After he met Vietnam's top leader To Lam, the two countries signed dozens of cooperation agreements, footage of the documents reviewed by Reuters showed, including deals on enhancing supply chains and on cooperation over railways.
> The content of the agreements was not disclosed and it was unclear whether they involved any financial or binding commitments.
> On Saturday Vietnam's Deputy Prime Minister Bui Thanh Son had said around 40 agreements would be signed. A separate aviation business deal was signed on Sunday.
> Under pressure from Washington, Vietnam is tightening controls on some trade with China to make sure goods exported to the United States with a ""Made in Vietnam"" label have sufficient added value in the country to justify that.
> One memorandum of understanding signed on Monday is to boost cooperation between the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which issues certificates on the origins of goods.
> Vietnam is a major industrial and assembly hub in Southeast Asia. Most of its imports are from China while the United States is its main export market. The country is a crucial source of electronics, shoes and apparel for the United States.
> In the first three months of this year Hanoi imported goods worth about $30 billion from Beijing while its exports to Washington amounted to $31.4 billion, Vietnam's customs data show, confirming a long-term trend in which imports from China closely match the value and swings of exports to the U.S.
> 
> ^Vietnam's ^exports ^to ^the ^United ^States ^have ^increased ^in ^parallel ^with ^its ^imports ^from ^China ^in ^recent ^years

> **RAIL LINKS, PLANES**

> After a two-day stop in Hanoi, Xi will continue his Southeast Asian trip on Tuesday by visiting Malaysia and Cambodia from April 15 to 18. He last visited Cambodia and Malaysia nine and 12 years ago, respectively.
> 
> Xi's trip to Hanoi, his second in less than 18 months, aims to consolidate relations with a neighbour that has received billions of dollars of Chinese investments in recent years as China-based manufacturers moved south to avoid tariffs imposed by the first Trump administration.
> Vietnam's Lam in an article published on Monday on state media said Hanoi wanted to boost cooperation in defence, security and infrastructure, especially on rail links.
> Vietnam has agreed to use Chinese loans to build new railways between the two countries, in a major confidence-building step that would boost bilateral trade and connections.
> However, no loan agreement has yet been announced.
> After prolonged pressure, Beijing obtained Vietnam's approval for planes authorised by the Chinese aviation regulator, which paves the way for the use of China-made COMAC passenger jets in the Southeast Asian nation.
> Hanoi recognised China's regulator as equal to those of the United States and the European Union, according to a decree the government approved the day before Xi arrived, and disclosed on the government portal on Monday.
> COMAC planes are operated by several Chinese companies but have so far struggled to find foreign buyers or be approved abroad.
> On Sunday, Vietnam's budget airline VietJet (VJC.HM)
> , opens new tab and COMAC signed a memorandum of understanding in Hanoi, according to an invitation to the event seen by Reuters.
> One COMAC C909 regional plane with Vietjet's livery and the logo of China's Chengdu Airlines was parked on Monday at Hanoi international airport.
> The content of the agreement has not been announced yet, but Reuters reported in past weeks that under a draft deal, Vietjet would lease two COMAC C909 planes, operated by crew from Chengdu Airlines, on two domestic routes.
> Despite strong economic ties, tensions frequently surface between the two countries over contested boundaries in the South China Sea.
> Vietnam's concessions to the U.S. to avoid tariffs may also irritate Beijing, as they include the deployment of Elon Musk's Starlink satellite communication service in the Southeast Asian nation, in addition to the crackdown on some trade with China over possible fraud on rules of origin.
> Vietnam, in recent months, has also imposed anti-dumping duties on several Chinese steel products and ended a tax waiver for low-value parcels in a move that government officials described as aimed at reducing the inflow of cheap Chinese goods.
> The two other countries on Xi's Southeast Asia itinerary, Cambodia and Malaysia, are facing U.S. duties of 49% and 24% respectively, and have already begun reaching out to the U.S. to seek a reprieve.

VietNam,1k5kiz4,mokdfcx,"Masan is the worst company when it comes to malicious campaigns to kill its competition

- Search 3MCPD for the scandal it created to kill other soy sauce brands.

- ""Fish sauce with Arsen"" or ""Nước mắm có chứa thạch tín"" is also the rumor they made to kill traditional fish sause so they can sell their chemically-produced fish sauce

- ""Chiến dịch hạt nêm 2010"" for seasoning.

- ""Chiến dịch mì gói 2011"" for instant noodles.

- ""Chiến dịch cà phê 2012"" with Vinacafe.

Basically this company is using the same dirty trick every time they wanna sell something of their own: by creating shocking rumors that the product on the market has chemical/health risk and then they will introduce the product that is clean of those problems. The rumors tend to kill their competitions during spreading process. This has been repeatedly used for a long time. Masan is not a company with good moral.

Oh, and in 2019, Japan recalled 18,000 bottles of Chinsu chili sauce imported from Vietnam due to the presence of sodium benzoate, a preservative banned in Japan but still legal under Vietnamese food safety regulations. The incident raised concerns about differing international food standards and the responsibilities of exporters. Masan, the producer, stated that the sauce was made for the domestic market and was not intended for export.

A) international airport staff must know English, basic requirement but no none knew. B) staff offer girls from our flight that they will give them discount on their extra luggage if they refused to ask for receipt (obviously they wanted to keep the money by themselves) C) No staff member told a fixed amount of how extra baggage per kg is charged. D) majorly under staffed E) worst of all our flight was at 7.45PM and by 7.10PM we were in the queue for boarding pass and baggage drop because of 6 counters only 2 were open and this was the situation in Hanoi the capital. India with all its flaws, at Delhi airport with less to huge crowd all counters (generally 10 per airline minimum) are active.

As a tourist from India we also felt discriminated towards. Example flight to china was top priority but India noooooo. Did not see this anywhere in the country but at the airport yesterday. Leaves us a little sad!",2,2025-04-22 09:12:54,EnthuCutlet0996

I had to learn this at 9 years old. We were walking to a Vietnamese community near our house. It was a 10 minute walk. A Laotian or Cambodian man followed us around the area, so we kept walking to an American grocery store. He followed us there too. When we went to check out, I looked back and saw him waving for me to come to him.

One piece of advice I can give you is her parents (or grandparents) are rich, not her. Once you marry her, you become her ""provider,"" and since she grew up rich, she will have certain expectations. Additionally, wealthy families are very good at protecting their wealth, so just because you marry into her family doesn't mean part of it, or any of it, comes to you/her.

If your families are close, I imagine they know each other enough to know your family is not from money, but of course before entering a marriage, y'all should have detailed and open discussions about expectations, limitations, concerns, et cetera.

VietNam,1jn4i96,mkh5cb6,I married a rich family in Vietnam. Met her in America. I can tell you that it's just going to based on how the family raised her and what the family value is. Their money is their money never ask for it. You need to know that you and her are not rich and you guys will have to deal with everything together. I will say as long as they are not stuck up date her for a while and see how the family treats you. I never met my father in law until 2 years after marriage and he was super happy with me but he raised his daughters to pursue what they want and to find anyone that makes them happy. I am very grateful for what we have and were given. My only advice is if she is rich you need to date her for a while to see if you are compatible with her.

**- The Final Memos at the White House: The Collapse of the Republic of Vietnam.**

**- When the Allies Fled.**

  
My conclusion:

By 1974, South Vietnam was already on the brink of collapse. After the 1973 Paris Peace Accords, the United States had withdrawn its combat troops and significantly reduced military and economic aid. The 1973 Arab-Israeli War triggered a global oil crisis that severely impacted South Vietnam’s import-dependent economy, leading to inflation, fuel shortages, and declining public morale. Meanwhile, the South Vietnamese military was overstretched, facing growing desertions and weakening defenses as North Vietnam escalated attacks. With President Nixon’s resignation in 1974 and growing opposition in the U.S. Congress, South Vietnam was left without the support it had once relied on. In practical terms, the United States had effectively abandoned its ally, leaving the Republic of Vietnam to face mounting internal and external pressures alone.",53,2025-04-21 04:53:39,Sad_Year5694

In the bao cấp period, the enameled iron cup is eveywhere because they are cheap and durable. Glassware at the time is a luxury. 

During the 90s, glass becomes cheaper (and bao cấp is no more), therefore people got access to glassware easily. I guess this is one of the first cheap and popular design at the time so everyone got that, and it kinda becomes extremely popular during the 90s and 2000s. That's mean different manufacturers were also copying that design as well.

With the 2010s coming, people got more money and higher requirement for nicer design. These cups are only kept for the nostalgia.

In 2019, 9% of imported plastic waste in Vietnam came from the EU, with Japan accounting for 41.9%, Hong Kong for 8.25%, and the Philippines for 6.47%

VietNam,1jt5w09,mlte98u,"Ignoring culture and whatnot since that is a very subjective thing:

Functional waste management structure needs an efficient system of waste collection and disposal. That's really the secret. 

Vietnam would first need to start with getting rid of landfilling. Mostly that means building waste-to-energy capacity. That is how for example Western Europe does it. After that you can think about what you want to start recycling. Fundamentally if you don't have capacity to treat waste, you don't have a system of waste management.

Second is the system of waste collection. Make waste disposal easy for households and businesses and ta da, they become clean and won't litter. I'm convinced this has little to do with culture. People all over the world have magically gone ""clean"" from ""dirty"" after a functional infrastructure gets put in place. Waste management is 100 % about infrastructure.

It’s not as simple as putting new trash cans/dumpsters all over. You gotta have people who regularly empty them, then vehicle to transport them,then a place to dump them. Transportation is hard due to how bad traffic is. 

- Transporting/emptying public dumpster at night is not feasible because the dumpsters get filled up at midday.

VietNam,1k0ds0e,mnd95kk,"From Bloomberg reporters Andy Lin and Spe Chen: 

When President Donald Trump launched his first trade war with Beijing in 2018, driving up the cost of goods from China, companies raced to relocate factories making everything from computer chips to crop tops south of the border in Vietnam. The Southeast Asian country’s economy has boomed as a result, with growth in gross domestic product accelerating to 7% in 2024, the fastest in the region. But the surging volume of incoming parts and outbound finished products has also left Vietnam’s transport system under strain.

To alleviate the logistics bottleneck, the Vietnamese government is embarking on one of the largest infrastructure drives in its history, spending billions of dollars to expand national highways and add congestion-reducing alternative routes across the southernmost part of the country. These ambitious projects hinge on one key commodity: Cambodian sand.

Vietnam aims to complete more than 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) of highways in 2025 — assuming Trump’s latest trade war doesn’t derail things. But it’s running low on its own supply of sand, dredged from rivers then used to flatten and stabilize the ground before pavement is poured. Sand mining in Vietnam has been under stricter public scrutiny after multiple riverbank collapses destroyed homes and angered residents.

​Over the past 39 years, from 1985 to 2024, Vietnam's GDP increased approximately 30.9 times, growing from $14.09 billion in 1985 to an estimated $435.6 billion in 2024.

Over the past 64 years, from 1960 to 2024, Vietnam's GDP increased approximately 87.1 times, growing from an estimated $5 billion in 1960 to $435.6 billion in 2024.​

These figures illustrate Vietnam's significant economic growth over the decades.
(Data from Macrotrends.)

According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Vietnam is projected to be among the top 20 fastest-growing economies in 2025, with an estimated GDP growth rate of 6.1%. This positions Vietnam ahead of several regional counterparts, including China, Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia.​

Though GDP just means the economy is producing more and doesn’t automatically mean everyone is becoming richer. It does mean the country is headed in a positive direction.",174,2025-04-10 16:10:36,isit2amalready
VietNam,1jw18ca,mmerkkt,"Nobody thinks vietnam is coming for the #1 spot anytime soon. What people are betting on is the potential for growth relative to many countries in the region. 

Vietnam is #15 in Asia by GDP nominal. It is 1/8th of Japan and 1/36th that of China. 

In a world where Vietnam can scale to inherit even 5% of china’s manufacturing/export, it’s HUGE growth for Vietnam. 

So investors are banking on growth, not domination.",36,2025-04-10 16:12:33,spamfridge
VietNam,1jw18ca,mmewzbp,"Vietnamese are more realistic tbh. Outsiders see high growth number, see HCMC and think the gap is close.


But VN base is low, really low. So catching up will take time, especially as maintaining 9-10% growth rates forever is not realistic. After crossing 10k USD GDP per Capita threshold China developed...in similar speed as Poland after that threshold. Moreover to do it you need to avoid any bad event like war or economic wipeout for 30-40 years.


Just as math exercise let's compare VN (4.3k GDP per Capita) with Poland (22,000 GDP per Capita).


10% growth for VN is 430 change. 3% growth for Poland is...660 change. Vietnam grows quicker but... distance actually widened.",27,2025-04-10 16:39:07,26idk12

VietNam,1jw18ca,mmep0f9,"Gentrification in a developing country. Rich foreigners with wealth from better valued currency and a safety net are willing and able to take risk in Vietnam. If they succeed, they dominate the economy. Native average vietnamese citizen usually have neither the wealth nor the safety net to make risky economic decision => they don’t see any potential gain for themselves. plus, they will lose the chance to succeed if too many gentrifying foreigners succeed in the first place",20,2025-04-10 15:59:50,MartinDinh
VietNam,1jw18ca,mmir82n,"Vietnam has *a lot* of promise. It’s a pretty united country (not a patchwork of different groups like India), and it’s close to economic powerhouses like China and Indonesia. It still has room to grow - like improving its factories, fixing corruption, and building better roads and ports. Plus, it has a long coastline, which is great for shipping and trade.

But here's the thing: **a lot of Southeast Asia has those same strengths**. What makes the whole region exciting is that it's caught in the middle of big powers - China, India, and the U.S.. And countries there tend to work together and don’t fight much (ASEAN), which helps business.

Also, Southeast Asia is more open to free-market growth, just when the West is adding more rules and China is getting stricter. So, with all the cool new stuff coming - like AI and biotech - this region might be the perfect playground to try it all out.",8,2025-04-11 06:11:16,_Koch_
VietNam,1jw18ca,mmj0rhp,"There are 3 major issues that will prevent Vietnam from becoming 'rich' so to speak. These have to be largely resolved (or being well on the way to resolution) within the next 10 years or it won't happen.

1. Corruption - steps are being made which are positive, but it's not yet enough. It is deeply embedded culturally, creates enormous wastage / inefficiency, and puts a handbrake on progress, and also turns off a lot of FDI that could potentially come in. VN needs a massive mindset change top to bottom, and need to do it quickly.
2. Demographics - under the age of 20, there is a large surplus of boys and a large deficit of girls. It is a HUGE gap, and will result in a demographic crisis within 10-20 years.
3. Nepotism - I've lived in a number of countries, and the amount of times I've seen people succeed because of who they know, not what they know, is a bit astounding and incomparable to many other places. This creates an increasing brain-drain of the best and brightest overseas.",7,2025-04-11 07:49:19,HomoSapien908070

VietNam,1k12fe6,mnitns4,"VN is a very cutthroat culture. People don't seem to know yet that if you scam someone you are bound to get scammed yourself too, sooner or later. But the main reason why there is so much scamming (and increasingly so, IMO) is because VN is a deeply unfair society: hard work and work ethics aren't rewarded, so people figure that the only way to get ahead has got to be through scamming / scheming / bribery etc. Also, and despite all the BS propaganda, the gov has been handling VN's economy rather poorly over the last 5years or so, so lots of people are resorting to scamming, which is a polite way of saying ""criminal activity"".",144,2025-04-17 02:54:09,Own-Manufacturer-555

VietNam,1jx1q71,mmn1s61,"**No expert, but here's my Theories**:

\- Business relationship is more integrated \~20% of vn's total exports is purely SAMSUNG.

\- Vietnam, esp Da Nang and Nha Trang, are seen as ""trendy, adventurous, and exotic"" destination for Koreans.

\- Lots of Low cost (\~$150 RT) flights to VN from Low Cost Carriers: T'way, Jeju Air, Jin Air, Air Busan, Fly Gangwon, Air Seoul and we can't forget VietJet + Bamboo routes. Not to mention the full service legacy carriers too!

\- Value--Seafood is also a luxury in KR, but in Da Nang it's a fraction of the price.

\- KR is a younger country than JP, more equipped to cross the  crazy streets of VN.

\- Media: explosion in travel programs, K Dramas, youtubers, tiktoks in KR language coming to VN.

In my 3 days in da nang, i saw many Koreans, lots of golf tours it seems, and i don't blame them. \~4-5 hour flight to an 'exotic' country where golfing is is 2x more beautiful and 0.33x the price.",56,2025-04-11 22:18:11,No-Grade-3533
VietNam,1jx1q71,mmn0yob,"1. Theres lots of Korean people and companies working in Vietnam since SK invests a lot in it. As a result people from Korea tend to visit their families there.
2. Tourist attractions in Vietnam are nice and the climate is very mild compared to that of SK so naturally it would be a popular destination for people wanting to get away during holiday season(you get can see lots of stores written in Korean in Nha Trang). The flight distance is fairly short too only like 4-5 hours.

As for the Japanese people I think they just don’t go and visit other countries a lot? Thailand is a way more popular tourist destination world wide and the delta between them and Vietnam is only like 300k from that table. That's my take on this anyways",47,2025-04-11 22:13:26,upgrade_china

Exports rose an annual 10.6% in the March quarter, accelerating from 7.9% in the final quarter of 2024.

The investigation was sought by domestic solar manufacturers and initiated under former President Joe Biden.”

Yeah sucks for some US solar companies who depend on cheap shit from abroad. But if you’re a US business who makes solar stuff, imagine competing with companies across the ocean whose governments subsidize them to the point they can sell shit *below* cost.

VietNam,1jy4pcp,mmvohm1,"Locals are not very keyed into the cultural component of Trumpism. But this is why I can hang out with, and even count among my good friends, a lot of VN people living in VN who are major Trump supporters. I could never see myself having anywhere near as many American friends that are--most of those people wouldn't want to have anything to do with me either, being a black, bisexual, pro-abortion, pro- morphological freedom, anti-religion, vegan, francophone, former American academic living in the EU.

When a non-US based Vietnamese person tells you they like Trump-- especially a person who's not from the west, not an advanced-level speaker of English, and who's seeing him outside the cultural context surrounding him and his worldview-- they're often interpreting/evaluating him through a totally different lens, i.e. 'tough on China', or bling millionaire/""American dream"" type. All the cultural, identity, racial, ""great replacement theory"", ""christian"" when profit dictates, class stuff-- none of that is part of the Trump brand for most of them.

I've found-- and I can admit maybe this is just a foreign perspective-- but I've found Vietnamese people, especially in the south, to be extremely reasonable, educated, open to discourse, and open to having their minds changed by a sensible argument. This is the opposite of Trumpism.

It's why when a lot of these people tell you they are ""for Trump"", it means something different than when an a native born American says the same thing. A Vietnamese person who was not raised in the west who is ""for Trump"" is not buying into the whole MAGA thing, they've mostly just latched onto one or two aspects of the guy that appeal to them.

And it's fair not to expect them to have the same understanding of what Trump means-- the US is another country. Even in incomplete knowledge, they still know a hell of a lot more about US politics than most Americans know about theirs.

VietNam,1ju1os2,mlzdosn,"Navarro on the Financial Times today telegraphed what they expect Vietnam to do in negotiations:

He wrote:  
""President Trump is always willing to listen.  But to those world leaders who, after decades of cheating, are suddenly offering to lower tariffs––know this: that's just the beginning.

We will want to hear from countries including Cambodia, Mexico, and Vietnam that you will stop allowing China to evade US tariffs by trans-shipping exports through your countries. The far bigger threat lies in the web of non-tariff barriers that continue to choke American industries. And that, too, must end.""

\*\*\*

It worries me that this requested concession isn't more prominent in Vietnam's action plan.  The US is still being unreasonable, but at least they are for perhaps the first time, giving clear directions on what they are seeking in negotiations.

I grew up with “Kinh Van Hoa” - a series of adventures of 3 kids - meeting people, learning new things, solving mystery - they have Scooby Doo vibe, if you know what I mean. Then, a lot of romance novels kinda deep from Nhat Linh and Khai Hung like “Doan tuyet” - still quite true when I was teenager, seeing the conflict between conservative, traditional family lifestyle vs modern life style. 

I also enjoy “Vang bong mot thoi” - not a novel though but like a collection of all hobbies or lifestyles that were once famous. Helped me understand a lot of old traditions.

It's about a fallen noble man's souls got swapped into a radom butcher's body for a second chance of life . Even the soul want to stay good , the body's bad influence is too strong and making him do bad thing . In the end , the soul chose to stay dead because the more he remain in this body , the more corrupted he would be .

  
It's more like a folklore , not a novel , but it show us how much dilemma human have to face in life : the soul want to do noble deed but our body demand earthly desire that should not be ignored . The most profound part of this story is that when the soul confont the body why it is so damn vulgar , the body replied : I have needs too , why are you keep blaming me for my nature when your soul could not exist without a body ? You're speaking of noble deed but when thing not going your way , you shift the blame to the body ? How is it fair ?

VietNam,1k3okhq,mo3x25r,"Nguyễn Minh Châu's short story ""Chiếc Thuyền Ngoài Xa"".

If you study it in your school, 90% of you will prob not really understand the metaphor and imagery behind it. The way they teach it doesnt exactly help either when what they mostly say the story is depicting a post-war society still filled with hardships and poverty and that the artists/creators' responsibility is to create works for society and that they should have a multi-positional view.

However, upon diving deeper into it, you start to realize the hidden metaphors Châu is trying to depict at the time. Here are some good examples.

Phùng's boss making unreasonable request forcing him to take photos that should is impossible considering the weather --> Criticising leaders making unreasonable demands and standards workers have to reach

The fisherwoman begging the jury Đẩu to do nothing and the woman not having trust in Đẩu --> Criticising the slow response and the bystanding nature of the juridiction which is just there to be there.

The woman's husband being a former soldier who fought in the war turning to be brutal --> Behind the heroic facade that the Party keeps trying to paint soldiers, they are in the end still humans that can act like douchbags.


The last scene where Phùng keeps being reminded of the fisherwoman whenever he looks at the picture he took, the one that got highly praised by critics and enjoyed by the mass alike --> A reminder for every authors/artists/journalists out there that behind the glamarous society that media depicts, there still always exists a darker side of reality that is hidden away from the normal view and mass.

And this still largely holds true today in Vietnam. Heck not just in Vietnam but also applies to many countries with a broken/authoritarian system. This is why I love this story a lot.

VietNam,1juxhvu,mmrxfjw,"I made a post about Ha Long Bay that popped off so I won’t be surprised if this is a response to me. Nonetheless, here is my response to you:

Overtourism isn’t JUST about litter in the water. There are plenty of other adverse impacts. I outlined those in replies to people under my post but I’ll lay them out here for you.

1. Environmental Degradation:
- Boat traffic stirs up sediment, damages coral and seagrass beds, and causes shoreline erosion. It isn’t as though there are just a few boats. There are only boats as far as the eye can see. 
- Anchoring can destroy fragile underwater ecosystems. Again, this is happening at a large scale.
-  Foot traffic from tourists tramples vegetation, erodes trails, and damages habitats on nearby islands. I remember the island we went hiking on. There were tourists lined up to go to the top of the hill. The line barely moved. If that’s not over-tourism, I don’t know what is.

2. Wildlife Disruption
- Noise from boats and large crowds stresses wildlife, disrupts breeding, and can force species to flee their natural habitats.
- Feeding or approaching animals alters their natural behavior and can lead to long-term ecological imbalances.
- Increased litter and human presence attract invasive species and pests.

3. Water & Air Pollution
- Fuel spills, waste discharge, and sunscreen chemicals pollute the water, harming marine life.
- Diesel engines on boats emit CO₂, NOx, and fine particulates, contributing to air pollution and degrading air quality for locals and wildlife alike.

4. Waste Management Overload
- Local infrastructure often can’t handle the sheer volume of waste, leading to garbage in the water, on trails, and in otherwise pristine areas. This, again, isn’t just about the litter in the water but also the inability of the town to handle waste.

Ha Long Bay is a UNESCO world heritage site. I’ve visited many such sites across the world and this one was of of the most abysmal in terms of how it’s taken care of. I don’t believe there is any *sustainable* limit on the number of tourists. What is the daily limit anyway? Other places enforce a limit. Why don’t you? And no, it’s not about buying a ticket to access it lol. Yes, we know tickets need to be bought. But what’s the limit? 

Even if there was 0 litter in the water, everything he said above applies. You have to realize that the stakes are higher for such a valuable, beautiful piece of nature. A lot of the damage will be irreversible. Tourism eventually will dry up too, and honestly it should. The bay should be given a chance to heal and regenerate.

Lastly, I’m no expert on this but I personally felt bad for the floating fisherman villages. They had a whole lifestyle and culture and it’s been dismantled for the purpose of outsiders (tourists). Everyone can blame them all you want for the trash but why didn’t the government work with them and figure out a solution for the trash? It’s not like that’s the only community that’s littering. This is a problem all over Vietnam.",1,2025-04-12 18:44:36,Empty_Try8500

One is a three-story building with a swimming pool, likely for residential use, while the other is a seven-story commercial property.

You cannot compare a residential house to a commercial building that generates income. 

The Hollywood home is a single family unit and is classified as residential, it has one owner and one resident. Your Hanoi comparison looks like a commercial property with multiple units/tenants that generate income for the complex owner. For the owners of this property, it generates income.

I am beyond sick of the banking stuff every time my TRC expires, and my last two TRCs have only been 18 months because of some stuff with my employer and their own license. When I came here, TRCs were three years and could be extended.


Also completely sick of driving licenses being tied to TRCs. This basically guarantees you won't have a license for a couple of weeks even if you do everything perfectly. Having to provide a medical is sort of understandable, but why does converting a foreign license require proof of where you live from your local police? I am in a police station converting a license, and have to go to another police station to get this document, when it is completely irrelevant and they could just look it up in the database themselves. Mindless pointless bureaucracy.


There are still enormous shortcomings in all of the work stuff. An employer can cancel your WP and TRC without even telling you and just land you in a world of hurt. Why don't we get a letter or an SMS when our status changes, when it is out of our hands completely? We are supposed to have worker rights but are given like 1-2 weeks to leave the country even if we've been here decades.



It is a country that deep down doesn't think we should have any semblance of equal rights. Even Vietnamese people who like foreigners etc. don't actually think we should be able to get the same rights that they would get in our countries.

I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don’t smoke, but I occasionally drink. I’m in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning.

I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I’m trying to explain that I’m a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness.

VietNam,1jugrn7,mm2jycw,"I'm no foreigner so I can't say for sure about travel costs, visa, etc but you better get these things sort out now if you want to move in the next month.

So here's some guideline for you to survive with 400USD/months \~ around 10 million VND so you can still have money to do everything else.

10M/months are around 1 freshly graduated - junior office income here and most Vietnamese in big cities from 22-26 are earning this amount and live perfectly alone, so you should too.

Firstly, you should stay in big cities like Saigon, Hanoi, Danang or a tourist attraction place, it's more pricey but you'll manage. You can live in rural provinces for the cheapest options., but your life will be hell and nobody around you will speak English so I won't recommend it.

I live in Vinhomes Grand Park Saigon, there's a pretty good balance of foreigner and locals here, the prices below are what I spend as well.

For rent, if you want some comfort, you can find an affordable studio around 4 million, with electricity, internet and every other household bill it would cost up to total around 5.5 million.

Or, you can live in a sleepbox, renting room(phòng trọ). it can cost as cheap as 2 to 2.5 million.

Let's say you live in a studio in Vinhomes, now you have around 4 to 4.5 million left to spend on food and everything.

You can eat out everyday, here's some average prices per food you can select.

Banh Mi/Banh Cuon and many other light breakfasts - 20k-25k

Pho/Bun Bo/Com Tam 35k-40k-45k

So if you ear reallly fancy it can take upo to 120k/day. mutliply it with 30days is equal to 3.6M. and you still have around 1-1.5 millions left to have fun, buy clothes, go gym things, explore, etc.

But you can still save much more money if you decide to cook. For example 1kg of chicken breast here is 80k VND.",25,2025-04-08 17:45:49,Undersword

The name sounds like something from an ancient Chinese classic called 山海經 about the geography of a somewhat imaginary ancient world. But I didn’t find it in it.

Coffee: we're like number 2 or 3 exporter of coffee, so possibly a part of the coffee the world drinks come from Vietnam.

But maybe the exposure to the abundant surply of various type of coffee is overwhelming.

Air polution: In big city, it's a problem too hard to solve. I'm running away from it to the beaches for more fresh air. And so hanoi and hochiminh city aren't great destination for tourist. But some of your destinations are places even the local want to go to.

VietNam,1jyv8xi,mn1lrbz,"Yeah, there have been many awkward moments over the years. It's a challenge to go work out without people constantly disturbing me. 

I've never felt unsafe though, so big picture, it's pretty far down my list of problems. 

Speaking Vietnamese and going to the same places over and over helps. People get used to you. Eventually the only people that talk to you are the staff and maybe some older retirees. I also cultivate a reputation for being unbelievably boring, but that takes years to spread through a neighborhood.

Anyway, there's a koan in Zen Buddhism ""If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him"". So, it could have turned out worse, am I right? :P",5,2025-04-14 11:25:42,Saigonauticon

VietNam,1jy3fee,mmvk40a,"The comments above have already explained this ""tradition"" quite clearly. 

I just want to add that things are changing, especially among younger couples. Many of them now understand and respect the importance of having control over their own earnings.

My sister is a good example. She and her husband agreed on a financial plan that works for both of them:

- Housing Fund: Each contributes 50% of their salary toward saving for a future home.

- Household Fund: 20% of their income goes toward groceries, bills, petrol, and other shared expenses.

- Personal Fund: The remaining amount is theirs to spend however they wish. My sister enjoys shopping, while her husband spends his on games and hobbies.

The proportions are flexible and adjusted based on their priorities and individual income levels at any given time.

This financial setup allows them to show commitment to each other while keeping things transparent, fair, and well-organized.",6,2025-04-13 10:46:37,Significant-Pick4526
VietNam,1jy3fee,mmvcizc,I have a Vietnamese wife and I am white American and this was a big issue in our relationship. I never expected this. But to be honest it’s working out really well. My wife is super good with money and doesn’t give me shit about spending. We only use 1 credit card or cash and she handles the bills. I resisted a lot in the beginning and just gave in because I was tired of hearing questions about where my money is.  I said. You handle it. And we are much happier now. But. Trust is a big thing for her.  And she said it’s her responsibility to manage the money end of conversation.,16,2025-04-13 09:26:13,Hardcut1278

VietNam,1jxever,mmqweuw,"I find it sad Vietnam’s economy and its 100 million citizens future are linked so much to Samsung, a giant foreign conglomerate.  It’s shameful Vietnam has allowed itself to be in the same situation as that of South Korea in giving Samsung so much power. 

Once labour cost goes up, Samsung will relocate to a different country again. The Vietnamese people and Vietnam’s future isn’t a priority for Samsung, it’s the cheap labour and profit margins that matters more as per evidence. 

Literally, “Vietnams development is intertwined with Samsung. When Vietnam succeeds, Samsung Succeeds” is so dystopian to read. It’s sad. This is not something to celebrate. It’s not a victory for Vietnam to be in such a predicament. 

We don’t even know how much influence this conglomerate has over the VCP leaderships either. But I’m willing to bet, a lot of favourable concessions were made cuz some VCP member got some nice pocket money. 

Going forward, I really hope the VCP leadership will work on reducing the market share that Samsungs has on Vietnams economy. 

They should really invest and support native tech and other private Vietnamese businesses to help them grow and be more competent so they can help out too. 

I’m not against Samsung investing in Vietnam, I’m against how much power Samsung has in Vietnam. I would love to see Vietnamese enterprises contribution go the economy grow so we can reduce our reliance on Samsung and other foreign businesses. 

Trump will impact Vietnams economy for sure, but he’s not to blame entirely. He simply woke up Vietnam to the reality its domestic economy is still pathetic since his first term in office.",-2,2025-04-12 15:32:43,greenie1996
