Abstract

Pediatric traumatic brain injury (pTBI) can lead to considerable mortality, morbidity, mental impairment, and physical disability over time. The direct impact of pTBI on educational attainment is unclear. We included all pediatric 0- to 17-year-old patients who were at least 26 years old at the end of the follow-up with a diagnosis of TBI in the Finnish Care Registry for Health Care (years 1998 to 2018) to form our study group (pTBI group). The reference group comprised patients with ankle and wrist fractures. The pTBI group was further divided into concussions and specific intracranial injuries. We compared this information to Statistics Finland´s Degree/Qualification data to evaluate educational attainment at 3 main levels. All comparisons were made using logistic regression with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The pTBI group comprised 8 487 patients and the reference group comprised 15,552 patients. In total, 7594 pTBI patients had a concussion and 892 a specific intracranial injury. The pTBI group had lower odds of attaining any tertiary education compared with the reference group (odds ratio [OR] 0.85; CI 0.80, 0.90). The pTBI group was also more likely to remain at a lower tertiary education than attain higher tertiary education (OR 0.81; CI 0.74, 0.87). Patients with specific intracranial injuries were more likely not to attain any tertiary education compared to patients with concussions (OR 0.78; CI 0.68, 0.90). People with pTBI had lower educational attainment at all higher educational levels than the reference population with ankle and wrist injuries.

From the linked article: 

One mild childhood concussion cuts likelihood of higher education by 15%

A new study has found that a kid who has suffered a concussion – even a mild one – is 15% less likely to go on to higher education in adulthood. It highlights the long-term impact of traumatic brain injury on learning, regardless of severity.

The long-lasting effects of concussion on the brain have become increasingly evident in recent years, highlighted by scientific research. Much of that research relates to traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) sustained during adult contact sports. When it comes to kids, though, there can be a fair bit of inadvertent head-bumping outside the sporting field.

The researchers found that kids with pTBI were about 15% less likely to go on to any kind of tertiary education, like university or college, than the reference group. Compared to the reference group, those with a pTBI were about 19% more likely to stay at a lower level of tertiary education, such as a diploma or lower-level degree, instead of moving to a higher level. When the two pTBI groups were compared, perhaps unsurprisingly, children with specific intracranial injuries were about 22% more likely to not attain any tertiary education compared to kids with a concussion.",2025-03-29 10:40:53,35,mvea,science

“Turning right”? An experimental study on the political value shift in large language models

Abstract

Constructing artificial intelligence that aligns with human values is a crucial challenge, with political values playing a distinctive role among various human value systems. In this study, we adapted the Political Compass Test and combined it with rigorous bootstrapping techniques to create a standardized method for testing political values in AI. This approach was applied to multiple versions of ChatGPT, utilizing a dataset of over 3000 tests to ensure robustness. Our findings reveal that while newer versions of ChatGPT consistently maintain values within the libertarian-left quadrant, there is a statistically significant rightward shift in political values over time, a phenomenon we term a ‘value shift’ in large language models. This shift is particularly noteworthy given the widespread use of LLMs and their potential influence on societal values. Importantly, our study controlled for factors such as user interaction and language, and the observed shifts were not directly linked to changes in training datasets. While this research provides valuable insights into the dynamic nature of value alignment in AI, it also underscores limitations, including the challenge of isolating all external variables that may contribute to these shifts. These findings suggest a need for continuous monitoring of AI systems to ensure ethical value alignment, particularly as they increasingly integrate into human decision-making and knowledge systems.

From the linked article: 

ChatGPT is shifting rightwards politically

An examination of a large number of ChatGPT responses found that the model consistently exhibits values aligned with the libertarian-left segment of the political spectrum. However, newer versions of ChatGPT show a noticeable shift toward the political right. The paper was published in Humanities & Social Sciences Communications.

The results showed that ChatGPT consistently aligned with values in the libertarian-left quadrant. However, newer versions of the model exhibited a clear shift toward the political right. Libertarian-left values typically emphasize individual freedom, social equality, and voluntary cooperation, while opposing both authoritarian control and economic exploitation. In contrast, economic-right values prioritize free market capitalism, property rights, and minimal government intervention in the economy.

“This shift is particularly noteworthy given the widespread use of LLMs and their potential influence on societal values. Importantly, our study controlled for factors such as user interaction and language, and the observed shifts were not directly linked to changes in training datasets,” the study authors concluded.",2025-03-28 16:46:14,1440,mvea,science

mk8jlih,1jlzgub,reddit,">Related research indicates that more recent versions of ChatGPT exhibit a more neutral attitude compared to earlier iterations, likely due to updates in its training corpus (Fujimoto and Takemoto 2023). The study demonstrated a significant reduction in political bias through political orientation tests. For instance, in the IDRLabs political coordinates test, the current version of ChatGPT showed near-neutral political tendencies (2.8% right-wing and 11.1% liberal), whereas earlier versions displayed a more pronounced left-libertarian orientation (~30% left-wing and ~45% liberal). This shift may be attributed to OpenAI’s efforts to diversify the training data and refine the algorithms to mitigate biases toward specific political stances.

If you read their results, it shows ChatGPT going from being very libleft towards centrism. The headline is misleading in that reading it, you’d think ChatGPT is now in a right quadrant. When this is not the case.",2025-03-28 19:28:33,50,Cute-Contract-6762,science

mk7zr8f,1jlzgub,reddit,"Interesting study - I see a few red flags tho, worth pointing out.

1. They used single conversation to ask multiple questions. - LLMs are bias machines, your previous rounds inputs can bias potential outputs, especially if a previous question or response was strongly biased in one political direction or another. It always makes me question 'long form conversation' studies. I'd be much more curious what their results would test out to using 1 shot responses.

2. They did this testing on ChatGPT, not on the gpt API - This means they're dealing with a system message and systems integration waaay beyond the actual model, and any potential bias could be just as much front end pre-amble instruction ('attempt to stay neutral in politics') as inherent model bias. 

Looking at their diagrams, they all show a significant shift towards center. I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing from a political/economic standpoint (but doesn't make as gripping of a headline).  I want my LLMs neutral, not leaning one way or another preferably. 

I tune and test LLMs professionally. While I don't 100% discount this study, I see major problems that make me question the validity of their results, especially around bias (not the human kind, the token kind)",2025-03-28 17:50:34,117,SanDiegoDude,science

Abstract

Prejudices intercorrelate positively and can be modeled as a generalized prejudice (GP) factor that is considered robust and central to postulating that some people are relatively more prejudiced than others (i.e., prejudice is not purely contextual). Although past research documents changes in specific prejudices over time, the field tacitly assumes GP stability/robustness, an untested notion. Using nationally representative American National Election Survey 2004–2020 data (N = 21,998) assessing attitudes toward Black people, illegal immigrants, gay people, and feminists, we discovered that prejudices have become increasingly correlated over time. Initially invariant, from 2012 onward GP became variant and required correlated residuals between prejudices (outside of GP). GP vastly increased its association with political conservatism (≈.41 in 2004–2008, ≈.70 by 2016–2020) but less so with age, sex, and education. Indeed, best fit in 2020 involved a “GP 2.0” factor indicated by specific prejudices and conservatism. Implications regarding the nature of prejudice are discussed.

From the linked article: 

Political conservatism increasingly linked to generalized prejudice in the United States

People who hold negative attitudes toward one marginalized group are increasingly likely to express prejudice toward others as well, according to a new study published in Social Psychological and Personality Science. The research shows that generalized prejudice in the United States has grown stronger and more politically aligned over the past two decades.

One of the most striking findings was how much more strongly generalized prejudice became linked to political conservatism over time. In 2004 and 2008, the association between generalized prejudice and conservatism was moderate, around .40. By 2016 and 2020, that correlation had risen to approximately .70.

That means people who identified as more conservative were much more likely than in the past to express a broad range of prejudicial attitudes. This trend was not mirrored for other demographic variables: the associations between generalized prejudice and factors like age, education, and sex remained relatively stable over time.",2025-04-20 12:04:18,17,mvea,science

Abstract

In the first decades of the twentieth century, the gap in age-adjusted mortality rates between people living in Republican and Democratic counties expanded; people in Democratic counties started living longer. This paper argues that political partisanship poses a direct problem for ameliorating these trends: trust and adherence in one’s personal doctor (including on non-COVID-19 related care) – once a non-partisan issue – now divides Democrats (more trustful) and Republicans (less trustful). We argue that this divide is largely a consequence of partisan conflict surrounding COVID-19 that spilled over and created a partisan cleavage in people’s trust in their own personal doctor. We then present experimental evidence that sharing a political background with your medical provider increases willingness to seek care. The doctor-patient relationship is essential for combating some of society’s most pressing problems; understanding how partisanship shapes this relationship is vital.

From the linked article: 

Democrats are more likely to trust their personal doctors and follow their doctors’ advice than Republicans, new research from the University of Oregon finds.

The findings have implications for personal and public health, as well as the practice of medicine in the United States.

Patients who trust their doctors are more likely to follow their doctor’s guidance on everything from managing diabetes to getting regular colon screenings, which improves health, various studies have shown.

“The big takeaway from our research is that after the COVID-19 pandemic, not only are the left and right divided on COVID-19 health matters, they’re also divided on trust in their own doctor and following their doctor’s advice about their health conditions,” O’Brian said. “This broader polarization about trust in medicine has trickled down to trust in your personal doctor to treat, in some cases, your chronic illnesses.”

That’s alarming because life expectancy has stagnated in the United States and declined in the early 2020s, O’Brian said.

Between 2001 and 2019, scholars also identified a growing gap in death rates between people living in Republican and Democratic-leaning counties. Residents of Democratic counties were living longer.  

“If people don’t trust medical institutions or health professionals, then it makes it harder to solve health problems and could potentially exacerbate them,” O’Brian said.

Next, the researchers investigated how much a doctor’s political affiliation mattered to patients. It turned out to carry a lot of weight.",2025-04-04 19:01:43,50,mvea,science

I had an aunt go full-on coo coo about 5 to 10 years back after my grandfather, her dad died in a hospital room. She always had been more on homeopathic stuff but she was soon saying that chi healers and crystals would help her better than anything. Positive vibes and ivermectin and the stuff. She had hip problems for years but it bound her to a wheelchair after a while. Her solution was a medicine man in Oklahoma to dance around her with a feather and special edible clay from Texas. Finally she was forced into the hospital after the pain made her pass out in church. They did all the tests on her and it was cancer. Not just in her hip but it had spread all over her body. For years she had just lived with an unbearable hip pain and didn't ever get it checked out. Thoughts and prayers were her hope and medicine. She was fully in the sauce of ""biden is the devil and trump is gonna round up the democrats into camps rightfully so"" type stuff. 

This was not the aunt I used to know and love. She used to be kind and caring and generous. But due to the environment (rural Arkansas), party ran media, and the conspiracies on the internet, she had become a hateful terrible person. 

After the diagnosis, she had been given weeks. She cried and cried wishing she could have all taken it back and been a smarter person. I told her that every family member at one point or another had recommended she see a doctor for years. Decades ago, she had cancer and had treatment for it, she knew she had an increased likelihood for it. Yet all I can think about are the shamans and ""alternative medicine"" doctors that charged her tens of thousands for glorified vibe healing.

She died two years ago and I hate alternative medicine and all who practice it with an unquenchable fire. Homeopathics and the like have their place but sometimes cancer is cancer. No amount of mint extract or mineral-enriched red clay is gonna save you. 

I loved my aunt and miss her terribly. I remember the doctors telling her that it could have been very treatable if she had come in when her hip was first hurting. The cancer had taken her lungs and stomach, she could hardly breathe and couldn't keep anything down. She literally starved to death in her early 50's to her own ignorance and stubbornness.

Abstract

It is often assumed that, if given the choice, people would prefer not to be gossiped about. We address this assumption by investigating reactions to gossip from the perspective of its potential targets. In two nationally representative samples, we assess whether people are ever open to being the topic of other people’s gossip and find a general aversion to being talked about, unless positively. However, some people reliably do prefer to be the focus of gossip: a meta-analytic summary showed that being male and more narcissistic predicted a greater desire to be the focus of gossip, even when that gossip is negative. And, older adults had a lower desire to be positively gossiped about. We also test in confirmatory experiments whether people correctly perceive others’ preferences and find that people overestimate the extent to which others want to be gossiped about, but only when the gossip is positive.

From the linked article: 

Most people dislike being gossiped about—except narcissistic men, who welcome even negative gossip

In a surprising twist to conventional wisdom, new research published in Self & Identity finds that while most people dislike being gossiped about, certain individuals—particularly men and those with narcissistic traits—actually welcome becoming the subject of others’ conversations, even when the gossip is negative.

The results consistently showed most people preferred not to be gossiped about, especially negatively. However, significant variations emerged across all five studies. The research found that 64% of participants preferred positive gossip to not being mentioned at all. Surprisingly, 36% would rather be left out of conversations entirely, even when the gossip was positive. A notable 15% reported preferring negative gossip over being ignored completely.

Individual characteristics strongly influenced these preferences. Men consistently showed more openness to being gossiped about than women, particularly when the gossip was ambiguous or negative. Younger participants embraced positive gossip more readily than older individuals. People with narcissistic traits reported significantly higher preference for being discussed, even negatively. Those experiencing chronic social exclusion showed greater willingness to be gossiped about generally, though they paradoxically desired positive gossip less.

Overall, this study challenges our assumptions about gossip’s universal undesirability. While most people prefer privacy, certain individuals—particularly men, younger adults, and those with narcissistic tendencies—appear to view gossip as validation of their social significance, regardless of whether the talk is positive or negative.",2025-03-26 12:05:05,1,mvea,science

My co-author, Dr. Jennifer Watling Neal (u/jennawneal), and I used data from the US National Survey of Family Growth from 2002 to 2023, to track different types of non-parents over time. “Not yet parents” who plan to have children in the future are the most common, but are becoming less common. “Childfree” people who do not want children are the second most common, and are becoming more common. Additionally, there are more than three times more people who are childfree than who are “childless” (wanted but can't have children).

They're expensive at a time when finances are already tight. They take up enormous amounts of time when people already feel like they have very little to spare. Children are often exhausting at a time when we are historically burnt out. Kids require patience at a time when anger, depression, and despair are at a high. It used to take a village, but that village doesn't exist anymore. You want your children to have a bright future when we live in a time of bleakness (climate change, conflict, authoritarianism, etc).

That's all anecdotal, from what I've observed and what my peers who have kids have said to me. I suspect that a lot of these reasons have combined to create the overall atmosphere we see today.

mm8fis6,1jv9ay2,reddit,"In the past, people had children because it was socially expected to do so (and there was a social penalty for not doing so, either being pitied for your inability to do so or being looked down on for your refusal to do your duty to society, God, etc.). Or they did it because they needed the help, whether on the farm or going to work to help support the family or to have people to care for you in your old age. Or, very often, they did it because there were no effective contraceptives and they had no choice. 

Today none of those are really true, at least not in the West. You can live a perfectly full life without children without being looked down upon, you don't need the help on the farm anymore, and it's frowned upon to have children to support you in old age (not to mention awfully impractical since few children actually do this anymore), and effective contraceptives are widely available, even permanent ones. 

  
Instead, having children requires enormous financial, physical, and emotional investment with really no other pay off than personal satisfaction. So the real question is, why IS anyone choosing to have children anymore?",2025-04-09 16:15:33,179,yourlittlebirdie,science

I regret having a kid.

It is a tireless, thankless, costly, time consuming job.

We have less money, less freedom, less everything.

And it's not that our son isn't *worth it*, it's not that I don't get joy out of being with him. It's more like, the coat and benefits aren't in the same axis, or even the same chart. The pros don't outweigh the cons because they are apples to oranges. So instead, both the pros and cons exist at the same time, which is not exactly a great place to be: I look at my son and feel love and at the same time feel the pain of what I've lost since he was born.

In my own experience over thousands of photoshoots and more than two decades of talking with men and women I've photographed, men do generally find natural lips far more attractive and worse, women often complain that they don't think their own injections look great but they continue to have them done due to peer pressure or feeling like they have to stay ""young"" looking for as long as possible. I don't know how they came to equate bigger lips with youth, but I'm sure there's some advertising influence in that conversation somewhere.

https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2025.0202

Abstract

Perceiving faces as attractive or not guides decisions to approach or date a person and can sway opinions in recruiting and legal proceedings. However, the mechanisms underlying facial attractiveness are not fully understood. While popular models of face recognition emphasize holistic processing, individuals often attempt to enhance their own attractiveness in feature-centric ways (cosmetic surgery, make-up, injectables). Here, we use a local feature manipulation (lip expansion/contraction) and show that it alters the perceived attractiveness of male and female faces. Females showed peak preference for expanded lips when viewing female faces; males showed peak preference for contracted lips when viewing male faces. Distortions of lip size therefore mostly influence own-gender attractiveness ratings. Next, we tested whether visual adaptation to expanded or contracted lips would bias subsequent attractiveness judgements, and found peak attractiveness shifted towards the adapted lip size (e.g. expanded lips were preferred following exposure to expanded lips). Viewing faces with artificially altered lip size therefore powerfully influences attractiveness judgements. Outside the laboratory, cosmetic procedures to increase lip size are popular. Our findings indicate that (i) lip plumping will mostly appeal to women rather than men (who prefer thinner lips), and (ii) exposure to expanded lips renormalizes attractiveness to a larger baseline and may lead to lip dysmorphia.

From the linked article: 

A new study by psychologists has shed light on the way lip size could influence perceptions of facial attractiveness.

Led by Professor David Alais in the School of Psychology at the University of Sydney, researchers have uncovered gender-specific biases and the potential influence of cosmetic procedures on Western perceptions of beauty.

The study used digitally created images (above) to display altered lip size on both male- and female-appearing faces and asked participants to rate their attractiveness. The results showed a difference in preference for lip size that was dependent on recent experience and some surprising gender differences.

The findings are published today in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

Main findings

Overall findings: Pooling all observers, the highest ratings were for male images with thinner lips and female images with plumper lips.

Gendered preferences: Female participants showed an even stronger preference for plumper lips when viewing images of female faces, while male participants preferred female faces with unaltered lips. This suggests that attractiveness judgments are shaped by the observer's own gender.

The adaptation effect: Exposure to a face with lips altered to be plumper or thinner influenced subsequent attractiveness judgements of new faces. Exposure to plump lips led to future higher ratings for faces with plump lips, and exposure to thin lips led to future higher ratings for thin-lipped faces. Psychologists have seen this adaptation effect influence visual preference for a range of stimuli, from art to food preference.

Lips in isolation: Interestingly, the study found that adaptation to lips alone, without the context of the whole face, also produced shifts in attractiveness ratings, suggesting that lip size is encoded by the brain as a distinct feature, separate from the overall facial structure.",2025-04-09 02:22:17,7,mvea,science

This reminds a whole lot of the culture around muscle building in the masculine hierarchy where men often judge each other based on size. This results in the ideal size of a man, among other men, to become far far greater than the size preference according to women. 

We don't get swole for women, we get swole for other men, which elevates us in the masculine hierarchy making us more confident and socially secure, which in turn attracts women. 

I guess my conclusion then would be that lip size equates to status in a feminine (mating?) hierarchy, leading to greater confidence, and thus attraction.

mmjm45s,1jwne09,reddit,"New Health Policy analysis ‘Protecting Africa's children from extreme risk: a runway of sustainability for PEPFAR programmes’ published in The Lancet, estimates that 1 million children could become infected with HIV, nearly half a million could die from AIDS by 2030, and 2.8 million children could experience orphanhood in the region without consistent, stable funding for US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) programmes.

The authors say their analysis presents strong evidence that funding PEPFAR programmes for at least five more years is critically important to prevent childhood illness, death, and orphanhood, maintain progress in efforts to prevent new HIV infections worldwide, and uphold the USA’s position as a leader in global health diplomacy.   

Co-lead author Professor Lucie Cluver said: 'The future of PEPFAR programmes hang in the balance. Losing stable, long-term support for PEPFAR programmes sets global progress to end HIV/AIDS back to the dark ages of the epidemic, especially for children and adolescents.'

mmsqd5c,1jwne09,reddit,"I don’t think people remember how superpowers work? They participate in foreign aid to increase their sphere of influence and /sometimes/ for the good of humanity. The goal is dependency. Once you get a whole continent dependent on your resources, the continent has to do what you say. And if you have a government that doesn’t care about the longevity of the country, then once the aid is gone, you are doomed to failure. The working class in these countries are nowhere near being powerful enough to overthrow their government. Also, majority of the countries affected are largely practising Christian, so they are more likely to conform rather than fight back against class oppression.

The silly thing is that people act like this is just exclusive to Africa, it’s not. The economic activity in prosperous cities/regions will always be used to supplement people living elsewhere. If you earn a low wage, it doesn’t matter how hard you work, the people earning more are “paying” for your infrastructure and access to resources. If that wasn’t the case everywhere, governments would not exist.

To extend your power over a region and then pull the rug whenever you please is simply evil because now the problem is worse than it was when it started. Even if the country found the resources at one point and handle it themselves, they are no longer able to anymore because the funds are being allocated elsewhere. As said before, all countries would have been better off if they were never made to depend on the “altruism” of others in the first place.

https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19485565.2024.2422850

Abstract 

China’s fertility rate continues to decline despite government fertility policies. This study aims to explore the micro-level causes of China’s declining fertility rate by examining the impact of changes in Chinese work patterns in recent years, particularly the prevalence of overtime work, on fertility intentions. Using data from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), this study examines the impact of overtime work on fertility intentions at both the provincial and urban levels. It also examines the specific mechanisms through which different types of overtime (e.g. weekend overtime, night shifts, on-call duty) affect fertility intentions. The results show that overtime work significantly inhibits fertility intentions, a trend that is consistent at both provincial and urban levels. Weekend overtime, night shifts, and on-call duties exhibit particularly pronounced inhibitory effects on fertility intentions. However, not all work arrangements negatively impact fertility intentions. Reasonable work schedules may even foster them. The research implies the need for policy measures to mitigate the negative effects of overtime work on fertility intentions.

From the linked article: 

A demanding work culture could be quietly undermining efforts to raise birth rates

China’s falling birth rate has become a major national concern, and a new study published in Biodemography and Social Biology suggests that the country’s demanding work culture may be partly to blame. The research shows that working more than 40 hours a week significantly reduces people’s desire to have children. Overtime, night shifts, and being constantly on call make it harder for people to imagine balancing work and family life — a finding that has important implications for future population policies.

The results were clear: overtime work had a strong and statistically significant negative effect on fertility intentions. This pattern held across nearly every province and city analyzed. The more hours people worked beyond the standard 40-hour week, the less likely they were to say they planned to have children in the near future. This trend was especially pronounced for people working 40–50 hours per week, where fertility intentions dropped the most sharply. Those working more than 60 hours a week showed more varied responses, but the overall effect was still negative.

When the researchers broke down working hours into smaller segments, they found that moderate work schedules — especially those between 0 and 20 hours per week — were actually associated with higher fertility intentions. Between 20 and 40 hours, the effect was mixed: some people were more willing to have children as hours increased, while others were not. But once work passed the 40-hour threshold, the negative effects on fertility became much stronger.

The type of overtime also mattered. People who regularly worked on weekends, at night, or were expected to be reachable 24/7 were significantly less likely to plan for children. These types of schedules interfere not just with physical rest, but also with family and social life. Weekend work and night shifts disrupt routines, reduce time with partners, and can create chronic fatigue. Being constantly on-call added another layer of stress, keeping people mentally tethered to their jobs even during off hours. The authors suggest that this erosion of personal time leaves little room for planning or raising a family.

There were also differences based on gender and marital status. Women showed a stronger negative response to overtime than men, suggesting that long hours may be especially burdensome for women who still shoulder more of the childcare and household responsibilities. Unmarried individuals were also more affected than those who were already married, possibly because they are still in the phase of life where fertility decisions are more flexible.",2025-04-01 10:03:48,37,mvea,science

I've seen people who couldn't stop puking handling ready-to-eat food. I've also never seen anyone wash produce AT ALL and gloves have made everything far worse because nobody washes their hands anymore. They also stay understaffed to save money.

Meanwhile at high end restaurants we were overstaffed, given free meals, and being genuinely sick wasn't a possible firing. Working at a fancy dinner place and I was paid well and happy to work. Working at fast food I was once fired because a snow storm knocked out the power, we were closed and I called DAILY to see if we were open (I worked evenings) after three days the ice and snow were good enough I could safely get into town and noticed they were open, went inside and was told I was fired for a no-call no-show and mentioned I had called every day around 9am, I was told ""oh yeah the phone lines are down"".

The manager didn't even attempt to call me when I didn't show up. At my sit-down restuarant job I was told to take all the time I needed to recover when I went to the hospital. There's such a disconnect.

Fast food is also disgusting. Mold everywhere, being told by managers to ignore the temp times because food waste hurt our bottom line, etc,.

They essentially told me it didn't matter and I would be required to work until I received my results or face disciplinary action. I worked during one of the absolute busiest times of the year interacting with people in the drive thru window.

They told the DM later that I was deathly ill and refusing to leave the store, which ??? (Had screenshot proof otherwise thankfully.)  Essentially I found out afterwards the reason they wouldn't let me leave is they were saying that people were abusing Covid Quarantine for a free vacation, so they just weren't going to let people use it. They do not care.

Anal sex/pegging is tied to anal cancer because of the physical wear and tear placed on the anus. 

Choking is not only deadly but can also cause brain damage in even mild play. 

Latex (which is a favorite of mine) comes with risks because people love to use spray-shiner and spray-on dressing aid instead of hand-polishing, which means you're inhaling aerosolized petrochemical lubricants.  And someone who licks and kisses freshly-shined latex is ingesting petrochemical lubricant.

Sounding can block things and create retrograde ejaculation which is not only insanely painful but very dangerous.

mlum4at,1jtjjrb,reddit,"I’ve linked to the news release in the post above. In this comment, for those interested, here’s the link to the peer reviewed journal article: 

https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-025-03097-3

From the linked article: 

Abstract

Despite its potentially fatal consequences, sexual choking/strangulation is an increasingly common sexual practice. Existing research suggests that its growing prevalence is partly a consequence of its popular construction as “risky yet safe.” Few studies have directly examined how people frame and engage in choking/strangulation in terms of “safety”—what people think it means for strangulation to be (or not be) “safe” and how people think safety during strangulation can be achieved. Drawing on qualitative text responses from a survey collected in 2023, this paper examined whether and how Australian adults aged between 18–35 perceived choking/strangulation in terms of “safety.” We identified and discussed four main themes arising from the data: choking/strangulation during sex can be safe; pressure/intensity is a safety mechanism; consent is a safety mechanism; and trust and communication are necessary. In consideration of these themes, we suggest that many Australian young people are not aware of the risks of choking/strangulation during sex and frequently equate pressure/intensity and consent, within a trusting relationship, with safety. Given the significant risks and harms associated with any sexual choking/strangulation and the resultant difficulty in achieving safe use, we concluded that appropriate education and information should be provided to young people.

From the linked article: 

Choking during sex: many young people mistakenly believe it can be done safely, our study shows

Around 50% of Australian young people have engaged in choking, or strangulation, during sex. This practice involves one person putting pressure on the neck of another, restricting breathing or blood flow (or both).

Strangulation during sex carries a variety of risks. These range from effects such as bruising and vomiting to brain injury and death.

Although rare, strangulation is the leading cause of death in consensual BDSM play.

There’s no evidence there is any safe way to undertake strangulation. Notably, strangulation can cause injury without leaving any marks and sometimes negative consequences don’t develop until well after the choking episode.

In a new study, we’ve found part of the reason why strangulation during sex is so common may be because many people mistakenly believe that, while risky, it can be made safe through moderating pressure and appropriate communication.

But stopping blood flow to the brain can take less pressure than opening a can of soft drink. And research shows strangulation can result in serious harms even when it’s consensual.",2025-04-07 12:03:11,33,mvea,science

As a side note - other detection methods (like cologuard) are great because they increase access and make people more likely to at least get something to check for colorectal cancer. But no test other than colonoscopies have been proven to reduce risk of death from colon cancer.

Simple explanation - colonoscopies both detect AND remove pre-cancerous polyps before they become cancer. Cologuard detects large polyps that already have altered DNA - quite frequently these end up being cancerous by the time you get to the colonoscopy to investigate further. But generally if your cologuard is negative you can feel pretty reassured.

Abstract

Colorectal cancer incidence rates vary geographically and have changed over time1. Notably, in the past two decades, the incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer, affecting individuals under the age of 50 years, has doubled in many countries2-5. The reasons for this increase are unknown. Here, we investigate whether mutational processes contribute to geographic and age-related differences by examining 981 colorectal cancer genomes from 11 countries. No major differences were found in microsatellite unstable cancers, but variations in mutation burden and signatures were observed in the 802 microsatellite-stable cases. Multiple signatures, most with unknown etiologies, exhibited varying prevalence in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Russia, and Thailand, indicating geographically diverse levels of mutagenic exposure. Signatures SBS88 and ID18, caused by the bacteria-produced mutagen colibactin6,7, had higher mutation loads in countries with higher colorectal cancer incidence rates. SBS88 and ID18 were also enriched in early-onset colorectal cancers, being 3.3 times more common in individuals diagnosed before age 40 than in those over 70, and were imprinted early during colorectal cancer development. Colibactin exposure was further linked to APC driver mutations, with ID18 responsible for about 25% of APC driver indels in colibactin-positive cases. This study reveals geographic and age-related variations in colorectal cancer mutational processes, and suggests that early-life mutagenic exposure to colibactin-producing bacteria may contribute to the rising incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer.

From the linked article:

Childhood exposure to a toxin produced by bacteria in the bowel may be contributing to the rise of colorectal cancer in under-50s around the world, researchers say.

Countries, including some in Europe and Oceania, have witnessed an increase in young adults with bowel cancer in recent decades, with some of the steepest increases reported in England, New Zealand, Puerto Rico and Chile.

Doctors have pointed to soaring rates of obesity, widespread junk food and physical inactivity as potential drivers of the disease, but the new study finds that harmful strains of the common gut microbe E coli may be involved.

The scientists found that hallmark genetic mutations caused by colibactin, a toxin secreted by some harmful strains of E coli, were more than three times as common in tumours removed from patients under the age of 40 than in those from patients over 70. The same signature mutations were also more common in countries with the highest rates of early-onset bowel cancer, according to the study, which has been published in Nature.

The patterns of mutations are thought to arise when children are exposed to colibactin before the age of 10. The mutations disrupt DNA in cells in the colon and may raise the risk of developing bowel cancer before the age of 50.

Global health records show bowel cancer rates increasing in adults under 50 in at least 27 countries, with incidence roughly doubling every decade for the past 20 years. If the trend continues, bowel cancer could become be the leading cause of cancer death in that age group by 2030.",2025-04-23 21:31:42,278,mvea,science

*They found that a unique strain of E. coli bacteria, when paired with a diet low in carbs and soluble fibre, drives the growth of polyps in the colon, which can be a precursor to cancer. -* [*Article*](https://www.utoronto.ca/news/low-carb-diets-can-drive-development-colorectal-cancer-researchers-find)

They report it seems like without enough fiber the damaging bacteria types thrive producing more cancer causing compounds and without enough carbs your protective mucus membrane in your gut is weakened causing more damage from those compounds

So if you have the bad strains and have been on a low carb and low fiber diet as part of say a weight-loss diet it could be quite bad for your bowel health

One of the most reliable method is called FIT (fecal immunohistochemical test). It is a noninvasive test that has same specificity and sensitivity as colonoscopy. CRC screening should be looked at in a more holistic way towards individuals and also, the healthcare system. 1. Colonoscopy requires special preparation for the individual which requires bowel cleansing, which can be daunting. 2. Not all insurance policies cover colonoscopy, which can be expensive and thus, individuals may not adhere to the recommended screening schedules. 3. The biggest advantage if for the young onset or what we call “early-onset colorectal cancer” population. At present, colonoscopy is advised for individuals above 45 years. Those at possible high risk based on family history, history of diabetes or obesity (a major risk factor for early onset CRC) and younger than 45 years are not eligible for screening, but they can utilize FIT to assess their status. FIT is inexpensive and can be performed by individuals and if positive can be directed for colonoscopy.

As you can see, it deals with authoritarianism in the abstract sense of belief in hierarchies and the moral correctness of following authorities, it bares little resemblance to ""practical"" authoritarianism. All these statements are open-ended and theoretically achievable within the bounds of a modern liberal democracy, and I am sure that the people who agreed with them read them in the most charitable light possible.

If the paper's authors are genuinely trying to measure to what degree Trump supporters support anti-democratic and dictatorial politics, then there are far better questions that could be asked to measure support for authoritarian policies. Things like ""Media groups should be legally punished for biased reporting against our nation's leaders,"" or ""Too many people abuse free speech to preach destructive ideals that undermine our social fabric,"" or ""The police should swiftly crack down on potential riots rather than proportionally escalate use of force.""",2025-04-12 23:24:35,41,AdmiralAkbar1,science

From the linked article: 

A new study published in the Journal of Race, Ethnicity, and Politics challenges common assumptions about gender and racial group behavior in American politics. The researchers found that support for Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” (MAGA) agenda is strongly influenced by right-wing authoritarianism, but this influence varies depending on the race and gender of the voter. Notably, white women displayed levels of support for the MAGA agenda and authoritarian beliefs that closely resembled those of white men, while women of color were consistently the least supportive and least authoritarian.

The researchers found that support for the MAGA agenda differed significantly across race-gender lines. White men had the highest average support score, followed closely by men of color and white women, while women of color scored significantly lower. When looking at right-wing authoritarianism, white men and white women again had the highest levels, while women of color showed the lowest. Men of color showed mixed levels—high on some indicators of authoritarianism, but not others.

The most striking finding was that right-wing authoritarianism strongly predicted MAGA support for white men and white women, but not for women of color. This pattern remained even after controlling for political party, education, income, religiosity, racial resentment, and other factors. For men of color, the relationship between authoritarianism and MAGA support was present, but weaker and more inconsistent. The data suggested that women of color were the only group largely unaffected by authoritarian beliefs when it came to supporting the MAGA movement.

The researchers also found that social dominance orientation predicted MAGA support among both white and nonwhite women, suggesting that belief in group-based hierarchies can also shape political preferences, even among those structurally disadvantaged by them. However, system justification did not significantly affect MAGA support across any group. This suggests that the MAGA movement, with its revolutionary rhetoric and willingness to undermine democratic norms, is not driven by a desire to preserve the existing system but by an urge to restore a perceived lost social order.",2025-04-12 22:30:47,16,mvea,science

Authoritarian attitudes linked to altered brain anatomy, neuroscientists reveal

A new brain imaging study published in the journal Neuroscience has found that authoritarian attitudes on both the political left and right are linked to specific structural differences in the brain. Young adults who scored higher on right-wing authoritarianism had less gray matter volume in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, a region involved in social reasoning. Meanwhile, those who endorsed more extreme forms of left-wing authoritarianism showed reduced cortical thickness in the right anterior insula, a brain area tied to empathy and emotion regulation.

At the neural level, the researchers found two key structural associations. First, higher scores on right-wing authoritarianism were related to smaller gray matter volume in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. This region is known to be involved in understanding others’ perspectives, making moral judgments, and navigating complex social situations.

Second, individuals who scored high on the anti-hierarchical aggression component of left-wing authoritarianism showed lower cortical thickness in the right anterior insula. Interestingly, the same region has been implicated in studies examining reactions to political disagreement and emotional responses to moral violations.

To further validate their findings, the researchers examined whether these brain differences were also associated with related political ideologies. The gray matter reductions in the prefrontal cortex correlated with higher scores on social dominance orientation, a belief system often linked to right-wing authoritarianism. Likewise, the thinning in the anterior insula was related to endorsement of radical feminist views, which share ideological ground with the anti-authority stance of left-wing authoritarianism.",2025-04-19 10:05:38,48,mvea,science

mo42w2w,1k2swdk,reddit,"I'm feeling a bit skeptical of the idea of left-wing authoritarianism. The prevailing view for most of the last century is that it probably doesn't exist.

I followed the links in the article to [this study](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/3nprq_v1) which claims to identify it. I can see how some of their measures might indicate ""left wing"" authoritarianism, but I'm not convinced yet. One test statement, agreement with which is supposed to be an indicator, was ""all conservatives are fools.""

Sorry-not-sorry, but with almost a century of nearly unanimous research showing a profound negative correlation between conservatism and intelligence, I think to *disagree* with this claim would be a measure of ignorance. Or, to use some jargon, more a sign of social desirability bias than genuine insight. It's not authoritarianism. It's pattern recognition.

And although the paper itself clearly states that they're not claiming moral symmetry between ""right-"" and ""left-"" wing authoritarianism, headlines like this still give that tacit impression. This only fuels the misunderstandings that seem to be causing so many problems in the US and around the world.

I think, instead of contorting our political spectrum into the shape of a horseshoe just to seem maximally unbiased, it makes a lot more sense to understand conservatism as a psychological disposition that sometimes affects even people who vote with liberals.

Abstract

Do most couples who report high sexual frequency also report high relationship satisfaction? Are there happy sexless couples? In this study, we take a novel approach to investigating how sexual frequency and relationship satisfaction are intertwined by using latent profile analysis to identify subgroups of couples based on how frequently the couple has sex/sexual intercourse and the relationship satisfaction of both partners. We also test how demographic (age, relationship duration, raising young children) and relational (commitment, self-disclosure, conflict) covariates are associated with profile membership. Data came from 2,101 male–female couples (82.7% of males and 95.8% of females were young adults between the ages of 20–39 years) in the German Family Panel (pairfam) study. Results revealed that couples were classified into four distinct profiles. The majority of the sample (86.38%) occupied a profile in which both partners were highly satisfied and the couple had sex frequently (just less than once a week). The second profile was characterized by low relationship satisfaction for both partners and infrequent sex (less than 2–3 times per month; 3.60%). Two profiles had partners with discrepant levels of relationship satisfaction and a moderate sexual frequency (between two and three times per month and weekly): a satisfied female partner and highly dissatisfied male partner profile (4.01% of the sample) and a satisfied male partner and dissatisfied female partner profile (6.01%). The demographic covariates were rarely associated with class membership, but the relational covariate associations were robust. Couples with infrequent conflict and high levels of self-disclosure and commitment from both partners had higher odds of being in the highly satisfied and frequent sex profile compared to all other profiles.

From the linked article: 

Happy sexless couples exist—but they are very rare, according to new psychology research

A new study published in the Journal of Family Psychology finds that most male-female couples who are in satisfying relationships tend to engage in sexual activity close to once per week. Researchers identified four distinct patterns based on how often couples had sex and how satisfied they were with their relationships. The largest group—more than 85% of the sample—reported both high satisfaction and regular sex. Interestingly, a small number of couples were satisfied with their relationships but reported little to no sexual activity.

Four distinct profiles emerged. The first and by far the most common group, making up 86% of the sample, included couples who were both highly satisfied and reported having sex close to once a week. These couples also scored high on measures of commitment and emotional openness, and reported relatively few conflicts.

The second group, which included just 3.6% of couples, was the mirror image of the first: both partners were dissatisfied with the relationship and reported infrequent sex, averaging less than two or three times per month. Couples in this group tended to report more conflict, lower commitment, and less willingness to share personal thoughts and feelings with their partner.

The remaining 10% of couples were split into two groups characterized by mismatched satisfaction. One group consisted of couples where the female partner was satisfied and the male partner was highly dissatisfied. The other included couples with a satisfied male partner and a dissatisfied female partner. Interestingly, both of these groups reported a moderate level of sexual activity—more than two or three times per month but less than weekly.

Although the researchers expected to find a distinct group of “happy sexless couples,” no such profile emerged from the initial analysis. However, a closer look at the data revealed that they did exist—just in very small numbers. About 2.3% of couples reported no sex in the past three months but rated their relationship satisfaction as high. While this shows that it’s possible to have a satisfying relationship without regular sex, it appears to be uncommon, at least among young male-female couples.",2025-04-18 10:04:34,81,mvea,science

mnqkauq,1k219xv,reddit,"> When the researchers examined factors associated with each profile, they found that demographic characteristics like age, relationship length, and **having young children** had little predictive power.

(Bolding mine)

I'm having a very tough time believing that having young children has little predicting power in frequency regarding sex (and satisfaction for that matter). This jives very poorly with both my personal experience and any knowledge I have gleaned from parental information.

The professionals (when going through the pregnancy) are very careful in informing that the sexual experience will change. Potentially drastically.

> [Compared with community controls, new parents reported lower sexual satisfaction, lower sexual desire, and higher sexual distress at all time-points; however, these group differences became less pronounced by 12 months postpartum.](https://academic.oup.com/jsm/article-abstract/17/11/2156/6973750)

> [Postpartum sexual concerns are pervasive and moderately distressing in new parents. The increased frequency and severity of these concerns were associated with decreased relationship well-being in both members of the couple.](https://academic.oup.com/jsm/article-abstract/13/10/1455/6940371)

The most nuanced take I found (in my admittedly brief search) was:

> [... these results indicate that, for the majority of the interviewed couples, and despite the lower frequency of sexual relations during the TtoP and the lower sexual desire for mothers, the couple’s overall sexual satisfaction was not negatively affected by the TtoP.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14681994.2019.1675870?casa_token=kVRWUisph4oAAAAA%3AQSBEJ_sUJPRlBChsojgMiz3cu6ZbOnOYX_rNvVfA16o1jbJOP4T7wgUbac0D1JAILR_d2bgMLFqu#d1e942)

What i have read seems to vary greatly and shows that actually, it’s not really a one-size-fits-all for what a healthy & satisfying relationship looks like. Sexuality and relationship satisfaction seem to be on a spectrum, like most things. So what one couple finds satisfying for their relationship, another might find completely unsatisfying, etc.

I'm seeing a lot of comments referring to the 75% figure. That's not from the study. That's from a study from about 8 years ago that found that decline in a region of Germany that u/Snarfums already[ summarized here](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1k5cduz/insects_are_disappearing_at_an_alarming_rate/mohlulx/). That study got a lot of headlines, but it got extrapolated in the news to being all insects were declining by 75%. In reality is was much more varied when that study spurred more work on the subject. Some insects were just plain understudied, others definitely were decreasing, and some were actually increasing in abundance, but the main issue here is repeating the idea that populations worldwide have declined by 75%. We're definitely concerned about actual declines as entomologists, but that 75% number has led to a lot of misconceptions.

A similar thing happened here where the headline here mentioned that number. That was not the focus of the study. The researchers were using insect declines in general as a topic to work on figuring out underlying drivers. Here is what they focused on in this paper (from the summary article):

>To better understand the scientific community’s views more broadly, a team of researchers at Binghamton University analyzed more than 175 scientific reviews, which included 500+ hypotheses on different drivers of insect decline. Using this information, they created an interconnected network of 3,000 possible links, including everything from beekeeping to urban sprawl.

In other words, they were looking at all the reasons scientists have given that may be potential causes of insect declines. They weren't evaluating population changes, but instead creating a network or mapping out interrelated topics. From the abstract:

>Scientific and public interest in the global status of insects has surged recently; however, understanding the relative importance of different stressors and their interconnections remains a crucial problem. We use a meta-synthetic approach to integrate recent hypotheses about insect stressors and responses into a network containing 3385 edges and 108 nodes. The network is highly interconnected, with agricultural intensification most often identified as a root cause. Habitat-related variables are highly connected and appear to be underdiscussed relative to other stressors. We also identify biases and gaps in the recent literature, especially those generated from a focus on economically important and other popular insects, especially pollinators, at the expense of non-pollinating and less charismatic insects. In addition to serving as a case study for how meta-synthesis can map a conceptual landscape, our results identify many important gaps where future meta-analyses will offer critical insights into understanding and mitigating insect biodiversity loss.

Basically, this is a meta-analyses taking a highlighter to the current literature and saying not that certain areas are smoking guns for causes, but that those are areas that need particular attention and data for future research. It's more of a roadmap study for how us ecologists and entomologists can start sorting through a very complex topic that's been really tough for the public to get a handle on without jumping to conclusions like some of the stats presented being worldwide. Sometimes that takes away from how serious the issue is when us educators have to spend time on that misleading number and spend less time on what insects are having some major concerns right now.

The paper itself is paywalled unless you have university, etc. access, but the key thing through the paper is that they are evaluating how much particular ideas are **discussed** in the literature.

Abstract

Scientific and public interest in the global status of insects has surged recently; however, understanding the relative importance of different stressors and their interconnections remains a crucial problem. We use a meta-synthetic approach to integrate recent hypotheses about insect stressors and responses into a network containing 3385 edges and 108 nodes. The network is highly interconnected, with agricultural intensification most often identified as a root cause. Habitat-related variables are highly connected and appear to be underdiscussed relative to other stressors. We also identify biases and gaps in the recent literature, especially those generated from a focus on economically important and other popular insects, especially pollinators, at the expense of non-pollinating and less charismatic insects. In addition to serving as a case study for how meta-synthesis can map a conceptual landscape, our results identify many important gaps where future meta-analyses will offer critical insights into understanding and mitigating insect biodiversity loss.

Insects are disappearing due to agriculture – and many other drivers, new research reveals

New paper highlights 500+ interconnected drivers behind global insect decline

Insects are disappearing at an alarming rate worldwide, but why? Agricultural intensification tops the list of proposed reasons, but there are many other, interconnected drivers that have an impact, according to new research led by Binghamton University, State University of New York.

Research on insect decline has surged in recent years, sparked by an alarming 2017 study that suggested that insect populations had declined by 75% in less than three decades. This has led to countless published papers, with scientists hypothesizing different reasons for the decline.

To better understand the scientific community’s views more broadly, a team of researchers at Binghamton University analyzed more than 175 scientific reviews, which included 500+ hypotheses on different drivers of insect decline. Using this information, they created an interconnected network of 3,000 possible links, including everything from beekeeping to urban sprawl.

Examining the massive list of possible links, the most cited driver for insect decline was found to be agricultural intensification, via issues like land-use change and insecticides.",2025-04-22 17:39:50,49,mvea,science

mohlulx,1k5cduz,reddit,"I do not wish to downplay the insect apocalypse issue too much, but it is very important to be aware that the 75% number is based on a single study from protected areas from a small region of Germany (see doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0185809). This is a very famous study, but also one that has its flaws, such as being a space-for-time substitution (i.e., different sites sampled at different times used as a proxy for change through time). The declines are also primarily driven by a handful of sites first sampled in 1989 then again around I think 2015/2016/2017, and the declines are in total biomass of insects captured by Malaise traps. These are passive samplers that trap passing flying insects, which are primarily non-pollinating flies like midges. So this study acts as an important warning, but you have to be cautious when extrapolating such findings to all taxa across the globe.

A variety of follow up studies in different places have shown the picture is much more mixed, with losses in some regions/key taxa (e.g., certain pollinators or insects in urban areas), whereas other regions/taxa have experienced gains as certain ranges expand due to a variety of reasons, such as non-native introductions and climate change. A recent article provides a very nice, overall picture of this issue (doi.org/10.1016/j.cois.2025.101338).

Important insects, including pollinators, are in trouble and there are a variety of things everyone can do to help out (e.g., plant native species, mow less, use less pesticide, keep some litter and brush in your yard), but please be aware that there is no evidence that global insect populations have declined by 75% as the thread title implies.",2025-04-22 20:01:28,27,Snarfums,science

ml9x4jf,1jqt6q4,reddit,"Whooo.  Lots of comments in here confused about the Western Diet, and I guess that's to be expected as most people in science are not in nutrition science.

The Western Diet is a specific term in nutrition studies.  It does not specifically mean ""anywhere in the West"" but instead refers to a diet that is high in fat- and more specifically, saturated fats- high in sugar or simple carbohydrates, and low in fiber.  It actually does mimic the general eating patterns of a majority of Americans, if for no other reason than because fresh vegetables and produce are expensive and cooking at home is time consuming.  For many, many people who are working, raising children, and struggling to make ends meet, this is a huge barrier to access to ""healthy"" foods.

If you have never had to look at responses to food frequency questionnaires, I can see how this might seem wild and out there.  But it is not.  There are pockets in America where we see different eating patterns, but- unsurprisingly- those pockets also tend to be more affluent areas.

The Western Diet is used very commonly in nutrition studies, but that is because it is an accurate reflection of the population as a whole.

To my knowledge, there is no such similar standardized diet that falls under the umbrella term for African diet.

mlaw0d6,1jqt6q4,reddit,"Since so many people here are taking issue with the terms ""generalizing"" diets, ""Traditional African Diet"" and ""Western Diet"", I want to explain their use as someone studying immunology and have read a fair bit of papers on connections between diet and microbiota diversity/immunity/disease. 



Diet and medicine has been studied for a long time and it was decades ago that we first started using the term ""Western Diet"". At the time, this diet was pretty much only found in westernized societies and consisted of highly processed foods, fast food, and sugary drinks. People weren't as health conscious back then and it was really common. So we could say that it really did refer to the diet of westerners. 



As other countries also became more modernized and processed foods became more widespread, this diet began popping up in other places. So it no longer referred solely to the diet of westerners, rather the diet of a ""westernized"" society. Simultaneously, more work was done to characterize what makes this diet different from others and this term will always refer to a diet rich in refined carbs, fat, and low in fibre but scientists may also choose to add ""minor"" characteristics like high-calorie, low nutrition, etc. Most articles which use the term ""western diet"" will further define in the introduction somewhere how they are characterizing the western diet in their article. 



A lot of amazing work has been done looking at the impacts of this kind of diet and this term has been solidified, so it's going to continue to be used in science even though western societies are becoming more health conscious and potentially diversifying their diet (although this is actually difficult to achieve for many in certain western societies due to economic barriers). (A good review on western diet and inflammation: DOI: 10.1016/j.immuni.2019.09.020)



Basically, when scientists write or read the term ""western diet"" they're not going to think: ""hmm what's the western diet now?"". Recently, I have seen some articles trying to accommodate for changes by calling it ""western-type diet"", though not sure how much that helps. Here's a well-cited review on 



To add to comments which state the ""traditional African diet"" is vague, it's not in the full article behind the paywall. A quick point: It's well established that low fibre, high refined carbs/sugar diets are bad, but the point of this study was to gather data on underrepresented non-western diet (i.e., the traditional African diet), investigate what happens when you switch from a western diet to traditional African diet (and vice versa), and look at the effect of fermented drinks. 



Here's what the study does. First, the authors define the ""traditional African diet"" and the western diet in the introduction. ""Africa has a rich diversity of heritage diets, often rich in vegetables, fruits, legumes, grains and fermented products.  (importantly is the inclusion of fermented foods, hence one of the comparison groups wasn't a diet switch but just the addition of a traditional fermented drink). ""Western-style diets, high in calorie-dense and processed foods..."". 



Their definition is directly reflected in their sampling; subjects were only included if their typical diet matched the definition above: ""Most rural dwellers in the study were from the Chagga tribe, whose heritage diet is predominantly plant-based, rich in fiber and polyphenols, and includes ‘Mbege’, a fermented banana beverage made with finger millet. \[...\] Questionnaires were evaluated by a nutritionist to ensure participants were adhering to either a diet typical of the Kilimanjaro region or a Western-style diet.  \[...\] Only participants adhering to either a Kilimanjaro heritage-style diet or Western-style diet were further considered for participation."".",2025-04-04 01:24:50,3,corn_toes,science

From the linked article: 

Americans without diabetes spent nearly $6 billion USD on semaglutide and similar drugs in a year

The number of US adults who don't have diabetes who are taking semaglutide or a similar drug rose more than threefold from 2018-2022, according to Australian researchers. The team looked at data from a medical expenditure survey in the US to investigate the use of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists (GLP1-RAs) - a class of drugs including semaglutide and liraglutide that can treat both diabetes and obesity. The researchers say annual expenditure on GLP1-RAs from people in the US without diabetes hit $5.8 billion USD in 2022 with an estimate of 800,000 to a million people using the drugs who don't have diabetes.",2025-04-01 03:11:52,14,mvea,science
mkt92hz,1jolw6v,reddit,"I know several people who used it and were pleased with results. However, one of them went from toileting once a day regularly to only once a week sometimes less. This person also said they were having trouble feeling hungry enough to actually eat. That they essentially had to force themselves to eat. They also had to figure out proper caloric and protein intake when they eventually turned to smoothies and nutritional shake supplements in order to have enough nutritionally dense food intake. They have said they are now on a maintenance dose of the medication. Which makes me wonder if they are expected to be on the medication long term, if that is something it is meant for, and the long term ramifications of taking this medication for that length of time. 

Personally that is not something I want to experience. I need to lose weight but have a history of constipation as a baby/child/adolescent that I was able to get better from. When I say it was bad, it was really bad. The first time I experienced it I was literally months old.

Anybody who does the former is basically just *renting* their weight loss, because if they don’t simultaneously change their eating and exercise habits, it’ll all come back as soon as they stop the injections.

I’m a 70 year old Type 2 diabetic, and a few years ago, over a period of 7 months, weekly glucagon injections helped me drop from 205 lbs to 145, nearly *a third* of my body weight. I’m 5’8”, so the difference is very noticeable. 

Because I’m satiated much more readily I’m content with “normal” sized meals instead of my former “bachelor portions”. I don’t go back for seconds, I don’t binge or get cravings any more, and I no longer graze on leftovers or sweets while watching late-night tv. Heck I don’t even go to buffets anymore because with my limited appetite they no longer represent value for me.  And If want pie, I’ll buy a pie without guilt, because I know that half of it is going to get thrown out on Day Five, instead of of the whole thing being gone by midnight on Day One. 

But the most significant changes are that (a) the weight loss has allowed me to more than double up on my daily exercise routine without pain or exhaustion, and (b) I’ve managed to turn my former bad eating habits around so successfully that I’m now down to *a quarter* of my initial weekly dose -  and yet I’m *still* able to maintain my varsity wrestling weight of 50+ years ago!",2025-04-01 06:22:59,17,theartfulcodger,science

But only a 1/3 of the weight loss is maintained after discontinuation, for people accessing it, is it generally understood that it's only one part of the puzzle to tackling the issue. Surely it's not feasible for lower income individuals for life-time use. Does that make sense. I only read it being used as a mono therapy rather than an adjunct. For people accessing it do you feel adequately supported?

mlb07l2,1jpwun0,reddit,"From my understanding, some pastors accuse people of certain lifestyles for provoking God to anger and sending storms to correct us, pointing to the story of Sodom and Gomorrah to justify it.

In my studies, I found [Zechariah 14:16-19] where God commands Gentiles to keep the Feast of Booths in Heaven or else they would receive plagues and storms out of season. Considering that churches pray God's will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven, and none of them observe the Feast of Booths (by imitating the homeless to live in a tent for a week), they ought to point the finger at themselves for taking God's name in vain. They asked for it.

I also found it curious that in [Luke 10], the laborers of the harvest went to each city as barefoot homeless men, and the cities that mistreated them earned the judgment of Sodom. It had nothing to do with homosexuality, but rather inhospitality and denying housing (or as [Ezekiel 16:49] puts it: failing to strengthen the hand of the poor and needy).

In any case, prophecy pointed to a 4th angel that pours out a vial on the sun to scorch men with fire in order to cause them to repent of their evils (Revelation 16:8-9).

Climate science isn't really any one thing, it's an interdisciplinary problem that spans a gamut from basic physics (what is the fundamental relationship between C02 concentration and temperature?) all the way through economics (if hitting a certain carbon target would require a 2% GDP cut, how much would that be worth relative to the next best use of the money) and international relations (what's the most stringent measure we could take against China and India's industrialization that wouldn't backfire catastrophically?)  Certain of these questions are much easier to answer than others!  

I often get the sense that some people tend to borrow the level of certainty appropriate to toy physics models and apply it to economic and social policy, which seems mistaken to me.  But probably, whatever your views on the subject are you should be less confident that you understand exactly what's going to happen.

The reality is individuals are only going to affect climate change through government action. And religious people aren't voting (by design) for those who are trying to slow or stop climate change. They've been engineered to be single issue voters so that the only thing that matters is the religious nature of abortion.

When we see ISSUES on the ballot (and not a D vs R person) those issues are voted very liberally. Pro-weed, Kansas was even pro abortion. Why?

It more or less 'grounds' you in the reality of our world.

It baffles me that we demand pretty serious proven qualifications for many professions but there are no formal qualifications required for people who want to involve themselves with politics/government determining the lives and futures of many millions of people inhabiting a country.

A pilot affecting the lives of a few hundred people must prove their abilities and knowledge regularly and are tested for their physical AND mental health (the German pilot committing suicide by crash).

A presidential candidate striving to affect the lives of hundreds of millions of people should at least be tested by a team of psychologists and psychiatrists for their mental fitness to take on such a huge responsibility to protect the people against mentally ill people running and ruining their lives. And also for a realistic world view based on an adequate level of knowledge. You want these people to know things, not 'feel' them.

mnth39s,1k2bkzq,reddit,"What they did was use lasers to deliver light to specific cone cells. Basically, you have three types of cone cells which perceive light. The wave lengths these cones perceive overlap, but one of them can see further into blue than either of the others, another can see further into red than either of the others, but the one that sees mostly green has overlap with at least one of the other two in its entire spectrum.  
To put it more simply, blue enough light will only trigger the one type of cone cell, red enough light will only trigger one type, but green light will always trigger two types. The way to get around this is to use a laser to directly stimulate only those green cone cells, so even though another type of cone could also perceive that light, none of it is hitting them. Your brain then makes up 'a new colour' to show you this new signal with a higher percentage of green than your retina has ever sent it before.  
Theoretically you could use the same technique to show colours to people with common types of colorblindness, but as they said, this is 'transient', it only works while the procedure is being performed.",2025-04-18 20:24:40,2,keeperkairos,science

This is interesting. Sentencing is a strange thing but I'd need to see or at least for everyone to understand that judges only sentence when the trial is, a trial by Judge. 

There are three kinds of sentencing, trial by Judge, trial by jury, or plea out. So if it is a trial by jury, the sentencing is also done by jury as well. The jury is given a range that they can choose. The range is usually very large for most felony convictions, and it's done that way for the totality of the crime. 

So before anyone says ""har har republican judges,"" not so fast. We'd need to see the breakdown of the trial types as well. 

The largest sentence I've personally seen for a sex related crime was 18 years for rape. It was so brazenly done, caught by many security cameras in a downtown area. I've also seen 4 years for continuous sexual assault of a child.

Optimal sexual frequency may exist and help mitigate depression odds in young and middle-aged U.S. citizens: A cross-sectional study

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032725000552

Highlights

• The correlation between sexual frequency and depression was first quantified in a representative sample of U.S. citizens.

• Sexual frequency of 1-2 times per week may have an optimal effect in reducing depression odds.

• Sexual frequency of 1-2 times per week could serve as a benchmark for favorable sexual and mental health.

From the linked article: 

Scientists find evidence that an “optimal sexual frequency” exists and mitigates depression

New research published in the Journal of Affective Disorders suggests that people who engage in sexual activity at least once a week are less likely to experience symptoms of depression. Drawing from a large, nationally representative sample of U.S. adults, the study found that sexual frequency was negatively associated with depression, even after accounting for factors like age, physical health, and socioeconomic status. The findings also suggest that having sex one to two times per week may offer the greatest psychological benefits.

Using statistical models that adjusted for these potential confounders, the researchers found a clear association: people who reported having sex at least once per week had significantly lower odds of depression compared to those who had sex less than once per month. Specifically, weekly sexual activity was associated with a 24% reduction in the odds of depression. Those who reported sex more than once per month but less than weekly had about a 23% reduction in depression odds.

The researchers also used a flexible modeling technique called restricted cubic splines to examine whether the relationship between sexual frequency and depression was linear or nonlinear. The analysis revealed what they described as a “saturation effect”—the psychological benefits of sex appeared to peak at a frequency of 52 to 103 times per year, or about one to two times per week. Increasing sexual frequency beyond this range did not seem to offer additional protection against depression.",2025-04-23 10:04:12,16,mvea,science

This is one of those things that is so damn ingrained into our biology, that studying the “Why?” is completely useless if you still can’t get laid. 

We know that people want sex and we know it’s depressing to want it and not have it, and we know that it’s a biological need that cannot be psychologically changed/corrected once it’s present. Hormones and all of that.

If we can’t change it and we already know how it affects us… What was the point of this study?

There’s a point in studying anything else because we can actually change it or understand it better, which can lead to a change of how you feel about it. No amount of knowledge will change the fact that you want to get laid. Period. The final experience is all that matters, why or how doesn’t matter.

>Research studies have provided evidence that CT scans used in targeted screening on healthy people, such as for lung cancer, will save lives, and that the benefits outweigh the risks.

>However, the researchers argue that the risk of cancer outweighs any potential benefit from the whole-body scans **offered by private clinics to healthy people**.

I bolded some of text above for emphasis.  There are private companies that offer diagnostic services, like CT scans, to people who have no medical complaints at all.  They feel perfectly healthy, and they get CT scans, or other scans, because somebody has convinced them to get one just to see if they can find anything wrong.  

This is closely related to issues of over-diagnosis and overtreatment: nobody's body is exactly, perfectly average, and minor deviations from the norm do not necessarily require a battery of additional tests or treatments.",2025-04-14 20:45:58,2309,echawkes,science

There's a lot of justified conversation in this thread about the increasing frequency of imaging, the perceived over-reliance on it, the harms and costs that come from reaching for radiology as a first-line test.  These are all reasonable takes, and there's a reality that (at least in the US where I practice) it feels like clinical judgement often takes a back seat to ordering a CT.  

This comes at a significant radiation dose to patients and 5% of all cancer is a truly staggering number, if it's true.  That makes it one of the highest ""environmental"" malignancy risks out there.

However, this math is more complicated than you might think.  Because, obviously, imaging people can and frequently does catch things that would lead to bad outcomes down the line.  How many colostomies have we saved by finding early diverticulitis?  Cancer survival is one of the few (only?) things the US does well, and a large part of that is because of imaging.  Yes, our patient is going to be really unhappy if they get lymphoma from our CT scan.  Would they trade getting lymphoma 20 years later for shitting into a bag out of a hole in their stomach 20 years earlier?  Overimaging wastes resources and causes cancer.  Underimaging misses things that could be intervened upon early.  The calculus is really not straightforward.",2025-04-15 01:54:36,169,1burritoPOprn-hunger,science

mn46jwb,1jz83cj,reddit,"The overuse of CT scans could cause over 100,000 cases of cancer in the US – with almost 10,000 cases in children, researchers have warned.

According to a new modelling study, published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, the high number of CT (computed tomography) scans carried out in the United States in 2023 could cause 5 per cent of all cancers in the country, equal to the number of cancers caused by alcohol.

CT scans increase the risk of cancer due to the use of ionising radiation. The risk to individuals is low and benefits most often outweigh the risks, as long as the scan is clinically justified.

However, a team of researchers from The Institute of Cancer Research, London, Kaiser Permanente Washington, Seattle, and the University of California, San Francisco, are concerned about the increasing radiation doses used in CT scans and the rising rates of use in the US. Since 2009, the number of CT scans carried out in the US has risen by 30 per cent.

The research team calculated the number of cancers expected in future in the US population that will be linked to the 93 million CT scans carried out on 62 million people in 2023.

Using a publicly available risk model developed by Professor Amy Berrington, Leader of the Clinical Cancer Epidemiology Group at The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) on lifetime cancer risk after exposure to radiation, combined with US data on the number of CT scans and doses, the team estimated the numbers and types of cancers that were expected in both children and adults.

Lead, once common in paint and gasoline, is a neurotoxin that affects brain development, particularly in children. This meta-analysis suggests that early exposure doesn’t just impact cognitive ability but also alters fundamental aspects of personality, such as increased neuroticism and reduced conscientiousness. These traits can have lifelong consequences, influencing career success, relationships, and even mental health.

What makes this finding even more concerning is its societal impact. If lead exposure systematically affects personality traits, entire generations may have been subtly shaped by environmental pollution in ways we are only beginning to understand. This raises ethical questions about historical negligence and the responsibility of governments and industries to prevent similar exposures in the future.

mkp9f7o,1jnzwju,reddit,"Personally, I do know that my social media and phone usage overall isn't that great, however I also have the issue that I barely see anyone irl, even when I do try to make friends in very different communities irl, it's actually really, really hard to meet new friends, or to convince my existing friends to hang out at all.






I would actually much rather prefer to go skateboarding or even just volonteering to play with children in my free tin, but it's not currently available, at least for most of the time.






I currently feel like my study is useless and I don't even feel like I'm in a community there, so I feel much less motivated to do literally anything at all about it.








The issue is also that to continue conversations, especially with new people, I have to write them on Instagram or Facebook, we're really not used to just meeting people and then hanging out later together nowadays unfortunately, plus, when I go to these apps, I'm bombarded with notifications and reels which make me distracted more.








Also, one thing, I do have interesting opinions and positions on a lot of different topics about our world and politics and I would genuinely like to make a change to the world and to fix what I see as injustices. I want to make my voice heard and to actually make a big difference on the world. Even more so when I feel misunderstood and how my views are unpopular so I feel kinda a need to defend them.






The problem is that in real life, for the most part, I really don't see my voice being heard at all, there aren't a lot of debate clubs, neither groups who would welcome such ideas, I also feel alienated from existing activist groups and that my views don't align with any of them. I also see that the average person doesn't like or want to discuss these things, and it's not like there's active spaces specifically meant to do stuff like that.








As such, I go on places like Reddit or Instagram, where it absolutely is possible to share my unpopular opinions and thoughts and even build my own ideology and community based on that. It is actually a space where my opinions and words don't go to waste.








However, these same places are also the places which are very toxic, with a lot of negativity and hate, especially related to politics. A lot of people won't even listen and will automatically hate you, sometimes even insulting you based on your perceived nationality or something, and just end up very mean.








And even without hate, just the concept of notifications with people replying objectively criticising my ideas at any time of the day (instead of specifically dedicated times like irl) means that I feel obligated to check out and to reply to them too to defend my position and to not get hated and rationed.






If you want to, you can check out my post and comment history to see how healthy you think it is.








But again, while I think about disconnecting from social media, I also currently don't see any other place to share my thoughts in any meaningful way. And the issue is that a lot of therapists just tell me to disconnect and to never write anything again which I don't think is the solution. I also feel like obviously I should've developed some healthier habits on writing these political posts and comments, to ignore all the replies if I have other stuff to do, etc, but I currently don't know how to and the people that surround me don't seem to propose actually good advice.








Plus, in general, I just feel like I don't have anything better to do for the most part. When I do try to disconnect from all that, it doesn't lead to more happiness because I don't have anything to substitute it with. And when I try to find places to actually socialise, have fun, and help my friends, I don't find any.








I don't know what exactly to do with all that to be honest. ",2025-03-31 15:40:53,1,Maimonides_2024,science

Perfectly normal people, well-adjusted people, without mental issues, and who know not to take social media so seriously, can use it just fine like any other source of entertainment. For those that have healthy mindsets deleting social media won’t boost enjoyment because it never degraded enjoyment in the first place. 

The problem is that for all the people complaining about how evil social media is and how it’s ruining their lives (etc etc) likely have far bigger personal issues that taint their enjoyment of life no matter if they used social media or not. As a result, the negative effects of social media become so much more pronounced. On the flip side, for people with these issues, deleting social media isn’t going to make them go away… hence the lack of any changes in enjoyment. 

That’s why I hate this narrative everyone spits out on here that “oh it’s all social media’s fault.” No. It’s a mental health problem… you just don’t want to admit you have issues. And it’s always so ironic people talk about how evil social media is on Reddit of all sites, one of the most moodiest and toxic social media sites there is.

From the linked article: 

Being physically active, even just a couple of days a week, may be key to better health

A “weekend warrior” approach to physical activity — getting 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity over one to two days instead of throughout the week — improved health and lowered the risk of death, finds a new study in the Journal of the American Heart Association

Research Highlights:

New research suggests that participating in at least 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity in just two days had similar health benefits as distributing the activity throughout the week.

People who followed the “weekend warrior” approach, condensing physical activity into one or two days each week, had a significantly lower risk of death from all causes, cardiovascular disease and cancer, similar to those who engaged in activity throughout the week.

The study examined the physical activity of more than 93,000 participants in a large U.K. biomedical database who wore wrist accelerometers to track their physical activity.

The analysis also found:

For weekend warriors, the risk of death from all causes was 32% lower; the risk of death from cardiovascular disease was 31% lower; and the risk of death from cancer was 21% lower.

Among participants in the active regular group, the risk of death from all causes was 26% lower; the risk of death from cardiovascular disease was 24% lower; and the risk of death from cancer was 13% lower.

No significant differences in the risk of death surfaced between the weekend warrior vs. the active regular group.",2025-04-02 12:04:47,42,mvea,science

mlph14j,1jsvw4h,reddit,"From the article: Two experiments conducted on young people in the United Kingdom found that men are more distracted by sexual images than women. In all conditions, participants were slower to make decisions when exposed to sexual images. The research was [published](https://doi.org/10.3390/sexes5040050) in Sexes.

Stimuli that evoke emotions tend to capture attention and trigger quicker reactions. For instance, forming a first impression of someone might take several seconds, but determining whether a person poses a threat takes less than a second. People generally respond more rapidly to threatening images than to non-threatening ones.

Similarly, sexual images can also trigger emotional reactions and alter attention and response times in a way comparable to threatening stimuli. Some studies have identified what is called a “sexual content-induced delay.” For example, in one study, participants were asked to decide whether a string of letters formed a real word. Results showed they took more time to classify sexual words than non-sexual ones. This delay likely occurs because sexual images capture cognitive priority, distracting individuals from other tasks.

Study author Robert J. Snowden and his colleagues aimed to examine how the presence of sexual images affects performance in a simple perceptual task—specifically, comparing the orientation of two lines. They hypothesized that sexual images would produce a delay in processing the task. The researchers also wanted to explore whether the magnitude of this effect differed between men and women, and whether it changed depending on whether the sexual image matched the participant’s preferred gender. Two experiments were conducted.

Participants in the first experiment included 43 young adults recruited via advertisements around the School of Psychology at Cardiff University in the United Kingdom. The average age was 22, and 22 participants were women.

Participants completed a line orientation perceptual task while being shown various images (which they were instructed to ignore). Ten of the images depicted heterosexual couples engaged in sexual activity, ten showed nude or partially dressed women who were not sexually active, ten showed nude or partially dressed men who were also not sexually active or aroused, ten contained people in neutral settings (e.g., people working or shopping), and ten depicted objects (e.g., clocks, boats, gardens). All images were converted to grayscale. Each participant completed 150 trials, with each image appearing three times. Participants also reported their sexual orientation.",2025-04-06 14:53:16,373,chrisdh79,science

I want to know how long the men took to make a decision compared to women, not if there was a delay in the decision itself. If the decision by men is faster than women overall, any delay literally means men are processing additional information in a time less than woman make the initial decision to begin with, which is overall advantageous.

Edit: 

Poorly designed study. The study didn't include a condition with no distractions at all to establish a baseline reaction time for the task itself. We can see even in the neutral condition of zero sexual context, men are performing slower than women. Without a baseline measurement we can't observe if men have a slower reaction time in general or if slower reaction time is a product of additional information itself.

Tracking Tiny Facial Movements Can Reveal Subtle Emotions in Autistic Individuals

A Rutgers-led study examines how detecting microscopic facial movements, previously overlooked, are key to enhancing emotional recognition in autistic individuals

A study led by Rutgers University–New Brunswick researchers suggests that tiny facial movements – too slight for the human eye to notice – could help scientists better understand social communication in people with autism.

Published in Frontiers in Psychiatry, the study found that while individuals with autism express emotions like everyone else, their facial expressions may be too subtle for the human eye to detect.

“Autistic individuals use the same basic facial movements to express emotions, but their intensity often falls outside the culturally familiar range that most people recognize,” said Elizabeth Torres, a psychology professor at the Rutgers–New Brunswick School of Arts and Sciences. “This disconnect can lead to missed social cues, causing others to overlook or misinterpret their emotions.”",2025-04-11 02:24:52,254,mvea,science

And there’s something about being autistic where we are expressing ourselves but people have a habit of just not really sensing the urgency unless we are seriously overdramatising. Very often spoken over, ignored, or you say something like “I don’t like being touched” and the natural response is to want to provoke that person by touching them, then getting angry at them when they do lash out. I don’t think it was an undetectable emotion. I think it’s more that they could get away with saying that they didn’t know, like there’s some benefit of the doubt. Kinda like in sexual situations when someone clearly isn’t enjoying themselves but they didn’t say anything so they say “how was I supposed to know”? You know?

It feels like with most boundaries an autistic person won’t get listened to upon their first or second “come on guys don’t do that” and waits for you to get to your “please, please don’t do this, please”. Is that slightly more wooden when autistic? Probably, but it involves ignoring the words you’re saying. 

Either way, it tends to involve a lot of us struggling to emotionally regulate through words and expressions even more. And having more physical outbursts. Like you actually don’t have to be prone to meltdowns at all to start thinking that you have an anger issue because repeatedly do not listen to your voice nor read your body language until you punch them and you’re the one who has to apologise. 

Yet as an adult who picks the people I spend time around, most of whom are somewhat neurospicy, the others who are more politically or artistically inclined or nerdy etc nobody has ever put me in that position. When I was young there were definitely choices which were not the fault of other people but myself. Lack of overall control in life can do that. But a lot of my early 20s it was colleagues and such who simply choose not to pay attention because they can get away with acting innocent about it.

I’m not here to pretend that there aren’t individuals who emote less or use less emotion in their voice coz I know that there are.

MCL‑1 safeguards activated hair follicle stem cells to enable adult hair regeneration

Abstract

Hair follicles cycle through expansion, regression and quiescence. To investigate the role of MCL‑1, a BCL‑2 family protein with anti‑apoptotic and apoptosis‑unrelated functions, we delete Mcl‑1 within the skin epithelium using constitutive and inducible systems. Constitutive Mcl‑1 deletion does not impair hair follicle organogenesis but leads to gradual hair loss and elimination of hair follicle stem cells. Acute Mcl‑1 deletion rapidly depletes activated hair follicle stem cells and completely blocks depilation‑induced hair regeneration in adult mice, while quiescent hair follicle stem cells remain unaffected. Single‑cell RNA‑seq profiling reveals the engagement of P53 and DNA mismatch repair signaling in hair follicle stem cells upon depilation‑induced activation. Trp53 deletion rescues hair regeneration defects caused by acute Mcl‑1 deletion, highlighting a critical interplay between P53 and MCL‑1 in balancing proliferation and death. The ERBB pathway plays a central role in sustaining the survival of adult activated hair follicle stem cells by promoting MCL‑1 protein expression. Remarkably, the loss of a single Bak allele, a pro‑apoptotic Bcl‑2 effector gene, rescues Mcl‑1 deletion‑induced defects in both hair follicles and mammary glands. These findings demonstrate the pivotal role of MCL‑1 in inhibiting proliferation stress‑induced apoptosis when quiescent stem cells activate to fuel tissue regeneration.

From the linked article: 

Stopping hair loss may be as easy as boosting this “bodyguard” protein

We’re one step closer to not just treating baldness but preventing it, with scientists making an important discovery that offers keen insight into why hair growth comes to a screeching halt, offering new hope to millions of people across the globe.

In a new study led by Australia’s Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Reesearch (WEHI) and Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore, researchers have found that all-important hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs), which are in charge of hair growth, can’t do their job without a certain “bodyguard” protein. This protein, MCL-1, is a powerful agent in regulating cell death – and if levels are lowered, by way of outside forces such as stress, aging, cancer drugs or genetics, HSFCs are left vulnerable and overworked as they try to produce new growth. This ultimately causes them to die off, too.

Essentially, without adequate MCL-1 to safeguard the hardworking HFSCs, the stem cells become stressed to the point of self-destruction. Then, no hair will be produced. The researchers demonstrated this malfunction by switching off MCL-1 in mice and removing patches of existing hair. The team observed that the HFSCs were still alive for some time, but soon became overworked – which triggered a stress signal (P53) that ultimately killed the cells.

Until now, scientists didn’t know that HFSCs, found deep beneath the surface of our skin, were so fragile and vulnerable to outside forces without the protection of the MCL-1 protein. And by blocking P53 or boosting MCL-1 levels, we might be able to safeguard these vital cells and in turn prevent hair loss.

And while programmed cell death (apoptosis) is a critical mechanism for deleting faulty and old cells in order for the body to regenerate new, more productive cells, HFSCs even at their most active will ultimately work themselves to death without adequate MCL-1 protection. The scientists observed this happening in just a few days in their mice model. This now opens new avenues of research to develop novel treatment for conditions like alopecia as well as broader hair-loss prevention.",2025-03-27 17:30:08,48,mvea,science

I've been in therapy for most of my life because I always felt there was something ""wrong"".  I've always felt disconnected or left out.  Everyone else gets the jokes, but they make no sense to me.  That sort of thing.  I've had multiple professionals tell me I should get tested for ASD.  Every time I've looked into it, it never happens.  ""I'd like to focus on your depression."" is a favorite among therapists.  

I was given a full psych profile test while going through vocational rehabilitation.  I have trouble keeping jobs, so I figured they could help me with accommodations.  They never told me the results of the psych profile.  They just said that I was eligible to work.  Fast forward 7 years and I'm asking my current therapist what it takes to get an ASD diagnosis since I've been told to look into it.  She tells me ""You already have one.""  She had obtained my records from voc rehab.

Turns out, the psych profile they did had me diagnosed as ""Autism Spectrum, severe"" (which honestly kind of sounds harsh for some reason).  In times of high stress, I exhibit many signs of autism (such as being nonverbal, rocking back and forth, the works).  I just rarely allow myself to experience that level of stress (if I can help it).  I tend to remove myself from stressful situations, which I'm sure is some other diagnosable trait, but that's beside the point.

Anyway, working with my therapist, I was able to recognize many traits of mine that prove the diagnosis.  Just wish I knew what to do with any of it.  Congratulations.  I'm diagnosed... Now what?  My mother still refuses to acknowledge it.  I still can't hold a job.

mkin2ua,1jnaxp9,reddit,"On That “Self-Report ≠ Autism” Study and Why It’s NOT Your Gatekeeping License

So I see people running around with the new Nature Mental Health study like it’s a weapon to bash self-diagnosed autistics.

Let’s break this down.

1. This study does not disprove self-diagnosis.
It says self-report measures and clinician assessments capture different things.
Not fake vs. real.
Not valid vs. invalid.
Different domains. Internal experiences vs. external behaviors.

2. It doesn’t say people with high autistic traits are lying.
It says many of them, especially in online spaces also experience social anxiety and avoidant personality traits.
Gee, I wonder why.
Could it be... trauma?
Masking?
Being forced to survive in a world that punishes neurodivergence?

3. It doesn’t discredit late-diagnosed, AFAB, queer, or BIPOC autistics.
Clinical diagnosis is NOT accessible to everyone. The system is biased, hostile, and broken.
Self-diagnosis isn’t a trend; it’s often the only path to understanding for people locked out of healthcare.

4. The study itself warns against what some of you are doing.

“We do not believe these results suggest self-report questionnaires are invalid.”
It literally says self-report is vital for capturing subjective experience. You know, things clinicians often overlook.

5. If you’re using this study to erase self-diagnosed autistics, you’re reinforcing ableist systems.
What you’re saying is:
“Only those approved by the system deserve support.”
But the system is built to exclude. Especially the poor, the racialized, the traumatized, the gender-nonconforming.

6. Newsflash: Your “gold standard” diagnosis misses people. A lot of people.
Because it was designed that way.
It’s time we stopped confusing medical access with medical truth.

7. So what should this study do?

Help researchers refine tools.

Encourage both self-report and clinical data in studies.

Highlight the difference between internal struggle vs. visible behavior.

Not become a bludgeon against self-diagnosed neurodivergent people.

8. We are real. Our pain is real. Our adaptations are real.
Some of us are autistic.
Some of us are traumatized.
Some of us are both.
All of us deserve respect, support, and understanding.

If you care more about purity policing than people’s lives, you’re not helping the community.
You’re reinforcing the institutions that broke us.

Self-diagnosed doesn’t mean self-invented.
It means self-aware in the face of exclusion. And that? That’s survival. That’s resilience. That’s valid.

Edit: To everyone who thanked me, you are all so welcome. I am one of you. I experienced it all. Now, I fight for awareness on a macro level and, hopefully, one day, on a mezzo level.",2025-03-30 13:50:46,182,KnightRiderCS949,science
mki81s8,1jnaxp9,reddit,"I’ve linked to the news release in the post above. In this comment, for those interested, here’s the link to the peer reviewed journal article: 

https://www.nature.com/articles/s44220-025-00385-8

Abstract

While allowing for rapid recruitment of large samples, online research relies heavily on participants’ self-reports of neuropsychiatric traits, foregoing the clinical characterizations available in laboratory settings. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) research is one example for which the clinical validity of such an approach remains elusive. Here we compared 56 adults with ASD recruited in person and evaluated by clinicians to matched samples of adults recruited through an online platform (Prolific; 56 with high autistic traits and 56 with low autistic traits) and evaluated via self-reported surveys. Despite having comparable self-reported autistic traits, the online high-trait group reported significantly more social anxiety and avoidant symptoms than in-person ASD participants. Within the in-person sample, there was no relationship between self-rated and clinician-rated autistic traits, suggesting they may capture different aspects of ASD. The groups also differed in their social tendencies during two decision-making tasks; the in-person ASD group was less perceptive of opportunities for social influence and acted less affiliative toward virtual characters. These findings highlight the need for a differentiation between clinically ascertained and trait-defined samples in autism research.

From the linked article: 

New study finds online self-reports may not accurately reflect clinical autism diagnoses

A new study published in Nature Mental Health suggests that adults who report high levels of autistic traits through online surveys may not reflect the same social behaviors or clinical profiles as those who have been formally diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. Although these two groups may appear similar on paper, the study found meaningful differences in their social interactions, mental health symptoms, and the way they perceive and influence others during social tasks. The findings raise questions about the widespread reliance on self-report surveys in online autism research and suggest that diagnostic evaluations by trained professionals remain essential.

The results showed that although the high-trait online group and the in-person autism group reported similar levels of autistic traits, their profiles differed in key ways. The online group with high autistic traits reported more symptoms of social anxiety and avoidant personality disorder than the clinically diagnosed group. In fact, their psychiatric profiles resembled those of people who are socially anxious but not necessarily autistic. This suggests that some people who score high on autism trait questionnaires in the general population may actually be describing a different type of social struggle—one rooted more in anxiety than in autism.

One of the most striking findings came from the comparison between self-report and clinical assessment. Among participants with a confirmed autism diagnosis, there was no meaningful relationship between how they rated their own symptoms and how clinicians rated them. This held true for both core domains of autism: repetitive behaviors and social communication.

But in my opinion self-diagnosis creates a very sharp tension in advocacy for this movement. As far as I can determine Autism groups appear very open and accepting of self-diagnosis which from the perspective of building community and peer support absolutely makes sense - I don't think there is any harm.

Where I'm not so sure about is wider advocacy, critique of research and intervention. I don't want to baselessly make this statement, but based on this article and others, I have a sense that there are very vocal advocacy groups online that may be composed of or at least have significant populations of non-diagnosed advocates. Depending on the aims/goals this can vary in importance, e.g. if the matters are controversial topics that affect the entire spectrum of the Autistic population, it seems concerning if the main voices being heard are from self-diagnosed individuals.",2025-03-30 21:13:48,4,ThomasEdmund84,science

mkjk50l,1jnaxp9,reddit,"Up until 2013 you literally could not get clinically diagnosed with both ADHD and Autism. And since then a lot of ADHDers and a lot of Autistic people have learned they have both because they saw content on people that have both, began to wonder about it, researched the hell out of it, saw multiple therapists over it, and then if they were super lucky got a referral to a psychologist who actually knows the updated information. Usually, however, they just get diagnosed with ADHD with OCD,  Social Anxiety, Bipolar, Cyclothymia or Borderline Personality Disorder.

Also,  Autism and ADHD literally have symptoms that mask each other. Prior to 2013, many of these individuals were unlikely to get diagnosed with either and to get the accurate diagnosis of both was impossible.

For the first time in the 12 years since we could diagnose both ADHD and Autism we are getting a book, Explaining AuDHD by Dr Khurram Sadiq, on that specific combination by a psychiatrist who not only specializes in both ADHD and Autism for 20+ years but is also both himself.

Both ADHD and Autism are in horrible need of updating to reflect how their symptoms change as people progress from childhood to adulthood with ADHD and/or Autism. Because up until recently, a lot of professionals mistakenly assumed people simply grew out of ADHD (in particular) and Autism as well due to people masking those symptoms or the symptoms turning from external presentations to internal ones.

Abstract

The present research examines the factors that contribute to a negative bias in how Americans imagine the future of their country. Specifically, we tested the effects of perceived country well-being, national identity (Study 1), and news coverage (Study 2) on Americans’ collective future thinking. Study 1 was situated in a cross-cultural context, in which US and Chinese participants listed within 1 min as many exciting or worrying events as they could that might happen in their country’s future and reported perceived country well-being and national identity. In Study 2, US participants read positive, negative, or neutral news events happening in their country and then imagined what might happen in their country’s near and distant futures. Americans imagined more negative relative to positive events and rated positive events less positively and negative events more negatively than did Chinese, with the cultural differences explained by the lower perceived country well-being among Americans. US participants exposed to negative news showed greater negative bias in their collective future thoughts than those exposed to neutral or positive news, and the effect was explained by the lower perceived country well-being in the negative news condition. These findings underscore the complexity of collective future perceptions and the significance of psychological and societal factors in shaping how people foresee their country’s future.

Bad News Bias Perpetuates Collective Pessimism

Negative news chips away at people’s hope for their country’s future.

KEY POINTS

Americans have a dim view of their country’s future.

The US media is biased towards bad news.

People are pessimistic about the nation’s future after reading bad news.

Americans are losing hope for their country’s future: They see a decline from the country’s past to its present to its future, in important areas such as the economy, political polarization, income disparity, and the country’s role on the global stage. While many factors may have contributed to this dim view, new coverage in the US plays an important role.",2025-04-05 10:07:53,1,mvea,science

During childhood I never understood why adults would even want to watch about murders, car crashes, or robberies, and never understood why the media won't focus on nicer things like people's recovery from assault, new public transport, or new non-profit projects for socially vulnerable groups.

mljh2r5,1js05dt,reddit,"The long-held belief in 20th century news is “if it bleeds it leads,” but is someone being shot, or a fire, or even a car crash “NEWS?” 

No. It’s not. It’s important statistically, as a group, to know. Or if it’s a rash of shootings or crashes that have the same pattern — that’s news. But you’ll see every shooting and fire and crash on the news every day. Even though they’re not actually news at all. 

I call this the “crane in midtown” effect. If a crane falls in midtown Manhattan the nightly news covers it because they are all headquartered nearby and can get disaster footage. But, a crane falling in midtown is local news to new york — it is not anywhere close to being national news. 

We need a shift in journalism’s focus. 

We need local journalists to cover local corruption, construction projects, growth of the community, and advances made in public and private services. We need news that keeps us informed about the state of things (not just our town, or our own little country but the world too). News should give context to stories that we already heard about on social media. Tell stories of the people who live near and far and build their communities up.

This is going to be basically impossible of course. Because though Journalists care about this, the Media is a for-profit enterprise competing for ad-dollars and eyeballs.

mlu14wj,1jtglex,reddit,"Scientists at La Trobe University have discovered how a diarrhoea-causing strain of bacteria uses “molecular scissors” to cut open and destroy gut cells, leading to severe illness and sometimes death.

Published in Gut Microbes, the research reveals for the first time the three-dimensional structure of a toxin secreted by enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) bacteria, and shows how the bacteria use the toxin to invade and destroy the epithelial cells that line the gut.

The toxin, which is an enzyme called EspC, destroys the cells by cutting up their internal protein structure.

La Trobe University scientist Professor Begoña Heras, who co-led the research, said understanding how the dangerous bacterial toxin worked was critical for the future development of new, targeted drugs to treat EPEC infections in the face of rising antimicrobial resistance.

“Many strains of E. coli, including EPEC which is a major cause of diarrheal disease, are becoming increasingly resistant to the antibiotics commonly used to treat these infections,” Professor Heras said.

mognlsk,1k5bp9d,reddit,"Teenagers who go to bed earlier and sleep for longer than their peers tend to have sharper mental skills and score better on cognitive tests, researchers have said.

A study of more than 3,000 adolescents showed that those who turned in earliest, slept the longest, and had the lowest sleeping heart rates outperformed others on reading, vocabulary, problem solving and other mental tests.

  
The researchers expected teenagers with healthy sleeping habits to score better than those who slept poorly, but were surprised at the impact that even small differences in sleep made.

“We think that it’s the sleep driving the better cognitive abilities, in part because we consolidate our memories during sleep,” said Barbara Sahakian, a professor of clinical neuropsychology at the University of Cambridge.

A good night’s rest has long been linked to better mental performance, but researchers are still teasing apart what happens in adolescence when crucial brain development coincides with a shift towards later bedtimes and less sleep overall.

Lower socioeconomic status adolescents could be getting less sleep and have less time for studying due to increased working hours, childcare demands, and higher overall stress levels. This would also reduce the amount of time that they have for studying and participating in extracurricular enrichment (art, sports, etc.) which we know are beneficial to our brain development.

People can drink in secret, people can keep their drinking from their families, or have a beer at lunch at the office and family might never know, and then there's the measurement issues, memory issues, cultural issues, etc. Impossible to know if this is accurate. 

- the article explicitly says this is an association, not causation. Then quotes the main scientist as saying the study proves that alcohol causes brain damage. 

- they mention correcting for some factors, but seemingly ignore genetics, neurocognitive disorders that predispose you to alcohol abuse and obviously effect cognitive function, trauma... Too many confounding variables.

If you’re a 6’5 225lb guy in perfect shape vs a relatively unfit 105lb woman, a couple drinks a day is a pretty dramatic difference to you. One is much bigger risk than others. 

Good to understand that alcohol isn’t healthy for you, but on the spectrum of harms it’s not the most dangerous thing. I like to think about it like systemic load on your body - if you’re chainsmoking and can’t walk 30’ without being out of breath, alcohol is just going to be one more burden on your system that makes things worse. 

Flip side of that, plenty of people live very healthy lives (a lot of Europeans) who eat great diets, exercise and walk a ton daily, don’t smoke, etc often have far fewer health issues despite drinking alcohol sometimes to what would be considered “heavy” by this study. 

So if you’re a normal person, I’d be thinking more about your personal risk factors, fitness level, tobacco use, how much extra weight you’re carrying around, etc. than just having an extra beer with your buddies. There are plenty of people in your lives who probably aren’t making great decisions with their drinking and if you can lower your systemic risks with solid diet, exercise, awareness of your health history and predispositions, and make otherwise good choices - go ahead an enjoy that nice cold beverage.

> **Former heavy drinking was associated with a lower brain mass ratio, a smaller proportion of brain mass compared to body mass, and worse cognitive abilities**. No link was found between moderate or heavy drinking and brain mass ratio or cognitive abilities.

> Justo noted that, in addition to brain injuries, impaired cognitive abilities were observed only in former drinkers.  

>**Researchers also found that heavy drinkers died an average of 13 years earlier than those who never drank.**

But when a user goes too far and winds up in the hospital, the negative consequences can reach far into the future, says a [new study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2832249).

While the Grateful Dead once sang ""too much of everything is just enough,"" that certainly doesn't seem to be the case with a substance well-known to many a Deadhead: cannabis. Though the psychoactive plant has been linked to plenty of health benefits including better sleep, putting the brakes on melanoma growth, and improving a range of quality-of-life factors, excessive use of the drug has been shown to spike coronary artery disease risk and impair brain function in young users.

Now a team of Canadian researchers has added another warning to partaking too vigorously in cannabis: dementia.

In reaching their conclusions, scientists from institutes across Canada looked at a database consisting of six million adults aged 45 or older, none of whom had a history of dementia. They then found 16,275 individuals who had gone to the hospital from cannabis overuse.

Of that subgroup, 5% were diagnosed with dementia within five years, while 19% were diagnosed with the condition within 10 years. That represented a 23% greater risk in a dementia diagnosis over those who had received acute care for any other condition, and a whopping 72% higher risk than those in the general population.",2025-04-15 15:07:56,5,chrisdh79,science

mnba0ci,1jzu8ba,reddit,"Just because some of us are skeptical of this type of research, does not mean we don't believe in general that too much of most things are bad for you. 

But here are some valid concerns:

- This type of research tends to completely ignore method of consumption. It's been well established that smoke in your lungs will do bad things to your health. But that's not the same thing as cannabis being bad. And consumption by smoking is on the decline as far as I can tell.
- The large mass of research on the topic is based on self-reported use. Getting consistent answers to how these questions are actually worded to patients is not believable in most of these studies. ""Would you consider your use heavy?"" has completely different meanings to different people.
- As long as I've been alive there has been skewed and outright misleading research on this topic, including from doctors and universities. That has to be front-and-center, and the authors need to address the serious limitations their research has.

Until a proper study distinguishes these things and doesn't rely on self-answers by patients, just to show a few percentage points difference in a specific ailment... I mean how does one objectively expect people to respond to this?

Does cannabis hamper memory related tasks in both short and long term? Probably. Does it cause some slight increase in some brain related diseases? Probably. Does virtually everything we consume these days do the same? Pretty much.

Is sufficient evidence provided for people to change their habits here? Not really. Not to me.

And because I'm about to get accused of being an addict, and disbeliever in science, the last time I used was about 75 days ago - on recommendation of my doctor I have stopped.

Results

Among 73,838 adults (mean [±SD] age, 65±9.8 years), a total of 13,802 (18.7%) died during a median follow-up of 10 years. Across all participants, greater wealth was associated with lower mortality, with adjusted hazard ratios for death (quartile 2, 3, or 4 vs. quartile 1) of 0.80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76 to 0.83), 0.68 (95% CI, 0.65 to 0.71), and 0.60 (95% CI, 0.57 to 0.63), respectively. The gap in survival between the top and bottom wealth quartiles was wider in the United States than in Europe. Survival among the participants in the top wealth quartiles in northern and western Europe and southern Europe appeared to be higher than that among the wealthiest Americans. Survival in the wealthiest U.S. quartile appeared to be similar to that in the poorest quartile in northern and western Europe.

Conclusions

In cohort studies conducted in the United States and Europe, greater wealth was associated with lower mortality, and the association between wealth and mortality appeared to be more pronounced in the United States than in Europe.

From the linked article: 

Even the richest Americans face shorter lifespans than their European counterparts, study finds

A study by researchers at the Brown University School of Public Health found that Americans have poorer survival rates than Europeans across all wealth levels and detailed factors driving the disparity.

Comparing wealth and survival rates in the U.S. with those in Europe, researchers found that over a 10-year period, Americans across all wealth levels were more likely to die than their European counterparts.

The findings were detailed in a new study in the New England Journal of Medicine by a team led by researchers at the Brown University School of Public Health. 

The analysis compared data from more than 73,000 adults in the U.S. and different regions of Europe who were age 50 to 85 in 2010 to determine how wealth affects a person’s chances of dying. The results revealed that people with more wealth tend to live longer than those with less wealth, especially in the U.S., where the gap between the rich and poor is much larger than in Europe.

Comparison data also showed that at every wealth level in the U.S., mortality rates were higher than those in the parts of Europe the researchers studied. The nation’s wealthiest Americans have shorter lifespans on average than the wealthiest Europeans; in some cases, the wealthiest Americans have survival rates on par with the poorest Europeans in western parts of Europe such as Germany, France and the Netherlands.",2025-04-02 22:27:35,41,mvea,science

Highlights

• Saccadic reaction time measured women’s sensitivity to subliminal sad baby faces.

• Longer latencies followed subliminal sad baby faces (vs happy baby and sad adult).

• Sad infant expressions bias attention below the threshold of consciousness.

• Subliminal paradigms can reveal adult sensitivity to infant emotional cues.

Women unconsciously tune into infant distress, regardless of parental status, study finds

A new study published in Biological Psychology has found that women—whether they are mothers or not—are more likely to have their attention captured by distressed infant faces, even when those faces are presented so briefly that they are not consciously perceived. Using eye-tracking technology and subliminal exposure to emotional facial expressions, the researchers discovered that sad baby faces triggered longer reaction times than both happy baby faces and sad adult faces. These results suggest that the human brain may automatically prioritize signs of infant distress, highlighting an unconscious attentional bias that could support caregiving behavior.

The findings revealed a significant interaction between face age and emotion. Specifically, participants took longer to disengage their attention after viewing a subliminal sad baby face compared to both happy baby faces and sad adult faces. This pattern was observed across all participants, with no statistically significant differences between mothers and non-mothers. On average, the delay in disengagement was about 16 to 18 milliseconds when participants were exposed to a subliminal sad infant face.

These results suggest that distressed baby faces automatically draw more of women’s attention, even when they are not consciously seen. The prolonged saccadic latencies imply that the brain allocates more cognitive resources to processing sad baby faces compared to other emotional expressions. This unconscious attentional bias appears to be specific to the combination of infant features and negative emotional expression, rather than simply the presence of sadness or the baby face alone.",2025-04-12 12:06:50,5,mvea,science

Abstract

About 2 million people in the United States do not have access to running water or indoor plumbing in their homes. In addition, 30 million more Americans live where water systems operate unsafely. More still could have access to clean and safe drinking water but cannot afford to pay for it. Water privatization has been proposed as both a solution to and an exacerbator of these challenges, but its potential consequences have not been investigated on a national scale. Data from the US Environmental Protection Agency’s Safe Drinking Water Information System and the US Center for Disease Control’s Environmental Justice Index were used to assess the spatial distribution of water injustice hotspots, water system violations, and water system ownership. These data were merged with a nationally representative survey of US residents that measured how people perceive their water across different water injustice indicators. Results indicated that water system violations were not randomly distributed across the United States and risks of exposure to water injustice appeared to cluster in certain locations as hotspots. Clusters of water system violations were spatially associated with private water system ownership. Hotspots of water injustice were more often surrounded by counties with low proportions of privately owned water systems than counties with high proportions. Results also suggested that individuals living in areas with higher water injustice perceived their water as lower quality and less reliable. Water system ownership moderated this relationship. Recommendations for policymakers are discussed, including how to build collaborative decision-making processes that account for both objective and subjective measures of water injustice.

Researchers identify US counties with worst drinking water violations

The U.S. counties with the most egregious water quality violations are concentrated in four states: West Virginia, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Oklahoma, a new study has found.

Standing out among the top-10 such regions was Wyoming County, W. Va., whose public water utility boasted the highest number of infringements in a single water system, according to the study, published Tuesday in international journal Risk Analysis.

About 2 million people nationwide — equivalent to Nebraska’s entire population — do not have running water, and this lack of basic drinking water services tends to occur in clusters, the study authors determined.

“This high number is neither equally nor proportionally distributed across the population,” they wrote.

With another 30 million people reliant on drinking water systems that violate safety rules, the researchers sought to determine what types of systems are most prone to these deficiencies.",2025-04-15 14:07:50,43,mvea,science

Lower levels of immunity have resulted in a resurgence of measles cases, including a recent outbreak in western Texas that infected more than 620 people, leading to 64 hospitalizations and the deaths of two children.

If immunization rates drop further over a prolonged period of time, measles and even other wiped-out diseases — such as rubella and polio — could one day make a comeback in the United States, according to a new study by researchers at Stanford Medicine and other universities.

The study, which was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on April 24, used large-scale epidemiological modeling to simulate the spread of infectious diseases in the United States at various childhood vaccination levels.

I grew up before we had vaccines for measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox and polio. Thanks to measles I ran a fever of 105 degrees F for 3 days. My Mom had to spend those 3 days placing me in  and out of cold baths trying to break the fever. When I finally was able to return to school I could not read anything on the board or in the books. My eyes had basically been cooked and the shape of the eyeball was changed.

That might not be as harmful if they were crafting informed opinions using real research, but they aren't.  They are just absorbing the opinions they are exposed to most frequently as if they are their own.  Increasingly, their main exposure to opinions is an algorithmically-driven social media platform, which means misinformation now runs rampant, embeds itself in these people, and then persists as not only a sticky idea but an incredibly powerful one.  In this specific case, it was also strengthened by the overlap between anti-vaccine sentiments and political ideology post-COVID so that we now have borderline religious fervor from the anti-vaccine crowd.

movtkwg,1k70nlb,reddit,"Awesome, Can’t wait. I have a hypothesis that the last 30-50yrs with no major loss of life/ quality of life has lead to people genuinely thinking that these once horrible diseases are no big deal. That we are likely to head into a full on catastrophe in this span. People have become soft to the real terror of death and sickness, it used to be prevalent in society because we couldn’t treat a lot of ailments 100yrs ago, it was just a death sentence. People take the fruits of all our progress with a grain of salt. They can’t trust science which has given them quite possibly everything they could ever dream of but trust some idiot online or in office with major decisions. People in this country absolutely live like they have socialized medicine and no real consequences. 

This train of thought that exists here that “you need to do your research” or “ you should of known that X is bad for you” is absolutely stupid and is the mechanism that businesses use to put the burden on the individual and not them. I am by no means advocating for forced measures either. I feel that freedom of speech/ideas is an absolute necessity for science and the world. There needs to be liability attached to that however in some way. We cannot be tolerant of science denial just like many other forms of thought that are not healthy for society and the individual. The tolerance of intolerance only leads to a more intolerance stance as a whole. 

Covid genuinely was the breaking point for healthcare and any possible redemption this country could have toward understanding that vaccines are good.

mmxm3ae,1jydyxu,reddit,">In a new study, Sucharit Katyal and colleagues from University College London have identified the psychological mechanisms underlying persistent underconfidence.
>
>‘We recruited a large number of volunteers via a web-based platform and measured their symptoms of anxiety and depression. We then asked participants to complete a computer game where they had to help the residents of ‘Fruitville’ in harvesting fruit,’ explains Sucharit Katyal.
>
>The participants had to use both their visual and memory skills to complete the tasks. After each individual task, they had to report how confident they felt in their answer. Finally, they had to rate how well they felt they had completed the entire game.
>
>‘Here we discovered that participants with symptoms of anxiety and depression often ignored the times when they felt a high sense of confidence in their answers. Instead, they focused on situations where their answers were accompanied by low confidence when judging their overall performance,’ says Sucharit Katyal.

>In other words, the study shows that people with anxiety and depression may satisfactorily perform tasks - but ultimately are not updating their self-perception correctly.
>
>‘This points to the need for interventions that specifically address metacognitive distortions in people with anxiety and depression,’ says Sucharit Katyal.
>
>Interestingly, the study also shows that people with persistent insecurity in their abilities can correctly update their self-perception when they are explicitly told that they have performed well – rather than them having to rely on their own confidence assessments in those abilities.

OCD treatment especially outlines the issue with seeking external validation because it can become a compulsion in which you never truly believe that you're good enough without others telling you so. OCD is obviously different than GAD or MDD, but both have issues with internal-validation and usually require therapy to improve their self-talk.

Abstract

This study examines the relationship between respondents’ vaccine hesitancy, reported media consumption patterns, ideological leanings, and trust in science. A large-scale survey conducted in the US in 2022 (N = 1,646) assessed self-reported COVID-19 vaccination, trust in science, and reported media consumption. Findings show that, regardless of personal ideology, individuals who consumed less conservative media and had a more ideologically diverse media diet were more likely to be fully vaccinated and boosted. Additionally, consuming more conservative media was negatively associated with trust in science, but this relationship was weaker among those with a more ideologically diverse media diet. By incorporating data from an earlier wave of the survey in the summer of 2020, before COVID-19 vaccines were available, we found that a less conservative and more ideologically diverse media diet in 2022 predicted vaccination behavior in 2022, controlling for prior vaccine intentions and media consumption in 2020. A similar survey conducted in the UK in the summer of 2020 paralleled patterns in the US regarding vaccine intentions and media consumption. These results suggest that an ideologically diverse media diet is associated with reduced vaccine hesitancy. Public health initiatives might benefit from encouraging ideologically diverse media consumption.

From the linked article: 

A new study published in Scientific Reports suggests that people who consume a more ideologically diverse mix of news sources are more likely to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and to trust science—regardless of their personal political beliefs. At the same time, consuming more conservative media was associated with lower vaccine uptake and less trust in science. Importantly, the negative influence of conservative media appeared to be weaker among individuals with a more ideologically varied media diet.

The findings revealed a consistent pattern. People who consumed more conservative media were less likely to be fully vaccinated and boosted. This relationship held even after accounting for age, education, ethnicity, cognitive reflection, and personal ideology. In contrast, individuals who reported consuming a broader mix of ideologically different news outlets were more likely to have received the vaccine and a booster shot.

Moreover, consuming a diverse media diet appeared to weaken the negative link between conservative media consumption and vaccine uptake. Among people who consumed mostly conservative media and little else, the odds of being vaccinated and boosted were significantly lower. But among those who mixed conservative media with liberal or centrist sources, the likelihood of being vaccinated was higher—even if they still favored right-leaning outlets overall.

A similar pattern emerged in analyses of trust in science. Conservative media use was associated with lower trust in scientific institutions. Yet this effect was less pronounced for people who consumed a wider variety of news sources. Unexpectedly, ideological diversity on its own was slightly associated with lower trust in science.",2025-04-22 10:02:47,6,mvea,science

mohw90o,1k52km9,reddit,"I would strongly disagree that social media has anything to do with it. I mean, conservative Republicans have had less trust in the federal Government for over a half century. Those scientists during Covid were closely associated with the Government unfortunately.

**Pew Research Center (2019)**: Data from the American National Election Studies (ANES) shows that in 1958, 73% of Americans, including Republicans, trusted the government to do what is right ""just about always"" or ""most of the time.""

**Gallup (2020 Historical Trends)**: Trust in government plummeted across all groups after the Watergate scandal (1972-1974), but Republicans, especially conservatives, showed a sharper decline. By 1976, only 36% of Republicans trusted the government, compared to 55% of Democrats. Conservative Republicans, wary of federal regulation and bureaucracy, were particularly disillusioned by President Nixon’s resignation and subsequent Democratic policies under Carter.

**Statista (2024)**: Conservative trust in government fell from 66% in 1972 to 27% by 1980, driven by economic stagflation, energy crises, and distrust in federal economic management. The conservative wing of the Republican Party increasingly viewed government as inefficient and intrusive.

**American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2022)**: Ronald Reagan’s presidency (1981-1989) cemented conservative distrust in government. Reagan’s famous 1981 statement, “Government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem,” resonated with conservative Republicans.

**Pew Research Center (2023)**: The 1990s saw further erosion of conservative trust, particularly during the Clinton administration. The 1995-1996 government shutdowns, driven by Republican-led opposition to federal spending, highlighted conservative disdain for government overreach. By 1994, only 17% of Republicans trusted the government.

Since the 1960s, conservative Republicans have opposed federal expansion, from Great Society programs to modern regulatory frameworks, viewing them as infringing on individual liberty.",2025-04-22 20:52:22,1,SystematicHydromatic,science

mog43j7,1k52km9,reddit,"“Trust the science” is rich hahaha. 

The COVID-19 vaccine was one of the most poorly rolled out social experiments and late phase clinical trials of all time. The public was flat out lied to when it came to efficacy, safety, and due approval process. We were repeatedly gaslit by criminals posing as doctors (such as Fauci) about the vaccine as well as the origins of the virus, all while being slandered in the media as conspiracy theorists for questioning it. Not even for disagreeing, just asking questions. 

The covid-19 vaccine was generally “good” for its intended population: elderly and immunocompromised folks. But the CDC extended the demand to healthy adults and even children (who were not even getting symptomatic COVID-19). They falsely claimed that the vaccine would prevent the spread, and then moved the goalposts when that proved to be false in the country-wide clinical trial they conducted on all of us. The virus mutated and what started as an emergency approval turned into a bi-yearly shot that was being altered somehow behind closed doors. All for a virus that >99% of patients would go on to survive, even during the height of the pandemic in 2020-2021. There should never have been “mandated vaccinations” as conditions for continued employment or attendance of college courses, especially considering the vaccine did not stop the spread.

The vaccine was also not properly screened for side effects, and when adverse events popped up as a direct result of taking it, they were ignored. Suppressed. Manipulated by the media and CDC. Disclaimers were not given to recipients of the vaccine. This is not how clinical trial pharmaceutical material is assessed, any and all adverse effects are investigated thoroughly and disclosed to the public. 

“Trust the science” is sheep talk for people who have never taken a science course beyond 11th grade intro physics. I’m a scientist and engineer, I do science for a living. There was no proper science to trust with the COVID-19 vaccine. It was a country-wide clinical trial where you all were test subjects, and it was a stupidly profitable business venture for Pfizer and Moderna. That’s why it wasn’t stopped, and that’s why people are so much more mistrusting of vaccines than they ever were pre-Pandemic.

Sex differences in romantic love: an evolutionary perspective

https://bsd.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13293-025-00698-4

From the linked article: 

Men fall in love slightly more often than women, but women obsess about their partner more than men, according to a first-of-its-kind study investigating the differences between sexes from The Australian National University (ANU).

Lead author and ANU PhD student, Adam Bode,  said that while previous studies have researched the difference in romantic love between the sexes, this is the first to do it with people currently in love.

“This is the first study to investigate differences between women and men experiencing romantic love, using a relatively large cross-cultural sample. It is the first convincing evidence that women and men differ in some aspects of romantic love,” he said.

“The study spans across 33 different countries in Europe, North America and South Africa.

“We’re most interested in whether biological sex influences the occurrence, progression, and expression of romantic love.”

The results revealed that men fall in love, on average, about one month earlier than women, women experience romantic love slightly more intensely, and women think about their loved ones more than men.",2025-04-15 10:00:03,443,mvea,science

IIRC subsequent research has shown that season of birth does have an effect on various outcomes.  Some of those effects might be an artifact of an earlier era.

I agree with another commenter that this article just looks like p-hacking/torturing the data until it confesses.

The association between weekend warrior physical activity pattern and anxiety: evidence from a U.S. population-based study

https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-025-06612-x

Conclusion

The WW pattern was associated with a lower risk of anxiety. For individuals unable to exercise consistently throughout the week, the WW pattern offers a practical alternative for reducing the risk of anxiety, particularly among those with lower income levels or diabetes.

From the linked article:

How Weekend Exercise Can Fight Anxiety

Longer weekend workouts can help lower anxiety risk all week long.

Key points:

- A new study examines the effect of long weekend exercise sessions on anxiety.

- ""Weekend warriors"" had a 35 percent lower risk of anxiety than inactive people.

- Total weekly activity volume matters more than workout frequency.

- Even one to two days of exercise per week can have mental health benefits.

If you're too busy or stressed to work out during the week but have more time to exercise on weekends, there's good news. A new study (Chen et al., 2025), recently published in BMC Psychiatry, suggests that only exercising on Saturdays or Sundays (a.k.a. the ""weekend warrior"" physical activity pattern) can significantly lower your risk of experiencing anxiety throughout the week.

In terms of unleashing cardio's anxiolytic power, the researchers found that, on average, when people met weekly recommended physical activity guidelines of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous cardiorespiratory activity within a seven-day period, it didn't matter if they spread their workouts across several days or packed them into just one or two.

These first-of-their-kind findings suggest that even if your schedule only allows for ""weekend warrior"" workouts on Saturdays and Sundays, you can still reap the anxiety-reducing benefits of physical activity.",2025-03-31 00:59:02,54,mvea,science

mnl7pjt,1k1dxwq,reddit,"From the [article](https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/climate-change-will-make-rice-toxic-say-researchers/): Rice, the world’s most consumed grain, will become increasingly toxic as the atmosphere heats and as carbon dioxide emissions rise, potentially putting billions of people at risk of cancers and other diseases, according to [new research](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2542-5196%2825%2900055-5) published Wednesday in The Lancet.

Eaten every day by billions of people and grown across the globe, rice is arguably the planet’s most important staple crop, with half the world’s population relying on it for the majority of its food needs, especially in developing countries.

But the way rice is grown—mostly submerged in paddies—and its highly porous texture mean it can absorb unusually high levels of arsenic, a potent carcinogenic toxin that is especially dangerous for babies.

Lewis Ziska, a plant physiologist and associate professor at Columbia University, has studied rice for three decades and has more recently focused his research on how climate change reduces nutrient levels across many staple crops, including rice. He teamed up with researchers from China and the US to conduct a first-of-its-kind study, looking at how a range of rice species reacted to increases in temperature and carbon dioxide, both of which are projected to occur as more greenhouse gas emissions are released into the atmosphere as a result of human activities. The new study was published in The Lancet Planetary Health.",2025-04-17 14:18:56,352,chrisdh79,science

Abstract

Spontaneous mind wandering has been implicated as a feature of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and researchers have wondered if spontaneous remembering is also a feature of ADHD. In this study, we compared spontaneous cognition, principally involuntary autobiographical memories, in participants who scored inside the ADHD range on BAARS-IV to those who scored outside of the ADHD range. In Study 1, participants reported their involuntary memories and spontaneous thoughts on a laboratory measure of involuntary memory (the vigilance task), as well as estimated their daily involuntary memory frequencies on a separate questionnaire. The results showed that ADHD range participants did not differ from non-ADHD range participants in reports of involuntary memories and spontaneous thoughts on the vigilance task, but ADHD range participants estimated higher daily involuntary memory frequencies than non-ADHD range participants on the questionnaire. Additionally, on the questionnaire, ADHD participants reported that their involuntary memories were less positive and more repetitive than non-ADHD participants. In Study 2, participants recorded their naturally occurring involuntary memories in a structured diary for 48 hours. The results showed that ADHD range participants had more involuntary memories than non-ADHD range participants, and they also reported that they experienced them as less positive.

From the linked article: 

People with ADHD symptoms report more involuntary memories in daily life

A new study published in the British Journal of Psychology has found that individuals who report symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder tend to experience more involuntary memories in everyday life than those without such symptoms. These spontaneous recollections were also rated as less positive and more repetitive.

The results of this first study showed no difference in the number of spontaneous memories reported during the laboratory task between those with ADHD symptoms and those without. However, the questionnaire responses painted a different picture. Participants who scored in the ADHD range estimated that they experienced significantly more involuntary memories in their daily lives compared to the other groups. They also described these memories as being less positive and more repetitive. These findings suggest that while laboratory settings may not always detect variations in spontaneous memory experiences, self-reported everyday experiences can reveal meaningful differences.",2025-04-10 14:07:18,36,mvea,science
mmf9hn5,1jvypym,reddit,"Ah this is me haha. 

Ive often wondered why I have these intrusive memories, as all of them are unpleasant, super cringe and not my finest - I somehow am always the anti hero of my own memories, even if I wouldn’t ever place that kind of label on anyone else. 

I’ve tried to pinpoint what triggers them, ie if I’ve seen or heard something that day that I didn’t process in the moment… something that triggered a 20 year old cringe memory to pop up when I fall into a state of stillness, zen or rest. I used to try to do a meditation at home to unwind, and the cringe moments would pop up, just like they did as I tried to fall asleep. I notice it tends to happen more when I’m stressed. 

Since there is a blanket societal tendency to silo or  categorize stress into distinct buckets to differentiate (I.e psychological, physical/environmental or emotional; perceived vs actual), I tend to forget that stress is stress to our bodies; the body as a whole can’t identify a real threat vs an imagined one, just as it can’t tell what is causing the stress (environmental emotional, psychological), all it can do is respond to the signals it’s given. 

I wonder if the little neural pathways our brain creates could just be firing off a “danger! be wary” warning (intrusive memory) as it has detected a stress response (high stress levels or anxiety).

Since information is difficult to process or digest when anxious or highly stressed, the warning only comes through when I’m at rest and it can pop up for me to observe it play it back - even if I don’t want it to haha.",2025-04-10 17:39:38,14,URAQT,science

So on Earth this is mainly created by life… but that doesn’t mean it is on exoplanets, and in fact the lead authors explain this carefully. 

I think it’s very important to remember that most scientific discoveries are not immediate slam dunks, but rather happen with intermediate steps. Think about water on Mars as an example- I remember when they first found proof that there might have been water on Mars but it wasn’t conclusive, then they found better and more signatures, then evidence there used to be oceans… and today everyone agrees there’s water on Mars.

Similarly, if looking for these signatures, the first are not conclusive because there are alternate possibilities still. But then you find a little more, and even more… and before you know it we all agree there’s life elsewhere in the universe (though what puts it out there is far less clear).

My biggest issue is that the highest category of meat consumers they have is 400g per week and 56% of study participants fell into that category.

I'd want to see data specifically breaking the study participants into groups which consumed a higher percentage of poultry vs. beef rather than just looking at the total amount of poultry consumed before I'd reach any conclusions.

I'm certainly willing to believe that poultry consumption could cause cancer in general or specific cancers at higher rates than beef but that seems to go against most other studies.",2025-04-24 12:04:40,379,shawnkfox,science
morscoo,1k6poea,reddit,"Interesting study and definitely something worth looking into. However, increasing age is one of the highest risks for cancer in general and this study was predominantly done on an older population ""The mean age of the 3841 participants still alive was 65.40 (±13.24) years, and the oldest subject was 105 years as of 31 December 2024. The mean age at death was 81.09 years (±10.8), 82.71 (±10.27) for women and 79.94 (±10.84) for men."" 

The other issue this study was done via questionnaire so whether or not it could evaluate other risk factors for cancer, i.e. smoking, alcohol consumption, is questionable. The authors themselves said, ""Our study did not include a measure of physical activity, a potentially serious limitation given previous research findings linking physical activity with all causes and cause-specific mortality. The only way to indirectly measure the physical activity could have been the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). However, this instrument has only been validated for the 18–69 age group, i.e., middle age \[54\], which is far from our mean age. Therefore, the absence of this information did not allow us to include this variable as a potential confounder in the model. Thus, we may have overestimated or underestimated the effect of diet due to a confounding or effect modification of physical activity \[55\].""

mosb7gz,1k6poea,reddit,"Cool study insight, but a few take home points below that are going to be applicable to any survey based 20+ year study.	

Exercise was MIA. The study had zero data on physical activity. Regular movement slashes GI-cancer risk, so if couch-potato tendencies cluster with high-chicken diets, that alone could goose the stats.

Cooking style matters. High-heat grilling or rotisserie chicken pumps out heterocyclic amines and PAHs (nasty mutagens). The food-frequency survey lumped all poultry together, so gently poached breast counted the same as charred wings.

Socio-economic ghosts. Cheap battery-farm chicken is a budget staple. Lower income = later screening, worse healthcare access, higher cancer mortality. Income wasn’t fully captured.

Portion fuzziness. People under-report “big” portions on food questionnaires. Nailing gram-per-week accuracy over 19 years? Yeah, right.

Reverse causation. Folks with early gut issues sometimes swap red meat for “lighter” chicken. If pre-cancer symptoms nudged diet changes, chicken looks guilty when it’s really a bystander.

Medications & bugs. No data on statins, aspirin, H. pylori infection—each one tweaks GI-cancer risk in its own way.

Body-fat pattern vs BMI. The study adjusted for BMI, not waist-size. Visceral fat is the real carcinogenic bad guy.

Small death counts + multiple comparisons. Only 108 GI-cancer deaths. Slice that by sex and intake quartiles and P-values can hop above or below 0.05 out of sheer randomness.

Hormones? Men got smacked harder than women. Estrogen receptors in the gut could offer ladies a protective buffer—or maybe men just drink more wine and eat bigger portions. Hard to tell.

⸻

Appropriate take-homes based on this 1 study

	1.	Chicken isn’t automatically “healthy red-meat-replacement.” Portion size, cooking method and overall diet still matter.

	2.	Rotate proteins—fish, legumes, eggs—and keep the grill marks light.

	3.	Hit your screenings, move your body, chill on the booze & cigs. Those shifts dwarf the effect size of any single food.

So yeah, interesting data point, but nobody needs to rage-quit poultry yet. Moderation, variety, and not torching your dinner are still king.",2025-04-24 13:32:48,23,Johnjoe1518,science

mosolk0,1k6poea,reddit,"**Observational = association, not causation**: This cannot prove poultry causes cancer. It can only suggest a link.  
  
**No cooking method or processing data**: We don’t know if the poultry was grilled (producing HCAs and PAHs), processed (which often contains nitrates), or simply roasted. These are critical confounders. Prior research has tied processing and high-heat cooking more strongly to cancer than poultry itself.  
  
**No total dietary pattern control**: They adjust for some variables, but they don’t fully account for dietary context, was high poultry intake part of a poor diet? Did they eat few vegetables or lots of fried/starchy foods? Those are potential confounders.  
  
**Specific to an older, regional population**: The findings may not generalize to younger populations or to people with different dietary patterns (like in the UK, US, or Nordic countries).  
  
**SHRs aren’t that high**: A subdistribution hazard ratio of ~2.2 isn’t trivial, but it’s not off the charts.

moxqg6g,1k6poea,reddit,"Observational studies like this are important, because it's only really through observational data that we can look at decades of a human's life, for sample sizes in the 4, 5, or even 6-digit range. However, observational studies aren't interventional, so without appropriately adjusting for confounding variables, they're not reliable for making causal conclusions.

The big paragraph in Section 2.5 of the methods section describes the six models they used for statistical analysis, and how they adjusted for various confounding variables. I'm not a statistician by any means, so I'll admit I don't fully understand what they're talking about when they mention Cox models or Schoenfeld residuals. But it looks like they adjusted for a good variety of confounding variables, like sex, cholesterol, blood glucose, hypertension/diabetes, among others.

However, smoking seems to have only been qualified as ever vs current, rather than quantified. And, I think most importantly, they didn't adjust for anything like weight, BMI, body fat %, or being overweight/obese. If people who eat >300g of poultry per week are getting higher rates of gastric cancers, how much of that increased risk is because of the proportion of poultry in their diet, and how much is because of the fact that they've been overweight/obese for years or even decades? People who are overweight/obese are eating more - larger portions and/or more often. Is a fit and active person who eats 600g of chicken per week, split across 3-4 meals, at the same risk level as an overweight person who's getting 600g of chicken per week, split across  2 meals?

They also didn't seem to adjust for the rest of their diet, aside from meat consumption. Veg/fruit/whole grain/legume/fiber intake, intake of added sugars/refined grains/saturated fat, etc. I think it's reasonable to at least consider that the people who are eating the most meat per week, on average, are eating less fiber than those eating less meat per week. And the research behind fiber intake and its protective effects against colorectal cancer (which falls under gastric cancer) is well established at this point.

Anyway, just my thoughts. Don't want to make it seem like I'm bashing the study, they call it preliminary in the title and acknowledge many of the limitations in the discussion section.",2025-04-25 08:21:06,2,_V115_,science

morpybp,1k6poea,reddit,"""**Abstract**

**Background**: Poultry meat is currently among the most widely consumed meats in Italy and worldwide. Poultry is reasonably affordable and accessible, explaining the high global consumption rates. This population-based prospective cohort study investigated the association between meat consumption and gastrointestinal cancers (GCs) and other causes of mortality in southern Italy. **Methods**: Data were collected from 4869 participants in the MICOL and NUTRIHEP cohorts. The EPIC questionnaire was used to elicit information on food and drink consumption. For analytical purposes, weekly meat consumption was grouped into four categories: total meat: <200 g, 201–300 g, 301–400 g, and >400 g red meat: <150 g, 150–250 g, 251–350 g, and >350 g; poultry: <100 g, 100–200 g, 201–300 g, and >300 g. Cox proportional hazard regression and competing risk models were employed for statistical analysis. **Results**: Analyzing weekly poultry consumption, it was observed that subjects consuming more than 300 g had a 27% higher risk of death from all causes \[HR 1.27; 95% CI (1.00; 1.61)\] than those consuming less than 100 g. In addition, for GCs, the SHR for weekly poultry consumption above 300 g was 2.27 \[95% CI (1.23; 4.17)\], a risk that for men increased to 2.61 \[95% CI (1.31; 5.19)\]. **Conclusions**: Our study showed that poultry consumption above 300 g/week is associated with a statistically significant increased mortality risk both from all causes and from GCs. The risk is higher for men than for women.""",2025-04-24 11:18:59,5,James_Fortis,science

“In our previous study, we showed how combining the consumption of red meat with a portion of broadleaf vegetables reduced the risks associated with meat consumption. This effect was not observed for white meat; despite our sample’s adherence to the Mediterranean diet, which includes the regular consumption of vegetables at every main meal, the risks remain unchanged. This leads us to suggest a different pathogenic mechanism for white meat than red meat, likely linked to the type of animal feed and how the animals are raised. However, further studies are required to support this hypothesis.”

mnd3pkh,1k0czxd,reddit,"**Modelling Female Breast Motion During Running: Implications of Breast Support on the Spine**

ABSTRACT

During running, it is difficult to control breast motion and change torso motion or vice versa within empirical data collection. This study investigated how different levels of breast support (and consequently breast motion) influence torso motion, breast forces, lumbar and thoracic spinal moments during running, using a computer simulation model. A subject-specific female full body musculoskeletal model with an articulated thoracolumbar spine and sliding joints between the breasts and torso to enable breast motion was customised for this study. One female (bra size 34DD) had 59 markers attached to anatomical locations and ran over three force platforms at a self-selected speed (3.15–3.40 m/s) in three breast support conditions (no bra, everyday bra and sports bra). An ‘extreme’ bra condition was simulated during the modelling process by eliminating all breast motion relative to the torso. Two categories of simulations were run, investigating 1) how different breast support garments affect torso motion, breast and spinal moments; and 2) how changes in torso motion affect breast and spinal moments. Key findings suggest that peak lumbar and thoracic spine moments demonstrate changes (> 0.05 Nm/kg) between bra conditions due to changes in running gait kinematics. Additionally, eliminating breast motion relative to the torso, but using the same input running gait kinematics, increased (> 0.05 Nm/kg) lumbar joint moments. Therefore, it is possible that bras aimed at preventing relative motion between the torso and breasts may increase internal loading within the spine.

mmjdzvl,1jwlnej,reddit,"Headline very overblown. 

They find a statistically significant association between retinal findings and existing questionnaire-based Alzheimer disease risk - ie, tools *that already predicts middle age AD risk*! Some of these have been around for nearly two decades.

They do not calculate risk of AD based on retinal findings. We don’t really care about a raw *association*, which we would expect - we care about how good a predictor it is, alone or in addition (ie via improving) these existing tools. BMI is strongly *associated* with AD risk, but it doesn't mean it's useful predictor on its own.

They do not look at actual AD development. The “ground truth” is the risk result on these existing questionnaires, ignoring any performance issues for those questionnaires in predicting AD risk.

They do not look at the addition of retinal findings to these existing AD risk questionnaires.

The fact that retinal findings associate with the results of these questionnaires is not surprising. Cardiometabolic health, eg, is a very strong predictor of retinal health and AD risk (and is assessed in these questionnaires; eg the [CAIDE index](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422\(06\)70537-3/fulltext) is based on age, education, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, obesity).

From the linked article: 

A new study published in Heliyon has found that people who experienced abuse, neglect, or domestic abuse during childhood have a significantly higher risk of developing certain chronic immune disorders later in life—specifically, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. The association was particularly strong among women, raising questions about how early life adversity may shape lifelong health outcomes.

The researchers aimed to investigate how early exposure to abuse might relate to the development of immune-mediated inflammatory disorders, a group of chronic illnesses that includes rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, and inflammatory bowel diseases.

The analysis revealed that people exposed to childhood maltreatment had a 39% higher risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis and a 16% higher risk of developing psoriasis compared to those without such exposure. These associations held even after adjusting for factors such as age, sex, and socioeconomic status. Notably, the increased risk was more pronounced in women. For example, women who had experienced childhood maltreatment were 54% more likely to be diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, while the increase in risk for men was not statistically significant.",2025-04-14 12:04:05,59,mvea,science

The oversimplified version is a shift in how the brain processes information, leading to distortions to produce emotional states more likely to achieve safety with important figures. While adaptive in some contexts, in other contexts (like adulthood) they can be maladaptive.  

It is well understood how to assess these disruptions formally (adult attachment interview for adults) and address them from a psychotherapeutic lens (attachment integrated psychotherapy).

What is most significantly lacking at this point is awareness. Attachment is, if you’re lucky, a one lecture topic in one course (intro to developmental psych) in first or second year undergrad, and has no mention of connection to pathology, relationship issues, other life outcomes, or even adulthood in general.

From the relatively mild of chronic ulcers which are not caused by stress but an extremophile bacteria H. pylori (curable with antibiotics!), to Multiple Sclerosis, which is a progressive disease that destroys the myelin sheaths of nerves, not hysteria. 

If your doctor tells you your condition is due to any of the following, have a discussion about your concerns being dismissed: health anxiety, conversion disorder, psychosomatic illness, hypochondria, Munchausen's. They're all just ways to dismiss patients who aren't easily treated, and you'll get punted back and forth between different specialties while you spend years suffering and pay for the experience.

Is beard the male makeup? An experimental study on trust perception based on appearance

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001691825000551

From the linked article: 

Facial hair influences trust and attractiveness—but only among a specific group of men

Facial hair can influence how much people trust you—but the effects depend on age and beard style. A new study published in Acta Psychologica found that young men with light stubble were perceived as more attractive, and as a result, they were trusted with more money in a trust-based economic game. However, these effects were not seen for older men or those with full beards.. The research adds nuance to popular beliefs about the so-called “beauty premium,” showing that physical appearance only enhances trust under specific conditions.

The “beauty premium” refers to the idea that attractive individuals tend to receive more favorable treatment in a range of social and economic situations. Studies have found that attractive people are more likely to be hired, earn higher wages, and receive more lenient treatment in court. These advantages may also extend to interpersonal trust.

The results showed no overall effect of beard type on trust. However, older-looking trustees received more money than younger-looking ones, regardless of their facial hair. This supported the idea that age on its own boosts perceived trustworthiness.

But when breaking down the results further, a more complex pattern emerged. Among younger trustees, those with light stubble received significantly more money than their clean-shaven or fully bearded peers. This effect was not present for older trustees.

Attractiveness ratings followed a similar pattern. Trustees with light stubble were rated as more attractive than clean-shaven ones, and slightly more attractive than those with full beards. Again, these effects were only seen in younger faces. Among older-looking trustees, beard style did not influence perceived attractiveness.

To explore whether attractiveness explained the boost in trust for younger men with stubble, the researchers conducted a statistical mediation analysis. They found that the increase in trust was indirectly driven by increased attractiveness. In other words, the light stubble made young men appear more attractive, and this attractiveness led participants to trust them with more money. No such mediation effect was observed for older men or for other beard styles.",2025-04-19 20:43:58,35,mvea,science

Abstract

Widespread adoption of Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists could cause significant changes in food consumption and preferences that disrupt the food industry. In this study, we survey four consumer groups to better understand how GLP-1 s may affect food consumption and preferences. The four groups were: 1) consumers currently using a GLP-1, 2) consumers who have previously used a GLP-1, 3) consumers who haven’t used a GLP-1 but plan to in the future, and 4) consumers who haven’t used a GLP-1 and don’t plan to in the future. Results show that consumers currently taking a GLP-1 consume significantly fewer calories than the other groups surveyed, and calorie reduction while taking a GLP-1 for weight loss could be around 720 to 990 cal. Additionally, those taking GLP-1 s most likely reduce consumption of processed foods, sugar-sweetened beverages, refined grains, and beef. The results of this study will inform potential consumers and food companies of valuable insights into the broader effects of GLP-1 s on caloric intake and food preferences.

From the linked article:

As a large proportion of people taking medications like Mounjaro, Ozempic and Wegovy for weight loss report consuming less processed foods and soda, researchers say food and beverage companies are adjusting strategies.

The results of a recent national study conducted by the Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Station found that these weight loss drugs — known as Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists or GLP-1s — lead to new food and drink consumption patterns, which underscore observed changes in food and beverage marketing.

The study found that current and previous users of GLP-1s reported reduced consumption of most foods and beverages. The proportion of respondents reporting less consumption of processed foods was about 70 percent more than of those who reported consuming more. Similarly, there were about 50 percent more respondents who reported consuming less soda, refined grains and beef than those who reported consuming more of those foods.  There were also reductions in the consumption of starchy vegetables, pork, alcohol, fruit juice and dairy milk.

Chicken, coffee, fish and seafood, nuts, eggs, plant-based meat, whole grains and plant-based milk also saw a relatively smaller dip in consumption, ranging from 10 to 25 percent of respondents reporting decreases in consumption compared to increases.

Despite the declines, GLP-1 users reported a continued desire to consume processed foods, sodas, refined grains and beef.

Only fruits, leafy greens and water showed an overall increase in consumption.

“Our study shows that adoption of GLP-1 agonists changes both the amount and types of food people eat,” Lusk said. “These results have important implications for the food industry. If adoption of GLP-1s continues to increase, food companies will be challenged as demand for processed foods falls but will have opportunities as demand for fruits and vegetables increases.”",2025-04-09 11:57:31,29,mvea,science

The COVID-19 pandemic and current projections of rising health expenditures point to an impending sustainability crisis in US health care institutions, torn between competing demands of individualistic values (market justice) and collective values (social justice). Champions of individual responsibility are likely to favor a disease management model of health care – wherein the maintenance of lucrative food, medical, and pharmaceutical industries depends in large part on the creation and reproduction of an older but sicker consumer base, with survival to old age contingent on individuals’ capacity to pay for tests, treatments, and prescriptions. In contrast, proponents of community solidarity favor a health promotion model emphasizing primordial prevention – focused upstream on improvements in nutrition and in living and working conditions potentially capable of forestalling the onset of disease in the first place. In the end, health system sustainability will hinge on policy makers’ readiness to recognize, and innovate in response to, deeply ingrained values of both individual responsibility and community solidarity. To foster long-term stability in health care, effective policy must strive toward meeting the following essential needs: (1) optimal population health, (2) consumer and provider satisfaction, (3) fiscally stable and affordable funding sources, and (4) replacement opportunities for jobs lost to restructuring.",2025-04-09 15:11:19,2,Van-garde,science

Why I am skeptical is that if these tests are being done in secret, how do we know they are doing them? Take TikTok content with a heaping ladle of salt, but it is interesting that IF TRUE in response to people eating healthier, instead of making snacks healthier, they just lace their food with more addictive substances to keep people hooked.",2025-04-10 05:43:22,1,Samwyzh,science

mmnwj05,1jv3yx6,reddit,"So, I’m talking a semiglutide. I haven’t cut out processed foods. In fact, I’m finding I’m able to buy it and have it in the house because I won’t consume it all immediately. For example, I got a container of doughnut holes (something I haven’t done in years). I was worried it would be gone in 2 days or less. It’s been a week. It’s not gone. I’ve had one or more here and there when I wanted some. The serving size is three and I’ve yet to go over the serving size when having them, even though the container is *right there* in front of me. Even when I’ve been hungry and short on time. It’s unbelievable, really! 

This week has been tough and I need to go out and get stuff for my salads or other healthier foods. Instead I got doughnut holes and mini sodas and sandwich stuff and coffee and bagels and cream cheese and frozen dinners and clementines and yogurt with toppings for myself this week. I still lost .2 pounds this week! Without the semi-glutide, I’m almost certain I would have gained. 

So, maybe the semi-glutide isn’t necessarily making everyone stay away from the less healthy foods, but just makes most much less likely to binge them, which lowers the overall intake of these foods for the American consumer when averaged out. Though, previously, I would generally avoid bringing “junk food” into my home, sometimes my husband would do so and/or every now and then I would decide to get such foods as an indulgence (ex. a small container of pastries), fully expecting it to not last more than a weekend. I’m shocked that I can now grab a container of doughnut holes and just have a couple now and put the rest of the container away then go days without a serving or even an alternative sweet without even trying. 

The other things I’d do before is grab too many of some sugary, high carb, high saturated fat item at an event or gathering. Now I think I could take a little and say “enough” to myself and - best of all - not keep thinking about the snacks I’ve left on the table. I bet there are many like me who can say the same. So, that means that people are probably buying less of these for gatherings and events and the profile of what food an average American consumer consumes has likely altered because of that too.",2025-04-12 01:27:12,1,BlueSky2777,science

I've been on (ozempic) 0.5 mg for 3 months, 1mg for 6 months and 1.5 mg for a month and while I've lost 10kg within that time, I lost it within the first 3 months and have since stagnated. No change in the things I crave. Better quality of food hasn't become more attractive and even my portion size is about the same with the difference that around 1-1.5h hours after eating I get that overgorged feeling of being like a stuffed turkey. Very unpleasant yes, but hard to appreciate when you're having a delicious meal and not getting satiated nowhere near the time of enjoying it. Albeit the beer part is somewhat true. Not in the sense of not wanting it, but having more than 2 really gets me stuffed because ingesting it hits that 1-1.5h timeframe.

My occupational healthcare provider really wants me to start eating small portions through out the day and I can imagine how that might help things along weight loss wise were I able to do it. The problem is that I have an unhealthy relationship with getting happy hormones from food and eating tiny portions never gets me any until I'm satiated and combating that pretty much drains me for anything else like an addict pining for a fix.

From the linked article: 

Newer classes of diabetes drugs that lower blood glucose, including drugs such as Ozempic, have been linked to a lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and other dementias in two studies by US and Irish scientists. One study looked at Alzheimer's diagnoses in patients taking the class of drugs that includes Ozempic, the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), in those taking another class of glucose-lowering drugs known as SGLT2is, and in those who took other glucose-lowering drugs. They found that patients taking the newer GLP-1RAs and the SGLT2is, had lower rates of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. A second study, which pooled together the results of previous clinical trials, found that GLP1-RAs, but not SGLT2is, were associated with a reduction in dementia or cognitive impairment.",2025-04-08 00:17:16,32,mvea,science

Abstract

Objective To evaluate systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of exercise on general cognition, memory and executive function across all populations and ages.

Methods Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs evaluating the effects of exercise on general cognition, memory and executive function were eligible. Data extraction and risk of bias scoring were conducted in duplicate. The A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews (AMSTAR-2) was used to assess the risk of bias. Effect sizes were pooled using random effects models and reported as standardised mean differences (SMD). Subgroup analyses were conducted for participant and intervention characteristics.

General cognition, memory and executive function.

Data sources CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, Embase, MEDLINE via OVID, Emcare, ProQuest Central, ProQuest Nursing and Allied Health Source, PsycINFO, Scopus, Sport Discus and Web of Science.

Results 133 systematic reviews (2,724 RCTs and 258 279 participants) were included. Exercise significantly improved general cognition (SMD=0.42), memory (SMD=0.26) and executive function (SMD=0.24). Memory and executive function improvements from exercise were greater for children and adolescents than for adults and older adults. Those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder exhibited greater improvement in executive function than other populations. Effects were generally larger for low- and moderate-intensity interventions. Shorter interventions (1–3 months) and exergames (video games that require physical movement) had the largest effects on general cognition and memory. Findings remained statistically significant after excluding reviews rated as low and critically low quality.

Conclusions These findings provide strong evidence that exercise, even light intensity, benefits general cognition, memory and executive function across all populations, reinforcing exercise as an essential, inclusive recommendation for optimising cognitive health.

Abstract

Some patients with chronic conditions are unreceptive to a psychological approach. This study aimed to explore the experience of Long Covid (LC) with an emphasis on patients’ beliefs about the role of psychology. UK participants (n = 14) with either self-reported or diagnosed LC took part in semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis described three main themes: ‘Living in uncertainty’, ‘Why should I trust you if you don’t believe me?’ and ‘Once I know the cause people will believe me’. Transcending these themes was a tension between professional experts and experts by lived experience and a dichotomy between psychological and medical explanations. Overarching all themes was a sense that synthesising the biological and psychological components of LC could help to resolve this tension. In summary. living with LC is characterised by feeling disbelieved which can drive the rejection of psychology. Helping patients feel listened to may encourage a more positive approach to psychological support.

From the linked article: 

Study finds long Covid patients feel pressure to prove their illness is real

People living with Long Covid often feel dismissed, disbelieved and unsupported by their healthcare providers, according to a new study from the University of Surrey. 

The study, which was published in the Journal of Health Psychology, looked at how patients with Long Covid experience their illness. The study found that many patients feel they have to prove their illness is physical to be taken seriously and, as a result, often reject psychological support, fearing it implies their symptoms are “all in the mind”.",2025-03-27 08:11:24,23,mvea,science

Other ones included: BMI, reported diabetes/hypertension, depression, smoking status, genetic pre-disposition, referral source. 

Seems like the biggest thing missing was controlling for parental status/having kids. Some of the other comments here about longevity hypothetically should be controlled for in this study given age controls. Diagnosis bias is also acknowledged by the study authors. They say:

>... it is possible that married individuals are more likely to seek a dementia evaluation and to be diagnosed at an earlier stage compared to those who are unmarried. The possibility that unmarried individuals are more likely to be delayed/missed diagnosed with dementia due to a lack of referrals from spouses raises concerns about the possibility of later-stage dementia diagnosis or undiagnosed dementia among unmarried individuals. Interestingly, however, the moderation analyses indicated that the associations were similar by age or referral source, with slightly weaker associations among individuals who were older and referred to the clinic by non-professionals, such as self, family, or friends. Furthermore, while the widowed were diagnosed at an older age and with slightly more severe symptoms compared to the other groups, the never-married and divorced did not differ from the married on the age or severity of impairment at the time of diagnosis. Overall, it is unclear why such bias (delayed diagnosis in the unmarried) would affect the findings from the NACC and no other studies.

https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70072

Highlights

Widowed, divorced, and never-married older adults had a lower dementia risk, compared to their married counterparts.

Unmarried older adults were also at a lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease and Lewy body dementia, with a pattern of mixed findings for frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and no associations with risk of vascular dementia or mild cognitive impairment.

All unmarried groups were at a lower risk of progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia.

From the linked article: 

Dementia Is More Common Among the Married Than the Unmarried

Unmarried people are at least 50% less likely to experience cognitive decline.

KEY POINTS

Recent research found that people who were not married were less at risk than married people for dementia.

The bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City (OKC) on April 19, 1995 – almost 30 years ago to the day – resulted in the deaths of 168 people and injured several hundred more. It’s regarded as the deadliest act of homegrown terrorism in US history.

We know that surviving such a traumatic event leaves physical and psychological scars, but what effect does it have on the body’s biology? New research led by the University of Oklahoma (OU) suggests that the body continues to “remember” trauma long after it’s happened, even if physical and psychological issues have been resolved.

“The main takeaway from the study is that the mind may be resilient and be able to put things behind it, but the body doesn’t forget,” said Phebe Tucker, MD, professor emeritus of psychiatry at OU’s College of Medicine and the study’s lead author. “It may remain on alert, waiting for the next thing to happen.",2025-04-13 10:24:47,7,chrisdh79,science

morh513,1k6oht7,reddit,"A new analysis of school shootings in the U.S. suggests that most shooters had a social background in which guns were a key leisure item, with attached meanings of bonding and affection, which also translated into easy access to firearms. Anne Nassauer of the University of Erfurt, Germany, presents these findings in the open-access journal PLOS One on April 23, 2025.

For U.S. minors, guns are the leading cause of death. Some of these deaths occur in school shootings, where a current or former student fires at people at their school. Discussions of school shootings often cite the unique gun culture of the U.S. as a causative factor. However, few studies have methodically analyzed the role of gun culture in school shooters’ lives.

To address this gap, Nassauer analyzed all known U.S. school shootings across U.S. history (83 cases), some of which resulted in no deaths, some in a few deaths, and some in many. Using data from court, police, and media records, she assembled a case file for each shooter and conducted cross-case and statistical comparisons to determine whether any patterns in gun culture emerged.

The analysis suggests that a distinct pocket of U.S. gun culture plays a key role in school shooters’ lives. Specifically, most shooters in the study came from a social background in which guns were key leisure items that were often important for family bonding time, often from a young age. Some shooters described guns as being their “only friend” or the “love of \[their\] life.”

Notably, all shooters in the study faced no difficulty in obtaining the guns they used in the school shootings. The analysis suggests that this ease of access stemmed from the cultural meanings assigned to guns within the shooters’ social settings—namely, fun, bonding, and belonging—which translated into practices that made accessing guns easy. For instance, some parents had bought the guns their children then used for the school shooting, while others kept guns in easily accessible parts of their house.

Abstract

Natural spoken communication happens instantaneously. Speech delays longer than a few seconds can disrupt the natural flow of conversation. This makes it difficult for individuals with paralysis to participate in meaningful dialogue, potentially leading to feelings of isolation and frustration. Here we used high-density surface recordings of the speech sensorimotor cortex in a clinical trial participant with severe paralysis and anarthria to drive a continuously streaming naturalistic speech synthesizer. We designed and used deep learning recurrent neural network transducer models to achieve online large-vocabulary intelligible fluent speech synthesis personalized to the participant’s preinjury voice with neural decoding in 80-ms increments. Offline, the models demonstrated implicit speech detection capabilities and could continuously decode speech indefinitely, enabling uninterrupted use of the decoder and further increasing speed. Our framework also successfully generalized to other silent-speech interfaces, including single-unit recordings and electromyography. Our findings introduce a speech-neuroprosthetic paradigm to restore naturalistic spoken communication to people with paralysis.

From the linked article: 

Brain implant translates thoughts to speech in an instant

Improvements to brain–computer interfaces are bringing the technology closer to natural conversation speed.

A brain-reading implant that translates neural signals into audible speech has allowed a woman with paralysis to hear what she intends to say nearly instantly.

Researchers enhanced the device — known as a brain–computer interface (BCI) — with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms that decoded sentences as the woman thought of them, and then spoke them out loud using a synthetic voice. Unlike previous efforts, which could produce sounds only after users finished an entire sentence, the current approach can simultaneously detect words and turn them into speech within three seconds.

Brain-reading devices allow paralysed people to talk using their thoughts

The findings, published in Nature Neuroscience on 31 March, represent a big step towards BCIs that are of practical use.

Older speech-generating BCIs are similar to “a WhatsApp conversation”, says Christian Herff, a computational neuroscientist at Maastricht University, the Netherlands, who was not involved with the work. “I write a sentence, you write a sentence and you need some time to write a sentence again… It just doesn’t flow like a normal conversation.”

BCIs that stream speech in real time are “the next level” in research because they allow users to convey the tone and emphasis that are characteristic of natural speech, he adds.",2025-03-31 18:12:12,76,mvea,science

Abstract

While cold acclimation can enhance thermoregulation in humans, the potential to improve cellular cold tolerance remains unknown. Thus, this work aims to evaluate the effect of a 7-day cold-water acclimation on the cytoprotective mechanism of autophagy in young males. Further, this work assesses changes in cellular cold tolerance by employing hypothermic ex vivo (whole blood) cooling prior to and following acclimation. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells are isolated before and after cold exposures on days 1, 4, and 7 of acclimation and following ex vivo cooling. Proteins associated with autophagy, apoptosis, the heat shock response, and inflammation are analyzed via Western blotting. Indicators of autophagic dysfunction paired with increased apoptotic signaling are prevalent at the beginning of acclimation. At the end of acclimation, autophagic activity increased while apoptotic and inflammatory signaling decreased. Although an elevated heat shock response is observed following cold exposure, this does not change throughout the acclimation. Further, improvements of autophagic activity are observed during ex vivo cooling along with a reduction of apoptotic signaling, albeit still elevated compared to basal levels. This work shows that 7-day cold acclimation elicits improvements in cellular cold tolerance in young males through enhanced autophagic responses concomitant with reductions in apoptotic signaling.

Cold plunges actually change your cells, uOttawa study finds

A new study conducted at the Human and Environmental Physiology Research labnorth_eastexternal link (HEPRU) at the University of Ottawa has unveiled significant findings on the effects of cold water acclimation on autophagic (the cells’ recycling system, which promotes cellular health) and apoptotic (the programmed cell death that gets rid of damaged cells) responses in young males. The research highlights the potential for cold exposure to enhance cellular resilience against stress.

The study, conducted by Kelli Kingnorth_eastexternal link, postdoctoral fellow, and Glen Kenny, Full Professor at uOttawa’s School of Human Kinetics and Director of HEPRU, involved ten healthy young males who underwent cold-water immersion at 14°C (57.2°F) for one hour across seven consecutive days. Blood samples were collected to analyze the participants' cellular responses before and after the acclimation period.

“Our findings indicate that repeated cold exposure significantly improves autophagic function, a critical cellular protective mechanism,” says Professor Kenny. “This enhancement allows cells to better manage stress and could have important implications for health and longevity.”",2025-03-29 12:06:36,7,mvea,science

The only issue I find is with the article's use of toxic without explanation - even though that's what many nanoplastics are as they damage DNA, mess with protein pathways, cause oxidative stress, precipitate protein and cholesterol plaques, and damage phospholipid membranes.

Microplastics found in human ovary follicular fluid for the first time

Peer-reviewed study’s findings raises fresh question on the toxic substances’ impact on fertility

Microplastics have been found for the first time in human ovary follicular fluid, raising a new round of questions about the ubiquitous and toxic substances’ potential impact on women’s fertility.

The new peer-reviewed research published in Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety checked for microplastics in the follicular fluid of 18 women undergoing assisted reproductive treatment at a fertility clinic in Salerno, Italy, and detected them in 14.

Follicular fluid provides essential nutrients and biochemical signals for developing eggs. Contaminating that process with bits of plastic quite likely has implications for fertility, hormonal balance and overall reproductive health, the authors wrote.

The findings represent a major step toward figuring out how and why microplastics impact women’s reproductive health, but are also “very alarming”, Luigi Montano, a researcher at the University of Rome and study lead author, said.

“This discovery should serve as an important warning signal about the invasiveness of these emerging contaminants in the female reproductive system,” the study states.",2025-04-19 12:00:07,99,mvea,science

mk6x8vc,1jlwp6o,reddit,"From the press release:

People with autism are typically diagnosed by clinical observation and assessment. To deconstruct the clinical decision process, which is often subjective and difficult to describe, researchers used a large language model (LLM) to synthesize the behaviors and observations that are most indicative of an autism diagnosis. Their results, publishing in the Cell Press journal Cell, show that repetitive behaviors, special interests, and perception-based behaviors are most associated with an autism diagnosis. These findings have potential to improve diagnostic guidelines for autism by decreasing the focus on social factors—which the established guidelines in the DSM-5 focus on but the model did not classify among the most relevant in diagnosing autism. 

“Our goal was not to suggest that we could replace clinicians with AI tools for diagnosis,” says senior author Danilo Bzdok (@danilobzdok) of the Mila Québec Artificial Intelligence Institute and McGill University in Montreal. “Rather, we sought to quantitatively define exactly what aspects of observed behavior or patient history a clinician uses to reach a final diagnostic determination. In doing so, we hope to empower clinicians to work with diagnostic instruments that are more in line with their empirical realities.”

>The team developed a bespoke LLM module that pinpointed specific sentences in the reports that were most relevant to a correct diagnosis prediction.

The big problem is most people think AI is all just like ChatGPT. Those types of AI are like a ""Swiss army knife"", great for a variety of uses, but poor for specific uses. You wouldn't ask a surgeon to do an operation with a ""Swiss army knife"". So the AI model used really does matter, and it will take some time to get the proper models implemented in each industry.

mkwzov3,1jozjsn,reddit,"I think the bigger thing to take away is that difference between black people and white people is big enough to throw off a model designed to generalize(to an extent). An enlarged heart should be an enlarged heart. Presumably the model was not fed racial or gender information during training. As such they probably compared to the general average rather than the average per grouping. They should redo the original training but feed in demographic data with the scan. 


Edit: or a fine-tuning with the demographic data. 


Edit2: perhaps instead of demographic data they could use genetic information. But the variance in heart size or other such data is probably influenced by both lifestyle and genetics. Idk what would be the best data to add in to correct for this sort of thing. Just racial data would likely miss certain things. For example if a white guy who identifies as white was 1/64th native would that 1/64 be enough to throw off AI diagnostics? If so how could we correct for that?

Abstract

Hearing remains an underexplored aspect of human evolution. While the growing prevalence of hearing issues worldwide highlights the need to investigate factors beyond age, ototoxic substances, and recreational noise— factors affecting only a subset of the population —the role of environmental influences remains relatively unaddressed. In contrast, hearing and vocalizations have been extensively studied in many vertebrates through the Acoustic Adaptation Hypothesis, which suggests that acoustic communication adapts to the structure of the immediate environment. To explore how the environment shapes the ear’s ability to process sound, studying the cochlea is essential since it is responsible for capturing, amplifying, and converting sound waves into electrical signals. Cochlear sensitivity can be measured using Transient-Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions (TEOAE), which assess the cochlea’s ability to produce and transmit an acoustic response after sound stimulation. By analyzing TEOAE profiles, we gain valuable insights into how the cochlea responds to external auditory stimuli. We evaluated the influence of both endogenous (age, sex, ear side) and exogenous factors (ethnicity, environment, language) on cochlear sensitivity by collecting TEOAE data from 448 healthy individuals across 13 global populations in Ecuador, England, Gabon, South Africa, and Uzbekistan, living in diverse environments. For each individual, we derived six acoustic metrics from these TEOAE profiles to characterize the amplitude and frequency spectrum of cochlear sensitivity. Our results show that amplitude is primarily influenced by sex (up to 2 dB) and environment (up to 3.6 dB), followed by age and ear side. The frequency spectrum is determined exclusively by exogenous factors, with environment— particularly altitude, and urban versus rural settings —being the most significant. These findings challenge existing assumptions and highlight the need to consider both biological and environmental factors when studying auditory processes.

From the linked article: 

A new study of hearing sensitivity across global populations has revealed that women consistently have more sensitive hearing than men—by about two decibels on average—regardless of age or where they live. The researchers also found that the local environment plays a significant role in shaping how our ears respond to different sound frequencies. The study, published in Scientific Reports, suggests that both biological and environmental factors influence human hearing more than previously thought.

The results were striking. Across all 13 populations, women had more sensitive hearing than men—by about two decibels on average. This pattern held across all tested frequencies, not just at high frequencies where earlier studies had noted differences. The researchers suggest that this may reflect a universal biological trait rather than a culturally specific pattern. They point to possible causes such as hormonal influences during development or subtle structural differences in the cochlea between sexes.",2025-03-29 19:14:31,47,mvea,science

mkfiw7q,1jmtsl2,reddit,"does it have to do with allometric scaling? Smaller animals have **relatively more surface area** compared to their volume. Women are on average smaller than men.

Maybe this affects hearing. Maybe the ear pinnae and ear drum membrane can capture more sound waves with more surface area.



I asked Chatgpt if allometric scaling affects hearing in animals:

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Here are some ways allometric scaling can influence hearing:*

# 1. Ear Size and Shape:

* **Outer Ear (Pinna)**: The size and shape of the outer ear, which funnels sound into the ear canal, can scale differently with the body size. Larger animals may have proportionally smaller pinnae compared to their body size than smaller animals. The size and shape of the outer ear help determine the **directionality** of sound and the ability to capture and focus sound waves.
* **Frequency Sensitivity**: Larger animals may have lower-frequency hearing sensitivity due to the larger structures of their ear canal and eardrum. In contrast, smaller animals may have greater sensitivity to higher frequencies. This is why small animals like bats or rodents can hear high-pitched sounds used for echolocation, while larger animals like elephants are more sensitive to low-frequency sounds, which travel farther.

# 2. Middle Ear Mechanics:

* The size and mechanics of the **middle ear**, particularly the ossicles (small bones that transmit sound vibrations), also scale with body size. In larger animals, the ossicles may be larger and capable of transmitting lower-frequency sounds more effectively, while in smaller animals, they may be optimized for higher-frequency sounds.

# 3. Cochlear Structure:

* The **cochlea**, the spiral-shaped organ in the inner ear responsible for converting sound vibrations into electrical signals, scales differently in terms of its **length** and **coiling**. In larger animals, the cochlea might be longer, which could allow for a better separation of different frequencies, potentially making the animal more sensitive to low frequencies.
* Smaller animals may have a more compact cochlea that is better suited for detecting higher frequencies, which are important for communication in some small animals (e.g., bats, rodents).

# 4. Sound Processing:

* The **speed of neural processing** in the auditory pathway (from the ear to the brain) may also scale with body size. Larger animals might process sound signals more slowly due to longer neural pathways, which can affect how they perceive sounds, especially rapid changes in frequency or direction.

# 5. Evolutionary Adaptations:

* Animals have evolved to optimize their hearing based on their environment and body size. For example:
   * **Elephants**, being large, are adapted to hearing **low-frequency sounds** (infrasound) that can travel long distances, which is useful for communication over large areas.
   * **Bats** and **mice**, being small, have evolved to hear **high-frequency sounds**, such as those used for echolocation and predator detection.

# 6. Behavioral and Ecological Effects:

* The scaling of hearing may affect an animal's behavior and ecology. For instance, **predatory animals** may rely on low-frequency sounds to detect prey or navigate their environment, while **prey species** may have adapted to detect high-frequency sounds to hear predators approaching.",2025-03-29 22:54:27,0,ProgressiveOverlorde,science

Abstract

To test the moral critique of patriotism, we explored patriots’ moral values and choices. Study 1 (N = 1,062) examined the links between three types of patriotism – conventional patriotism, glorification of the nation, and constructive patriotism – and moral values. Glorification was positively linked with binding values, but negatively with fairness. Conventional patriotism was positively linked with harm, loyalty, and authority and constructive patriotism with harm, fairness, and loyalty. Study 2 (N = 1,041) examined the links between patriotism and moral decisions. We presented participants with political dilemmas that required choosing one moral value over another. Glorification was linked with choosing binding over individualizing values. Conventional patriotism was linked with choosing authority over individualizing values and individualizing values over loyalty.

From the linked article:

New study demonstrates the problem with uncritical patriotism

New research published in Self & Identity suggests that not all forms of patriotism carry the same moral implications. Those who express uncritical, nationalistic forms of love for country often prioritize group loyalty and authority over fairness and harm prevention.

The results revealed distinct moral profiles across patriotism types. Glorification showed positive associations with authority and purity values but negative relationships with harm prevention and fairness. Interestingly, its connection to loyalty was only marginally significant. This suggests that those who glorify their nation tend to prioritize obedience to national symbols and traditional purity values while being less concerned with preventing harm or ensuring fairness.",2025-04-06 11:44:58,13,mvea,science

Summary

The use of fermented foods and drinks by humans is so widespread as to be considered ubiquitous, with their use largely linked to dietary benefits and social bonding123. The discovery of a molecular adaptation in an alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme that greatly increased ethanol metabolism in the common ancestor of African apes suggests that the incorporation of fermented fruit in the human diet has ancient origins4. However, little is known about the inclusion of ethanolic foods in the diet of nonhuman great apes. Here, we document for the first time the repeated ingestion and sharing of naturally fermented African breadfruit (Treculia africana) with confirmed ethanol (alcohol), by wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) in Cantanhez National Park, Guinea-Bissau. Widespread plant food sharing in great apes and the recent confirmation of ethanol presence in diverse fruit species5 suggest the sharing, and dietary incorporation, of ethanol-containing foods is extensive and may have played a long-standing role in hominoid societies.

From the linked article: 

Wild chimpanzees filmed by scientists bonding over alcoholic fruit

Footage of apes consuming fermented breadfruit leads researchers to ask if it may shed light on origins of human feasting

Humans have gathered to feast and enjoy a tipple together for thousands of years, but research suggests chimpanzees may also bond over a boozy treat.

Wild chimpanzees in west Africa have been observed sharing fruit containing alcohol – not in quantities to get roaring drunk but, possibly, enough for a fuzzy beer buzz feeling.

The researchers, led by scientists from the University of Exeter in the UK, caught chimpanzees on film sharing fermented African breadfruit in Guinea-Bissau’s Cantanhez national park.

“For humans, we know that drinking alcohol leads to a release of dopamine and endorphins, and resulting feelings of happiness and relaxation,” said Anna Bowland, from the Centre for Ecology and Conservation at Exeter’s Penryn campus in Cornwall.

“We also know that sharing alcohol, including through traditions such as feasting, helps to form and strengthen social bonds.

“Now we know that wild chimpanzees are eating and sharing ethanolic fruits, the question is: could they be getting similar benefits?”

Using motion-activated cameras, the researchers filmed chimpanzees sharing the large, dense and fibrous fermented fruit on 10 occasions. The fruit shared was tested for alcohol content. The highest level found was the equivalent of 0.61% alcohol by volume (ABV).",2025-04-21 15:59:47,28,mvea,science

The mental health outcomes studied were depression and anxiety disorders over an average of 11 years.

1.    Adults <60: Higher intake of SSBs and ASBs (>1 serving/day) was associated with a higher risk of depression (SSBs: 14% increase, ASBs: 23% increase). Consumption of fruit juices and coffee was linked to a lower risk of depression (fruit juices: 19% decrease, coffee: 12% decrease). Coffee also reduced the risk of anxiety.

2.    Adults 60 and over: There was no clear link between SSBs/ASBs and mental health. Higher intake of fruit juices and coffee was associated with lower risks of both depression and anxiety.

3.    Beverage substitution: For adults <60, replacing SSBs with fruit juices or coffee reduced depression and anxiety risks. For older adults, replacing milk with fruit juices or coffee was associated with lower risks of both conditions.

https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fapl0001278

Abstract 

Employees, especially in the service sector, often work long hours exposed to background music that they have little control over because it is usually selected to enhance customer experience. How does this affect employees’ daily work experience? This research focuses on how a misfit between the type of music employees need and the background music played in their workplace impacts their psychological states and behaviors. Integrating stimulus–organism–response theory with the research on self-regulation of attention in the workplace, we theorize that workplace music misfit can lower employees’ positive affect and increase cognitive depletion, further impacting their organizationally directed citizenship and counterproductive work behaviors. We also theorize that these adverse effects of workplace music misfit are stronger for employees who have lower stimulus screening ability. The test of our hypotheses across two studies—an online experimental study and a 3-week experience sampling methodology field study—broadly supported our theory. Our research offers a novel and dynamic account of workplace background music and its effects on employees’ psychological states and workplace behavior.

‘Ugh, not that song!’ Background music impacts employees

Performance suffers when music is a misfit for worker needs

Have you ever gone to a store or a restaurant where the music was so annoying that you walked right out? Now imagine what it must be like for the employees.

In a new study, researchers found that when background music at a workplace is out of sync with what workers need to do their jobs, it can affect their energy, mood – and even performance.

“Music that doesn’t fit what an employee needs to feel energized, manage emotions, and focus on task can have a real negative impact,” said Kathleen Keeler, co-lead author of the study and assistant professor of management and human resources at The Ohio State University’s Fisher College of Business.

“We found that a music misfit can lead employees to feel more fatigued, have trouble focusing, and not really enjoy being at work. And that in turns prompts them to engage in behaviors that can harm the organization.”

The problem is worse for people who have difficulty screening out background noise from their environment, the study found.

It is an understudied issue, Keeler said.  About 13.5 million people work in occupations where background music is common. But the music is often chosen with only customers in mind.

“It is a mistake for managers to assume that music doesn’t affect employees,” Keeler said.",2025-04-08 12:06:17,38,mvea,science

First hormone-free male birth control pill clears another milestone

While the FDA has approved over 20 different categories of contraceptives, only two are available for men to prevent pregnancy in their partners — condoms and vasectomies. 25% of women who use contraception use an oral birth control pill, but there are no equivalent methods currently available for men. 

Research from the University of Minnesota College of Pharmacy, published in Communications Medicine, laid the groundwork for the first hormone-free male birth control pill to enter clinical trials. 

The new drug, called YCT-529, is a first-in-class, hormone-free and orally administered male contraceptive. Developed in collaboration with Columbia University in New York and YourChoice Therapeutics, YCT-529 works as a contraceptive by stopping the production of sperm.

The research found:

- In male mice, the drug caused infertility and was 99% effective in preventing pregnancies within four weeks of use.

- In male non-human primates, the drug lowered sperm counts within two weeks of starting the drug.

- Both mice and non-human primates fully regained fertility after stopping the drug. Mice regained fertility within six weeks, and non-human primates fully recovered their sperm count in 10-15 weeks.

- No side effects from the drug were detected in either group.",2025-03-28 10:03:28,67,mvea,science

Side effects on female oral contraceptives, on the other hand, are weighed against pregnancy itself so there's more ""room"" for side effects to exist without reaching a tipping point into actual harm when compared to what they're intended to treat.",2025-03-28 11:43:05,84,incubusfox,science

Now from what research tells me, its 500 times more selective in targeting RARα, over RARβ, and RARγ, which means it still targets RARβ and RARγ, but even its targeting of RARα means there are some really bad side effects, Now RARα is simple, it causes short term reversible infertility, which is the goal, but it can harm bone health, act as a immune suppresent, as well as a possible cognitive decline, which isnt Too bad, RARβ is less reasearched, but if suppressed over a longer time can causer nerver damage, as well as increasing tumour risks, which is bad, RARγ isnt that bad comparatively speaking, but severe dryskin, bone and joint issues, and surface wounds healing worse.  
However, if long term use don't have have any of the side effects, and if it does, it's temporary, then this could be a good male contraceptative.  
There are female equivelants, with much of the same risks PPARγ inhibitors, ALDH1A inhibitors, CatSper blockers, and LXR inhibitors, and of them only CatSper blockers doesnt appear to have terrible side effects, and even that is subjective, cause it works by affecting calcium, which increases heart risks, but thats not the bad part, the bad part is that it could make menstrual cramps worse, and i bet some of you just felt a phantom pain just not from just imagining it.

Second, It’s based on fMRI, which according to experts I work with, are not as informative or clear as we are led to believe, and on self-report. All of that is suspect because It’s not clear whether the participants knew what they were testing, but if they did know, that could skew everything. And unless they found a way to blind participants to what they were consuming - like administering it with an NG tube - almost everyone can tell the difference between sugar and an artificial sweetener, and of course, no sweetener.

And I have no way of knowing if their P values were accurate or cooked, and if those values are actually significant.

It is not a surprise to us that drinking sucralose makes you hungrier than drinking sugar, because sugar has calories in it.  And the evidence strongly points to the hunger being caused by drinking sucralose water to... The increase in hunger caused by drinking water.

This study proposes that it could lead to changes in how the brain processes a sweet taste, but the thing is, this hypothesis has been proposed for decades, and the body of evidence so far is strongly against the hypothesis. Instead, we've learned that the body does not accept sweetness alone to be satiating.

Abstract

Sucralose, a widely used non-caloric sweetener, provides sweet taste without calories. Some studies suggest that non-caloric sweeteners stimulate appetite, possibly owing to the delivery of a sweet taste without the post-ingestive metabolic signals that normally communicate with the hypothalamus to suppress hunger. In a randomized crossover trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02945475), 75 young adults (healthy weight, overweight or with obesity) consumed a drink containing sucralose, sweetness-matched sucrose or water. We show that acute consumption of sucralose versus sucrose stimulates hypothalamic blood flow (P < 0.018) and greater hunger responses (P < 0.001). Sucralose versus water also increases hypothalamic blood flow (P < 0.019) but produces no difference in hunger ratings. Sucrose, but not sucralose, increases peripheral glucose levels, which are associated with reductions in medial hypothalamic blood flow (P < 0.007). Sucralose, compared to sucrose and water, results in increased functional connections between the hypothalamus and brain regions involved in motivation and somatosensory processing. These findings suggest that non-caloric sweeteners could affect key mechanisms in the hypothalamus responsible for appetite regulation.

From the linked article: 

Calorie-free sweeteners can disrupt the brain’s appetite signals

A study from the Keck School of Medicine of USC found that a common sugar substitute alters brain activity related to hunger and increases appetite, especially in people with obesity.

Compared to sugar, consuming sucralose—a widely used sugar substitute—increases activity in the hypothalamus, a brain region that regulates appetite and body weight, according to a new USC study. Sucralose also changes how the hypothalamus communicates with other brain regions, including those involved in motivation. The study was just published in the journal Nature Metabolism.

About 40% of Americans regularly consume sugar substitutes, usually as a way to reduce calories or sugar intake. “But are these substances actually helpful for regulating body weight? What happens in the body and brain when we consume then, and do the effects differ from one person to the next?” said the study’s corresponding author, Kathleen Alanna Page, MD, director of the USC Diabetes and Obesity Research Institute and co-chief of the Division of Endocrinology and Diabetes at the Keck School of Medicine of USC.

Page and her colleagues designed a randomized experiment to test how sucralose changes brain activity, hormone levels and hunger. Earlier research—mostly done with animal models and large population studies—has hinted at a link between calorie-free sweeteners and obesity, but has not directly shown how these substances affect hunger in humans. 

With funding from the National Institutes of Health, the researchers tested how 75 participants responded after consuming water, a drink sweetened with sucralose or a drink sweetened with regular sugar. They collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain scans, blood samples and hunger ratings before and after participants consumed the drink. Sucralose increased hunger and activity in the hypothalamus, especially in people with obesity. It also changed the way the hypothalamus communicated with other brain regions. Unlike sugar, sucralose did not increase blood levels of certain hormones that create a feeling of fullness.

The findings show how sucralose confuses the brain by providing a sweet taste without the expected caloric energy, said Page, who is also an associate professor of medicine at the Keck School of Medicine.

mk053t7,1jkt3wk,reddit,"Many studies of artificial sweeteners in humans are flawed because they’re conducted in people that have been exposed to artificial sweeteners their whole lives. If sweeteners were to have an effect on the brain’s ability to learn an appropriate metabolic response, it would be greatest in those who’d never had them before.

This is one potential reason why studies in children and animals tend to reveal negative effects of sweetener consumption, while not so much in adults.

I imagine that your car’s dash display (sweet taste) accurately reflects the fuel level (calories). What if, one day, the display started overestimating how much fuel you have left? You might run into an issue once or twice, but then you would learn that it overestimates. But what if it starts to also underestimate, and be accurate sometimes (whenever you eat something without artificial sweeteners)? You would slowly stop trusting the display and compensate by filling up the tank more often or rely on other ways to gauge fuel levels.

Then, some scientists want to see if a faulty display can impact how often you fill up the tank (weight gain). Should they recruit those who have been driving with faulty displays for a while, or those who haven’t?

Please consider this before you dig up old studies that show how artificial sweeteners have no effect. By the time the participants enrolled in the study, the damage might have already been done.",2025-03-27 12:54:42,0,Ide_kae,science

Abstract

Growing evidence exists about the importance of dark personality traits – narcissism, psychopathy and Machiavellianism – in political leaders, broadly leading to heightened political aggressiveness and partisan conflict. Building on this expanding research agenda, we study the possible association between dark personality in politicians and deepened affective polarization – that is, increased affective distance between partisan groups coupled with stronger dislike for out-parties – in the public. We do so by linking a large-scale expert survey (NEGex) and a collection of post-election surveys (CSES), including information for more than 90 leading candidates having competed in 40 elections worldwide. Our results show that the dark personality of top politicians can be associated with upticks in affective polarization in the public – but only when it comes to the personality of in-party candidates (that is, a candidate from voters’ preferred party), and only for high levels of ideological proximity between the candidate and the voter.

From the linked article: 

Dark Personality Traits in Politicians Fuel Political Polarization

Summary: New research reveals that politicians with narcissistic, psychopathic, or Machiavellian traits significantly increase affective polarization among voters. When citizens identify ideologically with such leaders, they become more hostile toward political opponents.

This polarization is driven not by opposing politicians but by the actions and rhetoric of the leaders they support. The findings suggest that emotionally manipulative leadership poses a threat to democratic norms and social cohesion.

The researchers linked the personality profiles of over 90 prominent politicians worldwide with voter attitudes in 40 national elections. The results reveal striking patterns.

Politicians who score high on the so-called Dark Triad – narcissism (excessive self-focus), psychopathy (emotional coldness and lack of empathy), and Machiavellianism (a tendency toward manipulation and deception) – are associated with greater hostility toward political opponents among their followers.

The study included leaders such as Donald Trump, Jair Bolsonaro, Emmanuel Macron, Marine Le Pen, Angela Merkel, Theresa May, Jeremy Corbyn, Boris Johnson, Viktor Orbán, Narendra Modi, Silvio Berlusconi, Shinzo Abe, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and many others. Dutch politicians such as Mark Rutte and Geert Wilders were also part of the analysis.",2025-04-16 01:08:45,14,mvea,science

mnwmty2,1k2t9n7,reddit,"The room is crowded and noisy. There are conversations all around, and the residual smell of popcorn and beer hangs in the air. Yet two women meeting for the first time can judge within minutes whether they have potential to be friends – guided as much by smell as any other sense, according to new Cornell psychology research.

“People take a lot in when they’re meeting face to face. But scent, which people are registering at some level, though probably not consciously, forecasts whether you end up liking this person,” said Vivian Zayas ’94, professor of psychology in the College of Arts and Sciences (A&S). “It’s amazing, our attunement to other people, even without being consciously aware of how in tune we are.”

In a study of heterosexual women, Zayas and first author Jessica Gaby, Ph.D. ’17, found that personal, idiosyncratic preferences based on a person’s everyday scent, captured on a T-shirt, predicted how much women liked their interaction partner following four-minute chats across a table in a crowded room. These face-to-face conversations, in turn, influenced how participants later judged the T-shirt scent alone.

The study also found that preferences based on scent – by sniffing a person’s T-shirt – predicted how much participants liked that same person after viewing that person’s portrait for just 100 milliseconds.

“If you think you might be friends with someone you haven’t met based on a tenth-of-a-second exposure to their photograph, you are also more likely to judge them as a potential friend based on the scent of their T-shirt,” Zayas said.

I remember in my final year of undergrad in ~2017, the supervisor of the lab I was volunteering in gave a lecture that basically was making an argument for recognising depression as a neuro-inflammatory disease rather than a serotonin deficiency, and to pivot therapies into ones that show anti-inflammatory effects. He gave several reasons based on previously published papers across the literature (and if asked I can maybe stretch my mind back to recall some), but one finding I always found fascinating was that many already on-the-shelf anti-depressants were already showing modest anti-inflammatory effects. Though they had been designed with the serotonin theory in mind, he posited that maybe they had been selected for through the processes of clinical trials ultimately for their anti-inflammatory properties rather than their serotonin properties, and that future work should be put into researching therapies with more profound anti-inflammatory effects. The lab I was in was more pre-clinical than clinical based, that said, and I've completely pivoted my research focus at least 2-3 times since then, but it's interesting to be reminded of that work, and see where the field has come since then.",2025-04-12 11:11:24,589,FlyByTieDye,science

Abstract

Recent evidence from clinical and animal studies with anti-inflammatory agents in depression is conflicting. One possible reason is the heterogeneity of baseline inflammation levels. Since older adults are generally associated with chronic low-grade inflammation and depression is one of the most common mental disorders in this population, this meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the therapeutic and preventative effects of anti-inflammatory interventions for depression among older adults. PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and PsycINFO were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to November 18, 2024. The primary outcomes were mean change scores of depression scores and incidences of depression after treatment. Pooled standard mean differences (SMDs) and odds ratios (ORs) including 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. Of 3116 screened articles, 31 RCTs met the inclusion criteria, with 25 studies investigating efficacy and 7 studies investigating the incidence following anti-inflammatory treatment. Anti-inflammatory interventions were statistically significantly more effective than placebo in reducing depressive scores for older adults with depression (SMD = −0.57, 95% CI = −0.98 to −0.15, p = 0.008). Sub-group analyses supported the use of omega-3 fatty acids (SMD = −0.14, 95% CI = −0.27 to −0.02, p = 0.03) and botanical drug or dietary intervention (SMD = −0.86, 95% CI = −1.58 to −0.13, p = 0.02) among older participants. While limited by substantial heterogeneity among included studies, these results reveal the moderate beneficial effects of anti-inflammatory interventions for the treatment and prevention of depression among older adults. Future high-quality RCTs are warranted to determine which anti-inflammatory interventions are most preferential for older patients with depression.

From the linked article:

Does Inflammation Lead to Depression?

Research finds anti-inflammatory interventions may help with depression.

KEY POINTS

Evidence suggests that inflammation in the brain may be trigger for depression.

Researchers are testing whether anti-inflammatory interventions can help to prevent or treat depression.

Nutritional research has identified a variety of foods known to reduce inflammation in the body.

To further investigate this, health researchers have been testing anti-inflammatory interventions to treat depression. A systematic review published this month in the journal Nature Translational Psychology pulled together data from 31 randomized controlled trials to assess whether anti-inflammatory treatments helped reduce depressive scores among older adults. The researchers focused on older adults because chronic inflammation is a hallmark of the aging process.

They found that anti-inflammatory interventions—including omega-3 fatty acids, herbal medicines, and dietary interventions—were more effective than placebo in reducing depressive scores for older adults with depression. Participants using anti-inflammatory interventions showed similar improvements to those taking anti-depressants.",2025-04-12 10:35:20,14,mvea,science

mmpp1zt,1jxecwm,reddit,"What came first, the depression or the inflammation?

I have questions. I don't think it's the reduction in inflammation that causes the reduction in depression. I think that's a confounded variable/result.

The changes in diet and drugs caused a reduction in depressive symptoms. We can't prove those things caused a reduction in inflammation. We can only take a guess based on the way we expect them to work in the body.

Why did the NSAIDs not work? I don't believe in the authors' claim that it's because the older population didn't have severe depressive symptoms. ""Intriguingly, we find beneficial effects of omega-3 FA and botanical drug or dietary intervention, but not NSAIDs and statins, among old population. However, young adult MDD patients may benefit from a broader spectrum of anti-inflammatory agents, including NSAIDs, statins, cytokine inhibitors, etc \[[39](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-025-03317-3#ref-CR39), [40](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-025-03317-3#ref-CR40)\]. This distinction might be partially attributed to the severity of depression. The inflammatory activity may be particularly elevated in these severe MDD patients \[[73](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-025-03317-3#ref-CR73)\], making them benefits more from the classic anti-inflammatory agents.""

I think it's because of confounding variables. If you are depressed, it's harder to maintain a good diet. Outsourcing that care, asking someone else to prepare the food for you so you can have a break, can reduce your depressive symptoms because it is one less thing for you to worry about.

First of all, the randomised controlled experiments and large data sets shows that the findings from the research can be generalised. It is impressive for me to see how modern researchers challenge long-held beliefs and push us to consider alternative causes and treatments. The idea that whatever we eat can have a direct impact on our mood, shows that our lifestyle choices can intersect with mental health, a topic often overlooked in traditional medical conversations.

But this research also raises one critical question for me: Why has the inflammation-depression link taken so long to enter mainstream thinking? And can we say that pharmaceutical interests have slowed down this shift? And I think that it is also important to remember that while inflammation may contribute to depression, it’s likely just one piece of a much more complex puzzle.

Changing implicit stereotypes helps men see themselves as more caring

Men who were trained to associate communal traits with their own gender subsequently identified more with these traits themselves, according to new research published in Self & Identity.

Caring, empathy, and social connection—collectively referred to as “communion”—are values that enhance well-being and support healthy societies. However, research shows that men consistently identify less with these communal traits than women do, a gender gap that persists despite growing societal emphasis on equality. This pattern raises concerns not only for men’s personal fulfillment but also for broader goals like shared caregiving and gender-balanced workplaces.

This research provides evidence that men’s implicit self-concept can be shaped by modifying gender stereotypes, with important implications for interventions aimed at promoting gender equity and broader identification with communal values.",2025-04-17 22:44:54,18,mvea,science

From the linked article: 

People with psychopathic personality traits are often thought to be destined for antisocial and criminal behavior. But new research published in the Journal of Criminal Justice challenges this view. The study found that certain environmental factors—like higher socioeconomic status and strong parental monitoring—can reduce the likelihood that people high in psychopathic traits will engage in criminal activity.

Importantly, the researchers found that several environmental factors influenced how psychopathic traits translated into criminal behavior. Socioeconomic status stood out as a particularly consistent protective factor. Across all facets of psychopathy, individuals from higher-status families were less likely to commit future crimes, even if they scored high on psychopathy measures.

In contrast, individuals from lower-status backgrounds were more likely to commit crimes when they had high levels of callousness or egocentricity. These results support the idea that access to resources and social stability may reduce the expression of harmful behaviors in individuals with risky personality traits.

Parental monitoring also showed a protective effect, especially in relation to overall psychopathy scores. Participants whose parents kept track of their whereabouts, asked questions, and encouraged open communication were less likely to commit crimes, even if they scored high in psychopathy. The effect of parental monitoring was strongest for the total psychopathy score, rather than for individual traits. This suggests that consistent supervision may help blunt the impact of a broad psychopathic personality pattern.",2025-04-20 10:06:14,21,mvea,science

Emphasis mine because I think that this is likely related more to the relatively arbitrary definitions of criminality in our legal system than to the actual likelihood of committing acts that do not comport with generally accepted ideas of morality.  The fact is that there are perfectly legal things only wealthy people can do which have *very* close analogues accessible to non-wealthy people which *are* classified as criminal.  Tax avoidance versus tax fraud, for instance.  It like powder cocaine versus crack (okay technically both are illegal but one is like orders of magnitude more severely punished despite being the same thing aside from price).  You get the idea.

Basically I'm saying that the methodology of using ""criminality"" as a stand-in for ""immorality"" is fundamentally flawed if one of the factors you're considering is socioeconomic status because of the way that legal systems show deference to those of a higher status.",2025-04-20 19:36:15,1,T_Weezy,science

It seems plausible that those already dealing with mental health struggles might interpret more everyday situations as discriminatory, even if no clear intent is present. This could explain part of the correlation.

Brain-harming chemicals released from mattresses while children sleep, study says

Babies’ and children’s mattresses and bedding emit toxic chemicals and flame retardants associated with developmental and hormonal disorders, according to two new studies.

“We measured chemicals in the air of 25 children’s bedrooms between the ages of 6 months and 4 years and found worrisome levels of more than two dozen phthalates, flame retardants and UV filters,” said senior study author Miriam Diamond, a professor in the Earth Sciences Department at the University of Toronto.

The highest levels of the chemicals were found near the children’s beds, according to the study published Tuesday in the journal Environmental Science & Technology.

To check why, a companion study by Diamond’s team tested 16 new children’s mattresses and found those to be a key source of the exposure. Then, using a simulation, the team found that the warmth and weight of the sleeping child could increase the off-gassing of the toxicants.

“They found that even something as simple as a child’s body heat and weight on a mattress can increase the release of toxic chemicals into the air they breathe while sleeping – a factor that current safety standards don’t consider,” said Jane Houlihan, research director for Healthy Babies, Bright Futures, an alliance of nonprofits, scientists and donors dedicated to reducing babies’ exposures to neurotoxic chemicals.

mo8b1qd,1k49g7l,reddit,"A research team from Yonsei University has developed an AI model that screens for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) using retinal fundus photographs -- images of the back of the eye -- reporting a top diagnostic accuracy of 96.9 percent in internal testing.

The study, published last month in npj Digital Medicine, analyzed 1,108 retinal images from 646 children and adolescents under age 19. Participants included 323 patients diagnosed with ADHD at two Korean hospitals -- Severance Hospital and Eunpyeong St. Mary’s Hospital -- and 323 age- and sex-matched individuals without the disorder.

  
The Yonsei team, led by Professors Cheon Keun-ah and Choi Hang-nyoung from the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Professor Park Yu-rang from the Department of Biomedical Systems Informatics, used a machine learning tool called AutoMorph to extract detailed measurements from the eye images. 

They trained four types of AI models to differentiate ADHD from typical development. The top-performing model reached an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.969—a standard measure of diagnostic accuracy where 1.0 represents perfect classification. The model also showed over 91 percent sensitivity (ability to detect ADHD) and specificity (ability to rule it out).

The 6 Sly Ways of the Gaslighter

A new review illuminates the causes and consequences of gaslighting.

KEY POINTS

•	⁠Gaslighting has received popular attention, but relatively little empirical research.

•	⁠A new paper traces the history of gaslighting and compares relevant theoretical perspectives.

•	⁠It all boils down to six basic tactics that allow gaslighters to have their power over their victims.


Most recently, gaslighting has taken on a social and cultural interpretation in which the behavior is seen as an attempt to quash resistance in institutions ranging from “medical institutions, workplaces, mass media, and politics.” However, writers who prefer to reserve the term for interpersonal relationships suggest that there be, instead, “gaslighting-adjacent” terms such as “cultural gaslighting.”

This insightful and comprehensive analysis of the attempts within various disciplines to provide an understanding of gaslighting may leave you wondering whether anyone will ever agree on what the phenomenon is or why it exists. You’ll be glad to know, then, that the U. Sydney team did settle on six basic concepts that help to organize the existing literature and provide a framework for future work. It is these six qualities, they conclude, that constitute gaslighting:



1.	⁠Manipulation of reality: These tactics include lying, questioning perceptions, thoughts, reactions, or memories, or manipulating the environment to create confusion.
2.	⁠Denial: Refusing to acknowledge facts, even when there is evidence to the contrary, dismissing, and minimizing; this shifts responsibility from perpetrator to victim.
3.	⁠Inconsistency of behavior: Keeping the target “off kilter” by making them unsure of what to expect… “lies or truth, or love and abuse.”
4.	⁠Isolation: Coercing the victim to spend less time with family and friends, therefore cutting off other sources of support and views of reality.
5.	⁠Coercion: Making the target feel that it’s necessary to come to a resolution to “restore peace and stability within the relationship.” The abuse plays on the target’s fear of being left or abandoned.
6.	⁠Creating self-doubt: For gaslighting to work, the victim must feel put off guard enough to wonder about their self-worth, if not having their self-worth crumble completely.",2025-03-31 12:07:58,81,mvea,science

Gas Light is a 1938 thriller play, set in 1880s London, written by the British novelist and playwright Patrick Hamilton. Hamilton’s play is a dark tale of a marriage based on deceit and trickery, and a husband committed to driving his wife insane in order to steal from her.

mkd16xh,1jmnqdu,reddit,"From the press release:

The reuse of human urine would allow for the production of sustainable fertilizers for urban agriculture, with significant environmental benefits. This is the conclusion of a study conducted by the ICTA-UAB, which evaluates the environmental impact of nitrogen recovery from the yellow waters of buildings. In addition to promoting sustainable agriculture, it would reduce CO2 emissions and water consumption.



The global demand for fertilizers in agriculture is growing every day, making it necessary to reduce dependence on non-renewable sources. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the global demand for nitrogen as a fertilizer grows annually by 1%, which amounts to an increase of 1.074 million tons each year.





The production of these fertilizers relies heavily on non-renewable energy sources such as natural gas, oil, and coal, representing significant energy consumption and CO2 emissions.





This new study, led by the Sostenipra group of ICTA-UAB in collaboration with the GENOCOV group of the Department of Chemical, Biological, and Environmental Engineering, presents human urine nutrient recovery as a solution to transforming urban agriculture. The article, published in the scientific journal Resources, Conservation and Recycling, explains that the use of urine allows exploiting local resources and minimizes the use of external inputs, contributing to the sustainability of the agricultural process. Furthermore, it reduces dependence on limited resources and supports a more environmentally responsible cycle.

https://www.nature.com/articles/s44184-025-00123-z

Abstract

The burgeoning field of the microbiome–gut–brain axis has inspired research into how the gut microbiome can affect human emotion. Probiotics offer ways to investigate microbial-based interventions but results have been mixed, with more evidence of beneficial effects in clinically depressed patients. Using a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled design in 88 healthy volunteers, we conduct a comprehensive study into effects of a multispecies probiotic on emotion regulation and mood through questionnaires, emotional processing tests and daily reports. We find clear evidence that probiotics reduce negative mood, starting after two weeks, based on daily monitoring, but few other changes. Our findings reconcile inconsistencies of previous studies, revealing that commonly used pre- versus post-intervention assessments cannot reliably detect probiotic-induced changes in healthy subjects’ emotional state. We conclude that probiotics can benefit mental health in the general population and identify traits of individuals who derive greatest benefit, allowing future targeting of at-risk individuals.

From the linked article: 

Probiotics May Improve Mood Via Gut–Brain Axis

Probiotics are “good” bacteria in the form of drinks or tablets that you can buy in the supermarket and are also found in foods like yogurts, fermented cheese and sauerkraut. There is growing interest in the possibility that probiotics improve not only gut health but also mental health. “The gut–brain connection provides various routes through which bacteria in the gut can influence how we feel and behave, including via the vagus nerve, immune system and hormones”, says Johnson.

While animal studies have previously found promising effects of probiotics on the brain and behaviour, human studies have yielded inconsistent results. Johnson and Steenbergen therefore used a combination of methods to capture how probiotics might influence the ability to regulate our emotions and affect our moods. These included psychological questionnaires, daily mood reports and computer tasks testing how people process emotions. The study was conducted in young, healthy adults who took a probiotic (containing bacteria such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium) daily for a month.

This is the first study to use daily mood reports to assess the effects of probiotics. It clearly shows that probiotics can reduce negative feelings compared to a placebo. This could mean a reduction in feelings such as anxiety, stress, fatigue or depressive tendencies. ‘It is striking that by simply asking participants how they were feeling each day, we could detect the beneficial effects of probiotics on mood’, says Steenbergen. ‘In contrast, the standard psychological questionnaires that are common in this field were not sensitive enough to pick up these changes.’

The researchers found that it took about two weeks for the probiotics to improve negative feelings. It takes about the same amount of time for antidepressants to work, but whereas antidepressants tend to reduce both negative and positive mood, the results showed that the probiotics only reduced negative mood. This could be a possible benefit, although the researchers stress that probiotics should not be considered a substitute for antidepressants.",2025-04-14 12:15:04,12,mvea,science

mmf9tpw,1jw3ukb,reddit,"From the [study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2832469): Infection prevention remains a cornerstone of patient safety, requiring evidence-based strategies to guide clinical practices. One in 10 adult inpatients in Australian public hospitals acquire a health care–associated infection (HAI)1 resulting in more than 165 000 cases in Australia annually and contributes to approximately 7500 deaths each year.2 Despite the increased morbidity and mortality risks associated with HAIs, robust evidence supporting cost-effective infection prevention interventions is limited.

Environmental cleaning plays a critical role in infection prevention programs, albeit sometimes overlooked. Pathogens can survive on clinical surfaces for extended periods, creating reservoirs that facilitate transmission to patients.3 The nexus between environmental contamination and pathogen transmission in health care facilities is now well established,4-6 emphasizing the need for effective cleaning strategies.

The Researching Effective Approaches to Cleaning in Hospitals (REACH) trial demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of an environmental cleaning bundle focused on patient rooms.7 However, this study did not focus on the cleaning of shared medical equipment, which are used by multiple patients and should be decontaminated between use. Building on this foundation, the recent Cleaning and Enhanced Disinfection (CLEEN) study, conducted in 2023, was the first cluster randomized trial to assess the effect of improved cleaning and disinfection of shared medical equipment on HAI point prevalence.8 The CLEEN study evaluated a multimodal cleaning bundle that included additional dedicated cleaning hours, ongoing education, audit, and feedback mechanisms. The bundle was trialed in 10 wards of an Australian hospital using a cluster randomized, stepped-wedge design over 36 weeks. The results indicated that enhanced cleaning and disinfection protocols significantly reduced HAIs, underlining the importance for infection prevention.9 Moreover, the study highlighted the role of staff training, auditing, and feedback in maintaining high standards of cleanliness, thereby contributing to the overall success of infection prevention strategies in health care settings.

We conducted a within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis of the CLEEN study intervention, designed to reduce HAIs. Our aim is to provide health care decision-makers with robust evidence from an economic perspective. There is a paucity of cost-effectiveness evaluations for environmental cleaning interventions. Economic evaluations allow the clinical benefits and cost resources necessary to undertake treatments to be quantified—providing evidence supporting decisions about funding, reimbursement and investment in clinical services. Such evidence is of great value as health care decision-makers are tasked with balancing increased demand for services with a finite budget, in a time when hospital safety and quality is constantly in the spotlight.",2025-04-10 17:41:13,29,chrisdh79,science

mmjvwal,1jw3ukb,reddit,"Imagine not being forced to turn over (door to door) a bloody mess of an OR room in 20 minutes including cleaning/mopping, a change of equipment and bed, opening new supplies, and rolling the patient back because patient satisfaction is overwhelmingly more important to any kind of safety. Being hungry or thirsty for a couple of hours is just too much for some people. Opening 10 trays of instruments in a couple of minutes is totally safe, and my scrub can definitely check each instrument to make sure they're not contaminated by the time we're in the room (hint: they can't always, even if there are 2 of them... I had to break down a whole neuro set-up just yesterday, with the patient in the room sleeping, because 1 dirty instrument was found too late, and there were 2 scrubs, which is not typical).

Not being forced to turn over trays of cannulated, very sharp, tiny, and/or ridged instruments as quickly as processing can because the hospital refuses to buy any more sets and the doctor booked more cases than you have sets available... each set takes a minimum of 4 hours to turn over.

I wish they'd give us more time to clean things properly, but... money talks, cleaning is a waste of money, extra equipment isn't needed, and a lot of patients just don't have any patience.

I understand that the article spoke briefly about other areas to clean... but I think sterile/substerile areas are just as important and often overlooked because people can't access these areas as easily as a random wheelchair or commode in the hallway.",2025-04-11 12:28:49,9,SheSends,science

If you don’t support CRT you’re not going to know all its little terms and definitions. The same way if you weren’t Muslim you wouldn’t know as many Islamic tenants. This study implies causation where there is correlation. You could logically say that the more people learn about Islam the more they support it. It’s the other way around. Those who support Islam know more about it.

I think you could plug in almost any ideology and come to this exact conclusion.

Edit: To those pointing out that this was a before and after study - the “after” study shows that “racial knowledge” correlated with CRT support. Ie. Those that didn’t “gain” any “racial knowledge” didn’t support as much as people who “gained” that knowledge. That’s my point. Those that support CRT study it and memorize it. Those that don’t score lower on the “knowledge” scale. The more significant thing you could conclude is that when you teach people an ideology, some people will learn more and support it and some won’t. Once again, that’s anything.

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471015325000406

Abstract

There is a continued need to identify the prevalence and sociodemographic correlates of eating disorders, particularly among the under-researched group of boys and men, to inform prevention and intervention efforts. Data from The Study of Boys and Men, a sample of 1553 boys and men aged between 15 and 35 years in Canada and the United States, were analyzed in 2024. Probable eating disorder diagnoses were identified using a previously established algorithm based on current diagnostic criteria. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine the sociodemographic correlates of meeting the criteria for any probable eating disorder diagnosis. The prevalence of meeting the criteria for any probable eating disorder diagnosis was 21.3 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 18.7–24.1), while meeting criteria for a probable bulimia nervosa diagnosis had the highest prevalence (5.8 %, 95 % CI 4.6–7.1) and anorexia nervosa had the lowest prevalence (0.34 %, 95 % CI 0.1–0.8). Boys and men who identified as gay (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.28, 95 % CI 1.35–3.85) or bisexual (AOR 2.22, 95 % CI 1.23–3.99) had higher odds of meeting criteria for any probable eating disorder diagnosis, compared to those who did not. Finally, boys and men who had a higher body mass index (BMI) (AOR 1.18, 95 % CI 1.14–1.23) had greater odds of meeting criteria for any probable eating disorder diagnosis. Findings add to the growing understanding of eating disorders among boys and men. Targeted and tailored prevention and intervention programming is needed for sexual minority boys and men, and those with higher BMIs.

From the linked article: 

A new study has found that over 1 in 5 boys and men in Canada and the United States may meet the diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder, highlighting the urgent need for greater awareness, tailored prevention efforts, and inclusive clinical support for this under-recognized group.

Published using data from The Study of Boys and Men, the research analyzed responses from over 1,500 boys and men aged 15 to 35. Researchers used a validated diagnostic algorithm to assess probable eating disorders and examined key sociodemographic factors. The study found that 21.3% of participants met criteria for any probable eating disorder. Probable bulimia nervosa had the highest prevalence (5.8%), while probable anorexia nervosa was least common (0.34%).

The study revealed heightened risk among sexual minority participants: those who identified as gay and bisexual had significantly higher odds of meeting any eating disorder criteria compared to their heterosexual peers. Higher body mass index (BMI) was also associated with greater likelihood of probable diagnosis.

“These findings signal a clear call to action,” said Kyle T. Ganson, PhD, MSW, the lead author on the study. “Boys and men—particularly those who are sexual minorities or in larger bodies—are at increased risk for eating disorders. Yet they remain overlooked in public health messaging and clinical practice.”

The research team stresses the importance of developing prevention and intervention programs that are gender-inclusive and responsive to the unique experiences of boys and men. “Boys and men often face unique barriers to seeking help for eating disorders, including feelings of stigma and shame, fear of judgment, and a lack of gender-affirming treatment options,” said Ganson. “Given the high prevalence of eating disorders in our study, there is an urgent need to reduce these barriers and ensure that all individuals struggling with eating disorders receive timely, compassionate care.”",2025-04-22 02:19:27,22,mvea,science

We entirely depend on a trauma response to be ok with it: “my parents did this so it must be ok” and those same people will almost never look into because they think they can’t change it (they can do restoration and get some damage repaired) but often it’s too painful to consider it might have been bad they were cut.

I don't know what makes it so hard to recognize that the same behavior is present in men A LOT.

if you want to look a certain way or just perform for your sport you simply need to acknowledge that diet plays a significant role. just because you don't listen to your lizard brain when it says you are full (or not) when you are tracking what you eat and know you are eating appropriately does not make it an ED.

""The study revealed that higher amount of perpetration attributed to a triangle predicts that the triangle is perceived as male, and higher amount of perceived victimhood predicts a triangle is seen as female. There was no significant difference in this respect between the two cultural groups (Chinese managers and Norwegian students). Female participants were more likely to classify the orange triangle as female and green as male; the authors suggest this may indicate women are more likely to assume male perpetration and female victimhood.""

https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Femo0001490

Abstract

We investigated whether sadness leaves an “emotional residue” by inducing sadness in one individual and testing its transfer to an unaware new acquaintance. Participants (N = 230; 115 dyads) completed cooperative tasks in same-gender dyads. Before meeting, participants recalled a personal event. In half the dyads, one participant (sad actor) recalled a sad event, while their partner (sad-paired partner) recalled a neutral event. In control dyads, both participants recalled neutral events. We examined self-reported emotions, affective language, behavior, and measures of sympathetic arousal to capture physiologic linkage—the degree to which one partner’s physiology at one moment, predicted their partner’s physiology the next moment. Men in the sad actor condition exhibited greater engagement (smiled more, gestured more) and their partners showed stronger physiologic linkage than men in the control condition. Conversely, women in the sad actor condition were less expressive than women in the control condition (smiled less), and their partners showed weaker physiologic linkage to them compared to dyads in the control condition. These findings have important implications for how men and women regulate negative affect and respond to others’ affective cues.

From the linked article:

Sadness “leaks” into social behavior and physiology—and men may overcompensate

When someone experiences sadness before a social interaction, the effects may linger—even if they try to hide it. A new study published in Emotion suggests that these subtle emotional residues can influence both behavior and physiological responses in social interactions. Interestingly, the study also found that men and women may express sadness differently when meeting new people. Men who had just recalled a sad event appeared more engaged during the interaction, while women tended to withdraw.

The researchers found that sadness did not disappear during the interaction—it showed up in subtle but measurable ways. “One of the main takeaways is that even a brief moment of sadness (e.g., reflecting on a personal experience for a few minutes) can have a lingering effect on behavior, and in turn, affect how others respond to you,” del Rosario said. “However, people don’t always respond in the ways you might expect.”

These effects, however, were shaped by gender. Men who had recalled a sad event smiled and gestured more during the interaction than men in the control group.

Men’s behavior appeared to signal increased engagement, and their partners showed stronger physiological linkage to them. This suggests that even though the men may have tried to conceal their sadness, their behavior drew their partner in and shaped how connected the pair became.

In contrast, women who had recalled a sad event smiled less than their partners, signaling disengagement. These women also did not elicit strong physiologic linkage in their partners. Female pairs in which one member had recalled a sad event appeared less attuned to each other than those in the control group. In short, sadness appeared to lead to greater social withdrawal for women and greater visible engagement for men.

The researchers interpret this difference in light of social norms. Sadness is often viewed as more socially acceptable for women than for men. Men may feel pressure to avoid appearing vulnerable, especially when interacting with other men.",2025-04-21 10:07:19,19,mvea,science

mlclxr2,1jr8bb9,reddit,"From the article: You don’t often find crowds of people flocking together to take in the pungent scent of rotting flesh, but that’s exactly what happens every time a corpse flower blooms at a public garden. In fact, thousands turned out to get close to the flower of the world’s stinkiest plant in January in Australia. It proved such a drawcard that Sydney’s Royal Botanic Gardens kept the gates open until late at night to accommodate the eager fans.

“Usually, you have to get close to a flower to be able to smell it,” said biologist Olivia Murrell. “That is not true for the corpse flower. The second you walk into its greenhouse, its smell smacks you across the face. It’s very strong. The plant also heats up when it blooms, which spreads its smell farther.”

While the endangered plant is increasingly threatened by habitat destruction and climate change, biologists from Northwestern University and the Chicago Botanic Garden have [uncovered](https://academic.oup.com/aob/advance-article/doi/10.1093/aob/mcaf038/8104011) that it’s facing another huge challenge for survival: Poor record keeping.

The scientists discovered this potentially fatal flaw while putting together the genetic ancestry of 1,200 corpse flowers currently living in 111 gardens and other institutions around the world. They found so many holes in the data collected on these plants that conservationists undertaking breeding programs inadvertently narrowed the genetic pool in the process. The researchers found that of the plants they studied, 24% were direct clones and 27% were the offspring from two closely related corpse flowers. As any biologist, ecologist or zoologist will tell you, this can be a death sentence for an entire species.

And much like in the animal kingdom – yes, including in humans – inbreeding among small populations results in a suite of evolutionarily disadvantageous traits that hamper health and survival.

“There are many risks associated with low genetic diversity,” said Murrell, who led the study. “Decreasing genetic diversity over time leads to a decrease in fitness. Generally speaking, inbred plants might not produce as much pollen or might die right after they flower. One institution reported that, possibly as a result of inbreeding, all their corpse flower offspring were albino, so they didn’t survive because they didn’t have chlorophyll to photosynthesize.",2025-04-04 10:08:23,71,chrisdh79,science

 Amorphophallus is basically extinct in the wild, and that they flower in the wrong order isn't helping things. 

Inbreeding isn't great for the species, but with such a small population to begin with, I don't really see a great solution. With how difficult they are to raise, you're lucky to get viable seed at all, let alone a good genetic cross.

I should also point out that Amorphophallus is in a much better state, from a conservation perspective, than many other exotics.

Unsafe Driving During School Drop Offs at ‘Unacceptable’ Levels

Road sign warning of school and children nearby.

Double Parking, Not Obeying Traffic Controls and Other Unsafe Behaviour Witnessed at 98% of Schools Studied

Risky driving by parents and other motorists who do the school run is putting children in danger, according to a study published in the peer-reviewed journal Traffic Injury Prevention.

Double parking, not obeying traffic controls and other unsafe behavior occurs at the majority (98%) of elementary schools during morning drop-off times.

The authors analyzed data from more than 500 schools in Canada and say hazardous driving is an “urgent and serious” issue. The most observed misdemeanour was to drop a student on the opposite side of the street which meant the child had to cross in the middle of the block with no traffic controls.

The researchers warn that unsafe driving increases (by 45%, as demonstrated in previous research) the chance of a car crash involving child pedestrians and other vulnerable road users such as cyclists. In addition, parents are even more likely to drive their children to lessons instead of them walking or using other active forms of transportation.",2025-04-12 03:34:11,56,mvea,science

mkhyqi2,1jn9a3f,reddit,"Interesting. This kind of supports the research that's been popping up that appears to suggest that narcissism might not fit the general idea of the dark triad and that psychopathy and machiavellianism are looking more likely to be different expressions of the same thing and it might make more sense to distinguish between a dark dyad and narcissism. Although, this might be due to a failure to correctly conceptualize machiavellianism.

https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/01461672241276562

Abstract

Increasing honesty is critical in modern society. Moral Disengagement Tactics (MDTs) enable individuals to engage in unethical behavior while avoiding self-criticism, making MDTs a form of self-persuasion. One way to prevent persuasion is inoculation. Across three experiments (N = 972), two preregistered, we randomly assigned individuals to a code of ethics versus inoculation to MDTs condition. Study 1 (n = 443) found that those high in narcissism reported increased ethical intentions in the inoculation condition. Study 2 (n = 224) replicated and extended this effect, finding that individuals high in narcissism were more likely to behave honestly in the inoculation condition. Study 3 (n = 305) was a longitudinal study finding that inoculating those high in narcissism led to fewer lies over the past week’s inoculation. None of these interaction patterns emerged for Machiavellianism or psychopathy. Thus, inoculation to MDTs appears effective in reducing dishonesty among those high in narcissism.

From the linked article: 

A new study published in the journal Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin has found that individuals high in narcissism may be more likely to behave ethically when they are exposed to a specific kind of message designed to prevent rationalizations for bad behavior. Across three experiments, researchers found that people who scored high on narcissism—often associated with entitlement and self-centeredness—were less likely to cheat or lie after receiving a psychological “inoculation” that made unethical justifications seem less persuasive.

The researchers, led by Daniel N. Jones of the University of Nevada, Reno, were interested in exploring a new approach to ethical training, particularly for individuals who are more prone to dishonesty but still care about maintaining a positive self-image. Rather than relying solely on traditional codes of ethics, the team investigated whether an “inoculation” strategy could protect against the rationalizations that often lead to unethical decisions.

The inoculation message, in contrast, warned that unethical behavior, even when it seems harmless or justified, can damage reputations and lead to serious consequences. It explained several common rationalizations people use to excuse bad behavior—such as blaming others, minimizing harm, or using euphemistic language—and countered each one to help individuals resist these faulty justifications.

Across all three studies, the inoculation approach consistently influenced only those high in narcissism. The researchers argue that this makes sense given what is known about narcissistic individuals. People high in narcissism often feel entitled and are motivated by personal gain, but they also care deeply about how they are perceived by others and want to maintain a positive self-image. This internal conflict makes them more likely to rely on rationalizations when they behave unethically—and more receptive to an intervention that targets those rationalizations.

In contrast, individuals high in psychopathy often lack guilt or concern for others and are unlikely to experience internal conflict about their actions, while those high in Machiavellianism may see dishonesty as a strategic tool rather than something to justify.",2025-03-30 10:06:49,64,mvea,science

Abstract

U.S. democracy appears to have weakened during the 21st century. Scholars have raised concerns that this democratic backsliding will reduce favorable views of the U.S. among foreign citizens in other democracies. In turn, observers predict that the eroded global image of the U.S. will undercut its ability to win foreign policy cooperation from international partners. We assess these views using three multinational survey experiments fielded in twelve countries with 11,810 respondents. The results show that information about U.S. democratic backsliding indeed decreases respondents’ favorability toward the U.S. However, in our exploratory analysis, we find little evidence that it decreases support for cooperating with the U.S. While America’s global image may suffer from international reporting focused on the degradation of its longstanding democratic system, its ability to garner support for critical policies seems resilient in some important partner countries.",2025-04-04 23:54:33,5,mvea,science

mk8v3g8,1jm4opw,reddit,"Using PET imaging, researchers have gained valuable insight into how dopamine production impacts executive function. 

Cognitive flexibility is critical to the ability to adapt behavior to changing environments. It is driven by dopamine production, with higher levels providing greater flexibility and those who have lower levels often struggling with adaptability during certain tasks. 

This latest research allowed researchers to study the release of dopamine in the brain using radiotracers to track it during two sets of tasks. The team, who published their findings in the Journal of Nuclear Medicine, is hopeful their findings could guide the development of new treatments for psychiatric and neurological disorders.  

“At the neurotransmitter level, the dopamine system has been linked to cognitive flexibility. A direct neurochemical response to cognitive flexibility, however, has yet to be shown,” Isabelle Miederer, PhD, associate professor in the department of nuclear medicine at University Medical Center Mainz in Germany, and colleagues noted. “In our study, we sought to examine the release of dopamine in real time by performing PET scans while individuals completed behavioral flexibility tasks.”

> ""Damage to world GDP in 2100 under SSP5-8.5, averaged across both econometric models and climate models increases from ∼11% under models without global weather to ∼40% if global weather is included.""

The large increase in damage when global weather is taken into account is interesting, and is a useful contribution.

However, [SSP5-8.5 is known to be unrealistic](https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-what-the-new-ipcc-report-says-about-how-to-limit-warming-to-1-5c-or-2c/), and in fact [both SSP5-8.5 and SSP3-7.0 are no longer considered realistic in the scientific literature](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adb6be), so it's unfortunate that the paper is based on assumptions that are known to be unrealistic.

Of note:  
> ""we demonstrate that when the damage function used in a recent IAM is estimated from empirical models augmented with global weather conditions, they reduce the welfare-optimal amount of climate change from ∼2.7C to ∼1.7C which is consistent with the Paris Agreement targets.""

1.7C is close to the amount of warming expected from SSP1-2.6 ([IPCC WGI p.14](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf), which they use as their baseline for comparison.  That is also broadly in line with [IEA estimates for warming (p.232)](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/5e9122fc-9d5b-4f18-8438-dac8b39b702a/WorldEnergyOutlook2024.pdf) based on their mid-case APS scenario which [historically has been more accurate](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1g6k1n4/solar_surge_will_send_coal_power_tumbling_by_2030/lsl1qsq/) than their pessimistic STEPS scenario.",2025-04-01 16:25:36,9,grundar,science

I think they did a decent enough job examining the shortcomings and narrowness of the study and I could definitely see increased gratitude being a useful tool in preventing/lessening certain types of depression. Especially since the study focused on middle schoolers who are going to be very concerned with keeping up with their peers and fitting in socially. 

However, I worry people will read the headline and take away from it that this works across the board with all types of depression and that's just not true. If you're depressed because your brain has a chemical imbalance, hearing you should just be grateful won't fix anything and will only increase feelings of guilt until the root cause is addressed with medication. Then once you're stabilized on meds, you can start working on things like increasing gratefulness. Sort of like if you broke your leg, they wouldn't send you straight to physical therapy to fix it. They'd put a cast on you first to fix the majority of the problem and then use physical therapy as a support to get you back to normal life after the main issue was taken care of.",2025-04-06 22:34:03,5,damnportlander,science

Abstract 

This research investigates the developmental trajectories of gratitude and its influence on adolescent depression, along with the mediating role of self-esteem. Six hundred and sixty adolescents were assessed thrice over two years for gratitude, self-esteem, and depression.

Four gratitude trajectories emerged: ‘Low-gratitude-persistence’ (35.9%), ‘High-gratitude-increasing’ (29.5%), ‘High-gratitude-declined’ (23.5%) and ‘Low-gratitude-improving’ (11.1%). ‘Low-gratitude-improving’ group and ‘High-gratitude-increasing’ group demonstrated a reduced risk of adolescents’ depression, with the ‘Low-gratitude-persistence’ group as the reference group. The ‘High-gratitude-declined’ group did not show a higher risk for depression than the ‘Low-gratitude-persistence’ group. Using the ‘Low-gratitude-persistence’ group as the reference, self-esteem mediated the effects of the ‘Low-gratitude-improving’ and ‘High-gratitude-increasing’ groups on depression, with both trajectories enhancing self-esteem, which then reduced depression.

Gratitude trajectories are associated with depression in middle school adolescents, while self-esteem plays a mediating role. The findings have important implications for enhancing the mental health of adolescents by improving their gratitude and self-esteem levels.

From the linked article: 

New psychology research links gratitude development to lower adolescent depression

A new study published in The Journal of Positive Psychology suggests that adolescents who become more grateful over time are less likely to experience depression—especially when their gratitude boosts their self-esteem. The research tracked hundreds of middle school students in China and found that distinct patterns in how gratitude developed over time were closely linked with levels of depression.

The researchers then looked at how these patterns related to depression in the final year of middle school. They found that students in the two increasing-gratitude groups—both those who started high and increased, and those who started low but improved—reported significantly lower depression scores than students in the low-gratitude-persistence group.

In contrast, students whose gratitude declined over time did not differ in depression levels from those with persistently low gratitude. This suggests that both the level and the direction of change in gratitude matter for adolescent mental health. Merely starting out with high gratitude did not protect students from depression if their gratitude declined during this critical period.",2025-04-06 17:50:18,-3,mvea,science

The issue is that a lot of people who *are* overweight or obese even when considering body fat will deflect with the ""but athletes/bodybuilders are also considered obese"" excuse even though they themselves have nowhere near the muscle mass of an athlete or bodybuilder.

Also, some risks of obesity (such as potential joint issues) remain present even when the added weight is from muscle mass. Some comorbidities are a direct result of increased overall weight, regardless of what is weighing the person down.",2025-04-19 05:18:41,883,DimensioT,science

mnvuoxw,1k2ofjc,reddit,"Ex-sportsdietitian here, the BMI misconceptions are getting a bit ridiculous at this point. 

Sure, BMI *alone* does not prove obesity or being overweight, but we also do not use it in isolation. It is one value of many, and it is a useful value; something people seem to be thinking is not the case since it cannot be used on its own. 

It is quite like telling me that knowing my client's age or weight is entirely pointless, because those values do not tell me anything about their health or performance on their own. 

Yes, true. Which is why we also look at those other details to get a full picture and be able to give an accurate diagnosis where applicable, as well as recommendations. 

None of us, ever, have looked at a BMI of 29 and diagnosed our clients as being overweight, as we looked up from our screens and saw their athletic physiques, right before we performed body fat measurements and fat-free mass calculations. 

Looks aren't everything though, and BMI helps detect possible problems, indicating *more tests need to be done*, which you otherwise would not necessarily do. It also helps as a progression tool.

Lastly, it helps tremendously in groups. While BMI alone is not an end-all-be-all value, most people are not exceptions, believe it or not.

mom5vpx,1k5wd0g,reddit,At the end of the article it is suggested that a similar treatment might be used for brain and spinal cord injuries. If so this might be one of the most significant discoveries in history. ,2025-04-23 14:38:48,435,Magog14,science
mol6tph,1k5wd0g,reddit,"From the article: For some creatures, a lost body part is not necessarily a permanent affair. Salamanders can regrow limbs and zebrafish can rebuild their retinas. Yet mammals — including humans — are largely stuck with what they’re born with. When vision is lost to degenerative diseases like retinitis pigmentosa, it stays lost.

But a team of scientists in South Korea may have found a way to change that.

In a discovery that could reshape how we treat blindness, the researchers at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST) have developed a therapy that restores vision by prompting the retina to heal itself. The treatment, tested in mice, triggered long-term regeneration of nerve cells in the retina — something previously thought impossible in mammals.

Inside our eyes, a special kind of cell called Müller glia keeps watch. These cells protect the retina, maintaining its structure and supporting its neurons. In fish and amphibians, they do even more. They can transform into new neurons, repairing retinal damage. In mammals, however, that regenerative process is switched off. Once the retina is harmed, it stays that way.

Why can’t our Müller glia do the same? The answer, it turns out, may lie in an unexpected molecular stowaway.

The new study, [published](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58290-8) in Nature Communications, zooms in on a protein called Prox1. In mammals, this protein appears to travel between cells and land inside Müller glia, where it acts like a molecular handbrake, preventing these cells from reprogramming into neuron-generating machines.",2025-04-23 11:04:40,240,chrisdh79,science

I rarely traveled with peers and when i did it helped but it was still extremely lonely.

When you're in a club at 3am and everyone is partying you're on the highest of highs, then you go back to your hotel to sleep till 10,11 am then checkout. Get some quick food and head to the next city, more often than not, alone. I tried to enjoy the sights and take it all in but the loneliness was extreme.

mnmvphy,1k1g8ym,reddit,"I put in thousands of hours and made, especially social, sacrifices to become a professional musician. I had a late start and so designated most of my time in my late teens and early 20’s to practising.

Just before Covid came around, I was starting to get a lot more attention and had a lot of gigs lined up that immediately went away due to the lockdowns. i consequently realised how vulnerable the profession made me.

So I set up an electronics business, and while it was initially sad to have to leave music (to an extent), it actually turned out to be a blessing in disguise. I built and developed cognitive skills that meant I became a better musician without having to put any work in on my instrument. I became less attached to practising every day or very regularly, which incidentally caused a lot of mental tension that I wasn’t as aware of as I should have been. 

Music is a very ethereal thing. Quite a spiritual thing, I would say. If you aren’t grounded in a physical lifestyle that has you dealing with tangible physical reality, it can easily lead to overthinking.

Most veterans I know, among the many other reasons they joined, did so out of at least some sense of general patriotism and loyalty to the American people and the ideals of the nation. 

While any population will have venal jerkholes in it, Veterans tend to have already filtered a lot of those people out by the time it comes to do other things after serving. Meaning that if someone is still a venal jerkhole after serving, they're really good at it.

So Veterans who become politicians tend to fall into either the real patriot and civil servant mold, or they fall into the jingoistic show-patriot mold. I think we're lucky that most veterans do fall into the good mold, but I can absolutely think of a couple who are, if not jerkholes, then definitely jerkhole-shaped.",2025-04-08 13:33:24,169,BuccaneerRex,science

https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10659129241298960

Abstract

Congress is more polarized than ever. At the same time, there are fewer military veterans serving in Congress than ever before. Candidates with military experience, along with their supporters, argue that electing more veterans could help reduce dysfunction and gridlock. They claim that military values, such as duty and teamwork, translate into differences in legislative behavior. But are veteran lawmakers more effective than those without military experience? Are they more bipartisan? Using House data from the 104th to 116th Congresses (1995–2021), I examine the extent to which military experience influences a lawmaker’s ability to legislate and engage in bipartisan behavior. I find that veteran lawmakers are more effective at advancing consequential legislation. Additionally, veterans appear more willing to collaborate with members of the opposite party, especially in recent Congresses. These effects are particularly evident among those who served on active duty. I conclude by considering the implications of these findings for maintaining healthy civil-military relations in America.

From the linked article: 

Veteran lawmakers are more effective and bipartisan, study finds

A new study published in Political Research Quarterly suggests that members of the United States House of Representatives with military experience are more effective at passing legislation and more likely to work with colleagues across party lines. These differences are especially pronounced among veterans who served on active duty. As Congress faces ongoing dysfunction and deepening polarization, these findings lend support to the growing argument that electing more veterans could help improve legislative performance and cooperation.

Across all 13 Congresses studied, lawmakers with military backgrounds were consistently more effective at advancing significant legislation. On average, veterans scored higher on legislative effectiveness, and those who served on active duty stood out the most. Even after accounting for other factors that influence effectiveness—such as seniority, committee positions, and party leadership—veteran status remained a positive predictor of legislative success. In statistical terms, active-duty veterans were about 20 percent more effective than their nonveteran peers, a difference roughly half the size of the advantage gained by being in the majority party.

The data also showed that veterans played a key role in moving high-impact legislation forward. Although they made up only about a quarter of lawmakers in the dataset, veterans were responsible for nearly half of all substantive and significant bills introduced between 1995 and 2021. About a third of these efforts came from active-duty veterans, highlighting their outsized influence. In terms of outcomes, veterans were more likely to see their bills progress at each stage of the legislative process. For instance, about 25 percent of veterans had at least one major bill become law, compared to just 12 percent of nonveterans.",2025-04-08 10:07:11,60,mvea,science

mkhl160,1jn7s6w,reddit,"When someone has a stroke, it can accelerate the loss of cognitive ability over the coming years.

Stroke survivors who have attended some level of higher education may face even steeper mental declines, according to a study led by Michigan Medicine.

In an analysis of cognitive outcomes for more than 2,000 patients seen for stroke between 1971 and 2019, college graduates performed better on initial post-stroke examinations of global cognition, a measure of overall cognitive ability that includes mental functions like memory, attention and processing speed.

However, stroke survivors who attended any level of higher education had faster declines in executive functioning — skills used to manage everyday tasks, such as working memory and problem solving — compared to patients with less than a high school degree.

“Brain atrophy occurs over time regardless of education level,” said Mellanie V. Springer, M.D., M.S., first author and Thomas H and Susan C Brown Early Career Professor of Neurology at University of Michigan Medical School.

“Our findings suggest that attending higher education may enable people to retain greater cognitive ability until a critical threshold of brain injury is reached after a stroke. At this point, compensation may fail, and rapid cognitive decline occurs.”

For years, researchers have considered education level as a predictor of cognitive reserve, the ability to preserve higher levels of functioning despite brain injury that occurs over the course of life.

This led Springer and her colleagues to hypothesize that highly educated people would have slower cognitive decline after a stroke.

The results, published in JAMA Network Open, reflect the opposite.

This is a rather convoluted way to say: People who use their brains more have more initial resilience to brain injury, so they retain their abilities longer. But eventually the brain reaches a limit to what it can do to compensate.

Abstract

Although exposure to dysfunctional parenting styles in childhood can have lasting, negative impacts on overall functioning into adulthood, it remains unclear why. We explored the idea that perceived dysfunctional parenting may influence the cultivation of antisocial personality traits that remain into adulthood and account for links between perceived dysfunctional parenting and current life impairment. As such, in an adult sample (N = 446; Mage = 46.10; 51% female; 78.0% White), we investigated whether one’s current level of sadism and psychopathy mediated the relationship between reports of perceived exposure to dysfunctional parenting in childhood and current functional impairment, beyond effects of basic personality such as agreeableness and conscientiousness. Participants completed validated measures of sadism, psychopathy, agreeableness, conscientiousness, perceived dysfunctional parenting, and functional impairment. We found that perceived dysfunctional parenting styles (i.e., maternal indifference, maternal abuse, maternal/paternal overcontrol) experienced during childhood enhanced current functional impairment via heightened levels of current psychopathy; however, these effects became nonsignificant when including agreeableness and conscientiousness in modeling. Moreover, conscientiousness partially mediated effects of maternal indifference, maternal abuse, and maternal/paternal overcontrol on functional impairment. Perceived dysfunctional parenting in childhood may contribute to the cultivation of personality constructs that are maintained into adulthood that influence present-day functional impairment.

From the linked article: 

Adults who experienced dysfunctional parenting in childhood may struggle more with daily functioning later in life, and this could be partly due to the way those early experiences shape their personality. A new study published in Psychological Reports found that individuals who reported neglectful, abusive, or overly controlling parenting styles in their upbringing were more likely to experience current impairments in areas such as work, relationships, and emotional well-being. Interestingly, this connection seemed to be linked not to sadistic or psychopathic traits, as initially expected, but to lower levels of conscientiousness—a basic personality trait that includes being organized, responsible, and self-disciplined.

The results suggested that people who perceived their parents as neglectful, abusive, or overly controlling were more likely to report having difficulties functioning in adulthood. In the initial models, these links were explained in part by higher levels of psychopathy—but not sadism. That is, individuals who experienced dysfunctional parenting in childhood were more likely to score higher on psychopathy, which in turn was associated with more functional impairment in adulthood.

However, when the researchers included conscientiousness and agreeableness in their models, the picture changed. The effects of psychopathy disappeared, and the link between dysfunctional parenting and adult impairment was instead explained by low conscientiousness. This means that people who had more negative parenting experiences were also more likely to score lower on conscientiousness, which was then linked to greater functional problems.",2025-04-11 12:04:09,50,mvea,science

Give every participant in this study an attachment interview, code it for neglectful or abusive events, and include a section on their attachment classification to provide other professionals context.

‘It’s a shot, not a vaccine like MMR’: New scepticism prompts call for action

A new type of ‘vaccine scepticism’ has been uncovered by researchers at Lancaster University, who examined a nine-million-word corpus of tweets looking at vaccine comparisons and evaluations.

They focused on claims that some vaccines, notably those against COVID-19, were not perceived by some people posting on Twitter/X as ‘proper’ vaccines.

Based on their findings they suggest it would be helpful for future public health messaging to address potential confusion among the public about what counts as a vaccine.

This ‘vaccine is not a vaccine’ is a new, previously unreported type of vaccine-specific scepticism, and it arose only during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it might, according to the researchers, also apply to the flu vaccine.",2025-03-28 04:12:33,51,mvea,science

With a normal, traditional vaccine, you are injected most commonly with a weakened strain or a dead strain of whatever we are trying to protect against.

This vaccine, however, doesn't work like that.  Now we are injecting with MRNA, which goes into your cells and tells them to start making a certain protein.  If I remember correctly the protein they targeted was the spike protein that gave covid its identifiable shape.   Once your body produces those proteins, your body starts seeing them as a foreign invader and attack it.

While I did get the vaccine, I can understand why people were concerned about this new technology.  Traditional vaccines use the same method of immunity we have always used throughout time, your immune system killing something and learning how to kill it in the future.  The part that is worrisome is the highjacking of the cells biological processes.  So far, it seems to be working ok.

> They identified two mixtures - of 8 and 15 constituents, respectively - that did correlate with slight effects. Only one of the mixtures included the kind of 'chemical suspects' that one expects to find in such studies, the two synthetic sweeteners, aspartame and sucralose. The associations between the mixtures and the condition were very weak, and similar mixtures that included many of the same constituents showed no association. Of course, association does not equal causation. The researchers mention this, but you have to read a long way into the paper to find it. It's not mentioned in the abstract and the title of the paper includes only the merest hint of association, let alone causation.

> Although it has involved a lot of work - not just by the 23 authors of this paper, but by the 100,000 people who were surveyed - the results are weak. I wondered why this was ever published. The answer may have something to do with 'publish-or-perish' or the journals' approach to 'put the work out there' and let the scientific community decide on its validity. This can lead to sensationalism, but I don't think it will in this case because it's not sensational enough.""

Emeritus Professor Jennie Brand-Miller:

> Both mechanisms would therefore be expected to REDUCE the risk of type 2 diabetes, not increase it. I suspect these findings are simply chance findings because the researchers were ‘fishing’ and looked at so many food additives. 

Dr Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz:

> It's also unclear what meaning these results have. The biggest risk increase in the study was seen for Mixture 5, which contained 14 different food additives including citric acid and paprika extract. But due to the complex methodology the authors used to create these mixtures, it’s not clear how you could implement these findings in your daily life. The closest the authors come is saying that it might be a good idea to reduce your soft drink intake, but we didn’t really need this study to know that.

Abstract

Can AI bolster state-backed propaganda campaigns, in practice? Growing use of AI and large language models has drawn attention to the potential for accompanying tools to be used by malevolent actors. Though recent laboratory and experimental evidence has substantiated these concerns in principle, the usefulness of AI tools in the production of propaganda campaigns has remained difficult to ascertain. Drawing on the adoption of generative-AI techniques by a state-affiliated propaganda site with ties to Russia, we test whether AI adoption enabled the website to amplify and enhance its production of disinformation. First, we find that the use of generative-AI tools facilitated the outlet’s generation of larger quantities of disinformation. Second, we find that use of generative-AI coincided with shifts in the volume and breadth of published content. Finally, drawing on a survey experiment comparing perceptions of articles produced prior to and following the adoption of AI tools, we show that the AI-assisted articles maintained their persuasiveness in the postadoption period. Our results illustrate how generative-AI tools have already begun to alter the size and scope of state-backed propaganda campaigns.

From the linked article:

Russian propaganda campaign used AI to scale output without sacrificing credibility, study finds

A new study published in PNAS Nexus shows that generative artificial intelligence has already been adopted in real-world disinformation campaigns. By analyzing a Russian-backed propaganda site, researchers found that AI tools significantly increased content production without diminishing the perceived credibility or persuasiveness of the messaging.

To study this transition, the researchers scraped the entire archive of DC Weekly articles posted between April and November 2023, totaling nearly 23,000 stories. They pinpointed September 20, 2023, as the likely start of AI use, based on the appearance of leaked language model prompts embedded in articles. From this point onward, the site no longer simply copied articles. Instead, it rewrote them in original language, while maintaining the same underlying facts and media. The researchers were able to trace many of these AI-generated articles back to source content from outlets like Fox News or Russian state media.

After adopting AI tools, the outlet more than doubled its daily article production. Statistical models confirmed that this increase was unlikely to be a coincidence. The researchers also found evidence that AI was used not just for writing, but also for selecting and framing content. Some prompt leaks showed the AI being asked to rewrite articles with specific ideological slants, such as criticizing U.S. support for Ukraine or favoring Republican political figures.",2025-04-17 03:55:47,22,mvea,science

mkipr8u,1jnd4mf,reddit,"From the article: Stimulant medications like methylphenidate (sold under brand names such as Ritalin) are widely used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The drug works by increasing levels of dopamine and noradrenaline—neurotransmitters that play key roles in focus, attention, and impulse control.

However, in recent years, many individuals without ADHD—particularly students—have begun using these medications in hopes of boosting concentration and academic performance.

The growing popularity of these so-called “smart drugs” has raised important questions about whether stimulant medications genuinely enhance cognitive abilities in healthy individuals. While earlier research has shown that such drugs may improve working memory and processing speed, much of that work has focused on higher doses or clinical populations.

The [current study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hup.70002) aimed to explore whether a lower dose (10 mg) of methylphenidate could provide cognitive benefits while minimizing potential side effects.

Led by Amie C. Hayley, researchers at Swinburne University of Technology in Australia conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study involving 25 healthy adults (36% female, aged 21 to 45 years). Each participant received either a 10 mg dose of methylphenidate or a placebo in two separate sessions, spaced one week apart.

Participants then completed a series of cognitive tasks designed to assess reaction time, working memory, and visual attention. The study also incorporated eye-tracking technology to evaluate whether the drug affected visual scanning behavior.

The results were mixed. Participants performed better on a numeric working memory task after taking methylphenidate, making fewer errors and demonstrating improved accuracy compared to when they received the placebo.

However, the drug did not improve other aspects of cognitive performance, including reaction time, general working memory, or visual scanning efficiency.",2025-03-30 14:06:39,154,chrisdh79,science

mkkkflc,1jnd4mf,reddit,"Diagnosed with adhd as a kid but stopped medicating around grade 2. Last year I started again, and started with concerta. 

The first day I took it, I went outside and it was like a new world. I was in the moment without any running thoughts or intruding thoughts. I looked around and just processed everything in a new way. My mind was so quiet I could actively enjoy the view and outside in a way I never did. It's hard to explain but it's like it shut off something and allowed me to understand and reason with myself. I no longer was afraid/anxiety of anything and I felt like a normal person.

That didn't last long as the crashs were enough to make me worse then before medicating, and the duration varied day to day so it was very unreliable. I'd take it around 7am, and it would noticeably kick in around 8, I could focus on stuff because I didn't have the distracting thoughts, and think and do on demand without procrastination. By 12/1 I would start getting tired, frustered, anxiety driven etc and by 4/5 I'd be back to how I felt previously.

I switched from that to ritalin, then biphentin, then vyanse.

Vyvanse gave me an immense energy boost. I was ready to go go go. It didn't give the same mental effects, in fact I think it was almost the opposite. Instead of quieting my brain, it allowed me to understand the racing thoughts and rationalize them. I had trouble doing things because I was always thinking about something else. I would take 7am, and didn't find it had a noticeable kick in, but around 830/9am I would notice myself thinking better and wanting to do more. It didn't have the same social effects like Concerta, where with that I wanted to see friends, make plans, go out etc but didnt have the energy. Vyvanse gave me the energy to do that stuff, but i didn't have the mental drive to do it. I found myself flustered and frustered alot because I would be actively working on something, but my thoughts would be elsewhere pulling me away. I found I became alot more intensely focused on certain things and couldn't pull myself away despite knowing I had to. I just didn't have the will to control my body with my mind and it's like there was a disconnect. I started at 20mg and went up to 50mg.

2 weeks ago, I started Adderall. So far, it seems different. It slows my mind, but doesn't help the distractions. I have alot of ideas floating around now and things I need to get done. But I find myself unable to stop doing distracting things. Perfect example is right now. I have spent about 20 minutes typing this, yet the whole time I have a voice telling me it's pointless and to get up and do something else, yet here I am typing away. I find it provides a small energy boost but without the spark Vyvanse had. I can do things but I don't feel the ""spark"" Vyvanse provided so it's like a duller feeling. I find myself going from topic to topic and leaving things unfinished, but I also am able to jump back into things alot easier without forgetting. 

I don't know why I wrote all this but hopefully somebody reads it and can take something away from it. Clearly the meds work very different subtle ways yet they aren't talked about in that way. Concerta/ritalin/biphentin are all methlyphenidate but provide varying effects. Amphetimine has several versions and each different effects also. There should be more clarification on how each works and what it helps and doesn't help. My doctor switched me from vyvanse to adderall, because I mentioned that it provided energy and not the mental clarity. So he thought adderall might help since it's a mix of amphetime salts. As of now, each pill has provided very different effects and helped in very specific areas that the others didn't. But they aren't looked at that way and instead just ""stimulants"".

Link to the research: [A natural experiment on the effect of herpes zoster vaccination on dementia](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08800-x)

Abstract:

>Neurotropic herpesviruses may be implicated in the development of dementia. Moreover, vaccines may have important off-target immunological effects. Here we aim to determine the effect of live-attenuated herpes zoster vaccination on the occurrence of dementia diagnoses. To provide causal as opposed to correlational evidence, we take advantage of the fact that, in Wales, eligibility for the zoster vaccine was determined on the basis of an individual’s exact date of birth. Those born before 2 September 1933 were ineligible and remained ineligible for life, whereas those born on or after 2 September 1933 were eligible for at least 1 year to receive the vaccine. Using large-scale electronic health record data, we first show that the percentage of adults who received the vaccine increased from 0.01% among patients who were merely 1 week too old to be eligible, to 47.2% among those who were just 1 week younger. Apart from this large difference in the probability of ever receiving the zoster vaccine, individuals born just 1 week before 2 September 1933 are unlikely to differ systematically from those born 1 week later. Using these comparison groups in a regression discontinuity design, we show that receiving the zoster vaccine reduced the probability of a new dementia diagnosis over a follow-up period of 7 years by 3.5 percentage points (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.6–7.1, P = 0.019), corresponding to a 20.0% (95% CI = 6.5–33.4) relative reduction. This protective effect was stronger among women than men. We successfully confirm our findings in a different population (England and Wales’s combined population), with a different type of data (death certificates) and using an outcome (deaths with dementia as primary cause) that is closely related to dementia, but less reliant on a timely diagnosis of dementia by the healthcare system. Through the use of a unique natural experiment, this study provides evidence of a dementia-preventing or dementia-delaying effect from zoster vaccination that is less vulnerable to confounding and bias than the existing associational evidence.",2025-04-02 16:22:55,43,Hrmbee,science

Splash-free urinals for global sustainability and accessibility: Design through physics and differential equations 

Abstract

Urinals are a staple of public spaces yet their designs have remained essentially stagnant for over a century. The use of urinals often results in significant splatter (splashback) as urine splashes upon impact with the urinal generating droplets which travel back onto the floor and user, which generates unhygienic environments, high cleaning costs, and adds unpleasant workload for custodial staff. Impinging stream angle is one of many factors that affect splashback. We theoretically predict and experimentally validate that when the impinging angle is below an invariant critical value of ⁠, the flow rate of splashback under human urination conditions can be significantly suppressed. We propose novel urinal designs that were generated by solving differential equations derived from the isogonal curve problem to ensure the urine stream impacts at or below this critical angle. Experiments validate that these designs can substantially reduce splashback to only 1.4% of the splash of a common contemporary commercial urinal. The widespread adoption of the urinal designs described in this work would result in considerable conservation of human resources, cost, cleaning chemicals, and water usage, rendering large-scale impacts on modern society by improving sustainability, hygiene, and accessibility.

From the linked article: 

Urinal designs have not materially changed in over a century. The style of urinal that was elevated to the status of artistic landmark by Marcel Duchamp in his 1917 dada art piece “La Fontaine” would not look out of place in today’s public restrooms. Use of a typical public urinal often results in splatter of urine outside the confines of the device—onto the floor and, most unpleasantly, onto the user, a situation that creates costly messes to clean and risks transmitting disease. Zhao Pan, Kaveeshan Thurairajah, and colleagues calculated that when the flow of urine impinges on the surface of the fixture at 30◦ or less, splashback is greatly reduced. Experimental results confirmed this. The authors then designed urinals by solving differential equations, dubbed Cornucopia and Nautilus, which have impinging angles at or below 30◦ across their entire area. The Nautilus design has an additional advantage: it fits a range of urination heights, making it easier for children and people who use wheelchairs to use. According to the authors, if the 56 million urinals in public restrooms in the US were replaced with the Nautilus, it would prevent one million liters of urine from splashing onto the floor each day.",2025-04-09 23:24:59,1,mvea,science

From the linked article: 

Brain Abnormalities Seen in Military Members with Blast Exposure

Study challenges the idea that “invisible” injuries are harmless

In military service members with a history of repetitive blast exposure, researchers found that higher blast exposure correlated with changes in the functional connectivity between brain regions, according to a study published in Radiology. Even when standard MRI exams appeared normal, the researchers found clear abnormalities using more advanced MRI techniques.

“We found that service members with more blast exposure had more severe symptoms—including memory problems, emotional difficulties and signs of post-traumatic stress disorder—and that their brains showed weaker connectivity in key areas,” said lead author Andrea Diociasi, MD, neuroradiologist and past research fellow in the Department of Radiology at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston. “In short, repeated trauma seems to weaken the brain’s internal communication.”

Traumatic brain injury has diverse negative consequences for military personnel, affecting both the brain’s structure and function. These effects are especially alarming for Special Operations Forces members who often face multiple blast injuries. Understanding the long-term neuroimaging implications of repeated blast injuries is challenging due to the variability of injuries in intensity, force and recurrence, underscoring the multiscale neurological implications of repeated trauma.",2025-04-05 12:10:31,30,mvea,science

Police officers fire more shots than civilians in homicides, research shows

A study in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine quantified the variation in rates of police firearm homicides and analyzed the number of gunshot wounds in police shootings as a measurement of lethality

An analysis using data from the US National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) has found that in homicides with police shooters, victims have been shot far more times than in homicides with civilians as shooters. The new study, appearing in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, published by Elsevier, showed that individuals aged 25 to 44, Black people, and those living outside the Northeast region of the US tend to be disproportionately killed by police as well as sustain a higher number of bullet wounds.

The researchers used data available from the NVDRS for 2005-2020 to analyze rates of police homicide and number of gunshot wounds among police homicides, across populations in 45 States and the District of Columbia (data were not available for California, Florida, Hawaii, South Dakota, and Texas, as they did not fully participate in NVDRS). About 6% of US firearm victims were shot by police. About 80% of police victims were shot multiple times, with a mean of six bullet wounds and a median of four bullet wounds. By contrast, about two thirds of homicide victims shot by civilians were shot multiple times, with a mean of four bullet wounds and a median of two bullet wounds.

Key findings of the study are:

- The overall rate of firearm homicide by police was 2.51 per million.
- Across age groups, the rates were highest for 25–34-year-olds (5.89 per million) and lowest for 55+ (1.03).
- By gender, the rate was 26 times higher for males compared to females (4.91 vs. 0.19).
- Black, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska Native individuals had more than twice the rate of firearm homicides than White individuals.
- Residents of the West were four times more likely than those of the Northeast to be victims of police firearm homicide (4.65 vs. 1.15).
- Most victims used a weapon during the incident (76%), although the proportion of weapon use was significantly lower among Black victims relative to White (69.3% vs. 78.0%).
- The variation in the number of gunshot wounds per victim across these groups was far less than the variation in rates of death.
- After accounting for weapon use, which could affect number of gunshot wounds, victims aged 35-44 had significantly more gunshot wounds than those aged 15-24 (6.41 vs. 5.73), Hispanic individuals had significantly more gunshot wounds than -- White individuals (6.61 vs 5.68 respectively), and victims in the Northeast had significantly fewer gunshot wounds than victims in any other region (4.68 vs. 5.69 – 6.55).",2025-04-23 04:25:25,2,mvea,science

mni7z58,1k104bl,reddit,"From the article: A [new study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656625000303) published in the Journal of Research in Personality suggests that intellectual humility—recognizing the possibility that one’s beliefs might be wrong—is linked to more constructive conflict behavior and greater relationship satisfaction in romantic couples. In particular, men who scored higher in intellectual humility tended to report stronger bonds with their partners and were also rated more favorably by those partners across several aspects of relationship quality.

Intellectual humility refers to the tendency to recognize that one’s own views could be flawed. The researchers behind the study were interested in how this mindset influences romantic relationships, especially during conflict. Disagreements are common in long-term partnerships, and how couples handle these disagreements can have a lasting impact on relationship satisfaction. While past research has highlighted the importance of communication skills and empathy, intellectual humility had not been closely examined as a factor in how couples navigate conflict.

“We were inspired to learn more about the many ways that intellectual humility manifests – from large-scale global affairs to everyday interpersonal interactions. The way that people navigate disagreements in close relationships is important to relationship quality and satisfaction and we were interested in the role that intellectual humility plays in such conflicts in romantic relationships,” explained study author Katrina P.

“They found that higher levels of intellectual humility in men were associated with higher relationship satisfaction—not only for the men themselves but also for their partners. Men who scored higher in humility also reported a stronger emotional bond with their partners and were seen by their partners as easier to get along with and less likely to engage in frequent arguments.”

“Interestingly, women’s intellectual humility was not significantly related to their partner’s relationship satisfaction or conflict experiences. It was, however, linked to their own perceptions. Women who were more intellectually humble saw themselves as behaving more constructively during disagreements and were more likely to believe that their partner had positive motives in conflicts, such as trying to understand them or find common ground.”

“One of the study’s more nuanced findings was that intellectual humility influenced not just how people acted, but how they perceived and responded to their partner’s actions. For instance, men who had female partners with higher humility were more likely to report that they themselves behaved better during arguments. This suggests that a partner’s humility may encourage more respectful and less reactive behavior, particularly among men who are otherwise average or lower in humility themselves.”

From the linked article: 

People with medical debt in 2023 were about five times more likely to forgo mental health care treatment in the following year due to cost, compared to those without medical debt, according to a study led by researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

For their study, the researchers analyzed 2023 and 2024 data from a nationwide survey related to mental health. The researchers found that 33.8% of respondents who reported having had medical debt in 2023 also reported forgoing mental health care for cost-related reasons in 2024, compared to 6.3% of respondents who reported not having medical debt in 2023 and forgoing care the following year.

Nearly one in four U.S. adults was living with a mental illness in 2022, and only about half were being treated, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. The large mental health treatment gap is thought to be, in part, due to costs of mental health care and the burden of existing medical debt—which about 20 million Americans are estimated to carry.

A minority of respondents—15.3%—reported having medical debt in 2023. Of these, about a third—33.8%—reported forgoing mental health care in 2024 due to the cost. In contrast, 84.7% reported not having medical debt in 2023. Of these, only 6.3% reported forgoing mental health care in 2024. When adjusting for other variables, including demographics and assets, the authors still found a 17.3 percentage point increase in the probability of forgoing care for adults with medical debt relative to no medical debt.",2025-04-18 20:42:04,7,mvea,science

My wife needs dental work, and both my wife and I and our oldest son are up for eyeglasses. I was able to make payment arrangements for the $4k bill but they’ll be taking pretty much what both my work and I contribute to the HSA until like 2027.

Using computational methods, we investigate a data set of 874,125 sentences from 30 U.S. history textbooks used in California and Texas schools to consider how they discuss Asians/Asian Americans. Only 1% of all sentences in our sample has any mention of Asians. Most of these sentences focus on Chinese and Japanese, and when individuals are named, they are usually White. The most prevalent topics in which Asians appear are about war. Discussions of wars are a centerpiece of history textbooks, but the dominance of such narratives is especially high for Asians relative to other ethno-cultural groups. The sentiment of verbs used to describe Asians is strikingly negative. Asians are described more negatively than others in both war and nonwar contexts.

Participants were quicker and more likely to choose the person rated as more attractive or strong when the difference between two individuals was more pronounced—but even slight differences influenced their choices and reaction times. These findings suggest that our minds are finely tuned to pick up on traits that may have influenced social and reproductive outcomes throughout human history.

Researchers at Charles University conducted the study to better understand how people judge physical characteristics that matter in social interactions, such as attractiveness and strength. While past studies have shown that people can identify traits like dominance or beauty from facial features alone, most of that research presented images one at a time or compared extremely different images—such as digitally altered faces made to look more masculine or feminine. The problem is that real-life social decisions rarely involve such dramatic contrasts. In everyday life, people usually compare individuals who fall along a continuum of similarity.

The study aimed to test whether people are equally good at detecting smaller, more natural differences between individuals. The researchers wanted to find out whether participants’ ability to make judgments improved in a gradual, step-by-step way as differences between people increased—or whether there was a threshold below which people could no longer reliably tell who was more attractive or formidable. If such a threshold existed, it would suggest that when two people look very similar, observers might have to guess. If, on the other hand, judgments improved steadily with increasing difference, this would indicate that human perception is finely attuned to even subtle variations.",2025-04-14 01:23:16,109,chrisdh79,science

Many illnesses within these categories can take a long time to be properly diagnosed. This study is looking at loneliness as a psychological predictor of a later medical diagnosis, but what proportion of the people studied had disease-specific symptoms before their diagnosis? 

>the onset of a medical condition was defined as the date of the first hospital diagnosis, the date of a repeated redeemed prescription, or the date of death with the medical condition stated as the underlying cause, whichever occurred first. 

Cardiovascular disease and dementias don’t begin as clinical entities at the time of diagnosis. They exist years, even decades *before* a diagnosis. 

Anyone who has dealt with a delayed diagnosis of a chronic condition can tell you how lonely it feels to have symptoms, but no answers; to be sick, but not have a name to call the sickness. 

As a personal “for instance,” I was diagnosed with migraines in my 30s, but I had been having migraines since I was a child. 

With respect to mental illness, loneliness and isolation (social withdrawal) could also be part of a prodrome of mental illness rather than an independent factor that contributes to risk of the illness 

I don’t want to suggest that loneliness is not an independent predictor in illness at all, but the relationship between loneliness and a medical condition is a lot more complicated than this study can show. ",2025-04-06 15:07:02,69,Potential_Being_7226,science

People with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms often have trouble communicating and resolving relationship difficulties with their romantic partners, according to previous research by Steffany Fredman, associate professor of human development and family studies at Penn State, and others. In a new study, Fredman and others have found that some of these problems may stem from people’s fear of their emotions.

Results published in Behaviour Research and Therapy demonstrated that people with higher levels of PTSD symptoms experienced greater fear of their emotions, which was associated with less constructive communication and more unproductive communication with their partners.",2025-04-01 12:05:35,61,mvea,science

mkuserv,1jotv2v,reddit,"I dated a woman who was diagnosed with PTSD and ADHD after we had been dating for 6 months and we were in love.  The relationship was a communication roller coaster. We would be deeply connected for a few weeks and then one seemingly harmless comment from me about something would set her off. She would fight with me for three days and I couldn’t understand why she was so upset. 

She was diagnosed at the tail end of our relationship and the diagnoses explained so much of what was happening with us. Unfortunately, she still ended things with me - saying she couldn’t trust me. Even though I spent so much time and effort showing up for her and giving to her it was not enough. 

Anyway, I am sorry for people who live with these conditions. But, the partners in these relationships also get put through the wringer if the partner with the mental health condition or neurodivergent brain is not managing themselves. I also dated people with depression and anxiety as well as another very long term relationship with someone who has ADHD.  In all of those cases, the relationship was severely impacted by the people who were not managing themselves and their conditions and relying on me to do so much of the work.

And for my anecdotal experience this creates a painful isolation.

A recent study published in the journal Personal Relationships found that people who believe in soulmates are more likely to engage in post-breakup contact and tracking behaviors—such as calling, messaging, or monitoring an ex online—especially when they see the former partner as an ideal match. In contrast, those who believe relationships succeed through effort and growth showed less inclination toward these behaviors. The research, which combined results from four studies, suggests that beliefs about romantic destiny may shape how people cope with heartbreak, and that targeting these beliefs could help reduce distress after a breakup.

Across all four studies, one consistent pattern did emerge: people who believe that relationships are predestined and that some partners are simply “meant to be” are more likely to struggle with letting go. They may be more prone to seek contact, track their ex’s behavior, or try to revive the connection—even when the relationship is over. On the other hand, people who believe that relationships grow through shared effort may be better able to accept a breakup and move on, recognizing that a failed relationship does not necessarily mean personal failure or lost fate.",2025-04-17 21:12:36,5,mvea,science

Exercise as an anti-ageing intervention to avoid detrimental impact of mental fatigue

Retired adults who habitually exercised outperformed sedentary adults in physical and cognitive tests.

Retired people who habitually exercise are more able to fight the impacts of mental fatigue, new research suggests.

In a paper published in the Journal of Aging and Physical Activity, a team of researchers from the University of Birmingham and the University of Extremadura in Spain worked with groups of adults to find out whether age would increase, and regular exercise would decrease the impact of mental fatigue on a series of cognitive and physical performance tests.

In the first study, sedentary men between 65 and 79 performed worse in cognitive and physical tests compared to 52-64 year olds, with these impairments greater when they were tested in a state of mental fatigue.

A second study with retired men and women aged 66-72 found that performance when mentally rested and fatigued was better in the physically active older adults than their sedentary peers.",2025-04-04 12:22:22,16,mvea,science

https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15298868.2025.2467733

Abstract

If agnostics are hesitant nonbelievers, are they characterized by (1) some emotional instability and indecisiveness, (2) a tendency to maximize in decision-making, or (3) low self-enhancement preventing them from thinking they are better than others? Data were collected online (through Prolific) from 333 UK adults who self-identified as Christian, agnostic, or atheist. We measured neuroticism, positive and negative affect, indecisiveness, maximization (four facets), the better-than-average effect (four domains), and spirituality. Analyses included between-group comparisons, multiple regressions, and distinct by group correlations of the psychological variables with the strength of self-identification as Christian, agnostic, or atheist. Agnostics were the highest of the three groups in neuroticism, indecisiveness, and maximization as a search for life alternatives, whereas strong atheist identifiers were low on the latter two dimensions. Indecisiveness uniquely predicted being agnostic versus atheist or religionist, beyond the role of spiritual inclinations, religious socialization, gender, and age (Wald statistic = 4.52, p = .034). Finally, high Christian identifiers tended to self-enhance on prosociality and niceness and high atheist identifiers self-enhanced on cleverness, but high agnostic identifiers evaluated both themselves and others as nice. This work suggests that agnostics may have their own motives not to join atheists.

From the linked article: 

Agnostics are more indecisive, neurotic, and prone to maximizing choices, distinguishing them from atheists and Christians

A new study published in Self & Identity reveals that agnosticism represents more than mere hesitation between belief and disbelief. Research findings indicate agnostics possess a distinct psychological profile characterized by higher indecisiveness, greater neuroticism, and a stronger tendency to search for alternatives in life compared to both atheists and religious believers.

As secularization increases globally, understanding the psychological foundations of nonbelief becomes increasingly important. Previous research has primarily focused on religious belief and its variations, but emerging evidence suggests nonbelief also manifests in different psychological profiles. Atheists and agnostics, who together constitute a significant proportion of nonbelievers in both the U.S. and Europe, have often been treated as a homogeneous group. Yet earlier studies have indicated that agnostics differ from atheists in being more open-minded, ambivalent, and prosocial. These differences raise a deeper question: are agnostics merely less decisive atheists, or do they represent a unique type of nonbelief?

The results revealed a compelling psychological portrait of agnostics. They scored significantly higher on neuroticism and indecisiveness than both Christians and atheists, while reporting lower positive affect than Christians. Agnostics exhibited a greater tendency to search for life alternatives, suggesting they maintain a broader orientation toward keeping options open rather than simply being uncertain atheists.

Indecisiveness emerged as the most robust predictor of agnosticism, uniquely and significantly predicting agnostic identification (versus atheist) even after controlling for spirituality, religious upbringing, gender, and age. When comparing agnostics to those with firm worldviews (both atheists and Christians combined), indecisiveness again stood out as a unique predictor. This suggests agnosticism may be driven not only by spiritual openness but also by a cognitive and emotional style that resists definitive conclusions.

The study also revealed intriguing differences in self-perception. While Christians tended to rate themselves more positively on prosocial traits and atheists on intelligence-related traits (both aligning with each group’s values), agnostics showed a more balanced evaluation of themselves and others. Strong agnostic identifiers rated both themselves and others positively on traits associated with being a “nice person” without exhibiting the “better-than-average effect” seen in the other groups. This pattern may reflect a form of humility or reluctance to assert superiority consistent with the agnostic worldview.

Another interesting finding was that agnostics’ strength of convictional identity wasn’t significantly correlated with any psychological traits, whereas clear associations emerged for Christians (e.g., lower neuroticism) and atheists (e.g., lower indecisiveness and negative affect). This reinforces the view that agnosticism may function less as a fixed identity and more as a fluid, exploratory stance toward existential questions.",2025-04-11 18:43:08,1,mvea,science

A new study published in Chronobiology International has found that caffeinated coffee improves physical performance in trained male athletes, regardless of whether they are morning or evening types. The research showed that caffeine enhanced grip strength, back strength, and sprint performance at both morning and evening testing times. However, caffeine had no significant effect on cognitive performance or perceived exertion.

The researchers found that caffeinated coffee significantly improved handgrip strength, back strength, and performance in the Wingate sprint test. These improvements were evident regardless of chronotype or time of day, although some nuanced differences emerged. For example, morning types performed significantly better after consuming caffeinated coffee in the morning compared to the evening. Similarly, evening types showed better grip strength in the evening following caffeine intake than they did in the morning.

In terms of peak power output on the sprint test, both chronotype groups experienced marked improvements with caffeine. Morning types in particular showed strong gains whether tested in the morning or evening. For average power output, morning types again showed enhanced performance with caffeine, with the greatest improvements occurring during evening testing.",2025-04-16 20:39:42,10,mvea,science

They were asked to imagine situations where a mutual friend had plans and to report either how likely they would be to ask to join or how they would feel if someone else asked to join them.

Who exactly is being imagined in these hypothetical scenarios? How do we know the people being thought of as ""mutual friends"" are actually mutual friends? 

Like, if I really like someone and they really like me then it would make sense to me that we would want each other's attention, and perhaps hesitate to *ask* for that attention so as not to put too much pressure on that liked person.

mmddeih,1jvvnds,reddit,"From the article: A recent study [published](https://doi.org/10.1177/01461672251324232) in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin sheds light on a common but often misunderstood social scenario: the hesitation many people feel when considering whether to ask to join the plans of others. Across eight studies, researchers found that people frequently underestimate how welcome their self-invitations would be. As a result, they miss out on social opportunities that the original planners would have happily included them in.

The research was inspired by a simple question: Why do people hesitate to ask if they can tag along when friends mention plans? For example, when someone casually brings up going to a festival or a movie, their friend may want to join but hold back, unsure whether they’d be seen as intrusive. Lead author Julian Givi, an associate professor at West Virginia University’s John Chambers College of Business and Economics, became interested in the topic after working on a related study about how people feel when their invitations are declined. That earlier project sparked curiosity about the flip side—what happens when someone wants to join plans but hesitates to ask.

The idea of self-inviting—when someone asks to join plans rather than being directly invited—is widely understood in everyday life, but it had received little scientific attention. Givi and his colleagues set out to explore whether people are as likely to ask to join others as those with the plans would actually want.

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878929325000015

Abstract

In response to Covid-19, western governments introduced policies that likely resulted in a reduced variety of facial input. This study investigated how this affected neural representations of face processing: speed of face processing; face categorization (differentiating faces from houses); and emotional face processing (differentiating happy, fearful, and neutral expressions), in infants (five or ten months old) and children (three years old). We compared participants tested before (total N = 462) versus during (total N = 473) the pandemic-related policies, and used electroencephalography to record brain activity. Event Related Potentials showed faster face processing in three-year-olds but not in infants during the policies. However, there were no meaningful differences between the two Covid-groups regarding face categorization, indicating that this fundamental process is resilient despite the reduced variety of input. In contrast, the processing of facial emotions was affected: across ages, while pre-pandemic children showed differential activity, during-pandemic children did not neurocognitively differentiate between happy and fearful expressions. This effect was primarily attributed to a reduced amplitude in response to happy faces. Given that these findings were present only in the later neural components (P400 and Nc), this suggests that post-pandemic children have a reduced familiarity or attention towards happy facial expressions.

From the linked article: 

Pandemic-era children show altered brain responses to facial expressions, new study finds

A large study published in Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience has found that children who were tested during the COVID-19 pandemic showed measurable differences in how their brains processed faces, especially emotional expressions. While some aspects of face perception remained stable, the research found that three-year-olds processed faces faster and, across all age groups, children had reduced neural responses to happy faces, suggesting changes in how familiar or attention-grabbing these expressions were.

When it came to how quickly the brain responded to faces, the researchers found no meaningful differences in 5- or 10-month-old infants between those tested before and during the pandemic. However, in three-year-olds, there was a notable difference. Children tested during the pandemic showed earlier N290 responses to faces than their pre-pandemic counterparts, indicating faster neural processing of facial information. This was specific to faces and not observed when children looked at images of houses.

The finding of faster face processing was somewhat unexpected. In typical development, the speed at which the brain processes faces increases with age and experience. However, some previous research in adults has shown that reduced facial information — such as when faces are masked — can lead to quicker processing.

However, the most striking differences emerged when the researchers examined how children responded to emotional expressions. Children tested before the pandemic showed distinct patterns of brain activity when viewing happy, fearful, and neutral faces. But among those tested during the pandemic, this differentiation was reduced or absent.

In both ten-month-olds and three-year-olds, brain responses to happy and fearful faces became less distinguishable, especially in the later ERP components, the P400 and Nc, which are thought to reflect attention or familiarity.

These differences were particularly driven by a reduced neural response to happy faces. While children in the pre-pandemic group showed stronger brain responses to happy expressions, those tested during the pandemic had weaker responses. This pattern suggests that happy faces were either less familiar or attracted less attention in the post-pandemic group.

The researchers propose several possible explanations. One is that the variety of happy expressions that children saw may have decreased during the pandemic, due to both mask-wearing and the emotional toll experienced by caregivers.",2025-04-05 16:46:22,9,mvea,science

Abstract

The evidence for the effects of early childhood education on risky behavior in adolescence is limited. This paper studies the consequences of an expansion of a universal preschool program in Japan. Exploiting regional differences in the program expansion, we estimate the policy effects using an event study model. Our estimates indicate that the preschool expansion significantly reduced juvenile violent arrests and the rate of teenage pregnancy, but did not increase high school enrollment or college enrollment rates. We suspect that improved non-cognitive skills can account for the reduction of risky behavior in adolescence.

Now, as an adult, I can definitely see how those early lessons shaped my behavior as a teen. I was less likely to lash out in stressful situations and more focused on finding solutions with my friends instead of letting conflicts escalate. I wonder if a lot of the issues teens face today might be different if more schools incorporated these kinds of practices into their curriculum at an early age.

I also think this is why I’ve seen such a difference between the way kids are raised in different cultures. I’ve visited Japan a few times, and what stood out to me was how polite and composed the younger generation is, even when things get tough. It’s not that they don’t deal with stress, but the way they’ve been taught to handle emotions from a young age is really noticeable. I’ve always thought there was something to how early education can help shape not just academic skills, but social and emotional ones too.

Key Points

Question  Is cannabis associated with the same midbrain dopamine pathway involved in psychosis?

Findings  In this cohort study including 61 individuals, participants with cannabis use disorder exhibited increased neuromelanin–magnetic resonance imaging signals in specific voxels of the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA). This subregion has previously shown elevated signals associated with untreated psychotic symptoms.

Meaning  Increased dopamine functioning in the SN/VTA may be associated with the risk of psychosis in people with cannabis use disorder.
Abstract

Importance  Despite evidence that individuals with a cannabis use disorder (CUD) are at elevated risk of psychosis and that the neurotransmitter dopamine has a role in psychosis, the mechanism linking cannabis use and psychosis remains unclear.",2025-04-10 10:29:20,20,yewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww,science

New study reveals potential biological link between cannabis use and psychosis

Researchers discover regular cannabis use is linked to signs of increased dopamine levels in the brain, a key factor in psychosis

Although it’s been six years since cannabis was legalized in Canada, further research is needed to fully understand its health effects.

A new study published today in JAMA Psychiatry sheds light on how cannabis use disorder is linked to changes in the brain that are associated with psychosis. Using brain imaging techniques, researchers found individuals with cannabis use disorder, those who were using cannabis on a frequent basis over an extended period of time, exhibited signs of higher levels of dopamine in the same region of the brain that is tied to psychosis. This study was conducted in London, Ont., led by researchers from London Health Sciences Centre Research Institute (LHSCRI) and Western University’s Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry.

“We now have evidence that shows a straight line linking cannabis with dopamine and psychosis that has never been shown before, and it’s crucial that clinicians, patients, and families work together to break this line,” said Lena Palaniyappan, adjunct professor at Schulich Medicine & Dentistry, former medical director for LHSC’s Prevention and Early Intervention Program for Psychosis (PEPP) and the senior author of the study.",2025-04-10 10:03:56,6,mvea,science

https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychiatry/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1548273/full

Results: A one-hour increase of screen time after going to bed was associated with 59% higher odds of having symptoms of insomnia and a reduction in sleep duration of 24 minutes. The associations between screen time and sleep outcomes did not differ for social media use versus other activities. Independent of screen time, participants who exclusively used social media had lower odds of insomnia and longer sleep duration compared to those engaging in other activities or a mix of activities.

Discussion: The present study found that increased screen time in bed is linked to poorer sleep, across activity type. Future research should refine classifications, assess specific content, and employ experimental approaches to determine causal mechanisms.

From the linked article: 

While it may seem obvious, your bedtime wind-down ritual might be costing you sleep

The researchers found that an hour of phone use in bed increases risk of insomnia by 59% and shaves 24 minutes off your night's sleep. And while the study was on older university students aged 18-28, social media was not the driving force - any phone use had the same impact.

“The type of screen activity does not appear to matter as much as the overall time spent using screens in bed,” said Dr. Gunnhild Johnsen Hjetland of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, and the study's lead author. “We found no significant differences between social media and other screen activities, suggesting that screen use itself is the key factor in sleep disruption – likely due to time displacement, where screen use delays sleep by taking up time that would otherwise be spent resting.”",2025-03-31 12:36:36,3,mvea,science

While this might be true some people, it's not true for most people.

When exposed to just natural light night owls go to sleep earlier more in line with early birds.

>Furthermore, we find that after exposure to only natural light, the internal circadian clock synchronizes to solar time such that the beginning of the internal biological night occurs at sunset and the end of the internal biological night occurs before wake time just after sunrise. In addition, we find that later chronotypes show larger circadian advances when exposed to only natural light, making the timing of their internal clocks in relation to the light-dark cycle more similar to earlier chronotypes.

Night owls generally have worse health habits, worse sleep habits, and less self control.

Studies also suggest that it's not your DNA keeping you up at 2am surfing TikTok but it's your lack of self control and your TikTok usage which is keeping you awake at 2am.

>The research showed that when teenagers and young adults experience a sense of failing to control their TikTok use, especially when it gets in the way of other responsibilities, they are significantly more likely to postpone going to bed.

Or people get convinced that they have some non 24-hour circadian rhythm. But studies suggest that all people when not exposed to daylight, have a non 24-hour circadian rhythm. So it's not that they are unique, it's just they don't engage in syncing behaviours like light exposure, regular patterns which means their circadian rhythm doesn't sync to 24 hours.",2025-03-31 16:24:02,-6,InTheEndEntropyWins,science

molmmo2,1k5ydz2,reddit,"From the article: 23 April 2025

Female lobbyists are more likely to gain access to meetings with policymakers, regardless of the policymaker’s gender, indicating gender is used strategically by interest groups to improve their influence, finds a new UCL led study.

For the study, published in Research & Politics, researchers from UCL Political Science, King’s College London, and Stockholm University analyzed the links between lobbyists’ access to legislators within the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union (EU).  

The [findings](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20531680251329005) showed that having a female lobbyist increases the likelihood of securing a meeting with a legislator by 35% compared to when the lobbyist is male.   

*Lead author, Professor David Coen (UCL Political Science) said: “Much attention has been paid to understanding gender inequality within government, but this study is the first comprehensive analysis of how gender effects lobbyists’ access to government, legislators, and policy makers”*

For the study, the researchers cross-referenced data from the EU’s Joint Transparency Register (the EU’s mandatory lobbying register) with a Transparency International dataset of over 4,000 meetings held between policymakers and interest groups in the European Commission between November 2014 and February 2021.  

They then analysed the individual characteristics of the lobbyists and the policymakers and used machine learning software to predict the individual’s gender based on their first name. The software draws on a database of first names and assigns a probability to its own prediction. 

The analysis also found that interest groups and policymakers have a notable mismatch in the supply and demand of gender diversity within their teams.  

For example, the interest groups tended to enlist their female lobbyists when targeting female policymakers, with female dominated EU departments twice as likely to be lobbied by a female lobbyist compared to a male dominated department. 

However, the policymakers were more receptive to female lobbyists regardless of their own gender representation.",2025-04-23 12:53:55,33,chrisdh79,science

There is basically no one with political access lobbying to improve the situation.

On another note, it's even less of a surprise to me that companies make use of that trend for their own benefit. The public falls for it too, not only politicians.

The authors also note that the fear response is mostly noticeable towards non-confirming boys, rather than girls. And that other emotions (disgust, anger,...) are no more present than with gender-conforming kids.

To me, this seems to suggest that boys internalise the fear of showing feminine traits at a very early stage. The remaining children's fear response might be out of empathy (""what will happen to this boy showing vulnerability?"") rather than fear for themselves.

Children learn from the people around them how to react to and treat other people.

It's the way we make girl related objects pink and boy ones blue or black. It's the way we call girls beautiful or pretty and boys are handsome. It permeates every aspect of our existence.

But it's a social construction that everyone plays into. These things haven't always been true though and they will change and shift over time.

Abstract

Prior studies suggested that children’s appraisals of gender-nonconforming, compared with gender-conforming, peers are less positive, particularly for gender-nonconforming boys. To gauge appraisals, most prior studies used verbal reports, which provide explicit measures. In contrast, the current study explored facial emotional expressions, which can potentially be an objective and implicit measure to inform the emotional component of appraisals. We examined 4-, 5-, 8-, and 9-year-olds in Hong Kong (n = 309) and Canada (n = 296) (N = 605; 303 boys, 302 girls). Children’s faces were video-recorded while viewing four vignettes of hypothetical gender-conforming and gender-nonconforming boy and girl targets in random order. Targets were shown as having gendered preferences in the domains of toys, activities, clothing and hairstyle, and playmates. FaceReader software was used to perform automated coding of six basic facial emotional expressions: angry, disgusted, happy, sad, scared, and surprised. Children showed more scared emotion toward the hypothetical gender-nonconforming boy target when compared with the gender-conforming boy target. Also, this elevation in scared emotion was correlated with children verbally reporting that they perceived the gender-nonconforming boy as being less happy relative to the gender-conforming boy. These results suggest that, during a brief initial exposure to a target peer, gender nonconformity in boy peers was related to a relatively heightened fear response in early and middle childhood. Further, facial emotional expressions can be used to gain insights regarding the emotional component of children’s appraisals of varying peer gender presentations, and these emotional responses can be associated with certain other aspects of their appraisals.

From the linked article: 

Children Show Fear Toward Peers Who Defy Gender Stereotypes

Summary: A new international study has revealed that children’s gender biases can be seen not only in what they say, but in how they express emotions on their faces. Researchers in Canada and Hong Kong studied over 600 children aged 4–9, analyzing facial expressions while they watched stories featuring gender-conforming and nonconforming peers.

The children showed significantly more fear when observing boys who displayed behaviors seen as feminine, such as liking dolls or wearing pink. These findings suggest children may internalize social norms early, potentially mimicking fear responses learned from family, peers, or media.

Key Facts:

Emotional Bias: Children displayed more fear when viewing boys who defied gender norms.

Cultural Consistency: Results were consistent across Canadian and Hong Kong participants.

Learning Pathways: The study suggests emotional responses to gender nonconformity may be learned socially.",2025-04-13 12:05:26,-3,mvea,science

I also remember a boy who was actually really cute and used to hang out with me and my female friends in high school and even though he was flirty no one felt nervous around him the way we might almost any other boy who was flirty (either out of fear of danger or because we liked him). No one wanted to date him either, even though we all thought he was cute. It just made sense that he would hang out with us and we felt safe around him.

mn1we8l,1jyxvia,reddit,">When an expansive curlicue of tissue sitting below the ovaries was discovered more than a century ago, it was dismissed as useless and erased from biology textbooks. Biologists now are taking a new look at the structure and its potential role.

>The *rete ovarii* seems to communicate with the ovary by directing a flow of protein-packed fluids through its long, tubular structure into the organ, researchers report March 19 in *eLife*. The results come amid recent reports suggesting that the “rediscovered” appendage may be responding to the body’s hormonal signals. While still a hypothesis, the finding indicates that this complex structure may [play a role in fertility and ovarian maintenance](https://elifesciences.org/articles/96662).

>When the structure was first identified in 1870, it had no obvious purpose, so scientists deemed it a functionless remnant of development. And it remained practically ignored for over a century, with researchers focusing on parts of the ovary already known to be biologically useful.

My theory: cholesterols (and fats in general) try to protect women's bodies from the effects of toxins by sequestering the toxins in tissue. The gall bladder is a bottle neck in this process, having originally functioned to help collect vitamins and nutrients from fats. The gall bladder, liver, and pancreas, get 'full' of manufacturing effluents like methylmercury, Strontium-90, and PFAS, begins the process of necrosis, and because the gall bladder does not heal itself as well as the liver, it is removed.

mmviz1s,1jy4ppd,reddit,"From the article: According to a [new study](https://academic.oup.com/ageing/article/54/4/afaf089/8108098), an older person who is concerned about having a fall is at a significantly higher risk of having a fall in the future. Researchers say that identifying and addressing this risk factor in older adults can help them stay mobile and independent for longer.

In 2015, the estimated cost to the US healthcare system of fatal and non-fatal falls was around US$50 billion. In our aging global population, reducing the number of falls among older adults is a high priority. That is why newly published international research into a particular fall risk factor is important.

Researchers from Australia, the UK, Germany and Canada undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies examining the association between older adults’ fear, or concerns, about falling and the incidence of future falls, and found a link.

“Concerns about falling are highly prevalent in older adults, affecting nearly one in two people by age 86,” said the study’s senior author, Professor Kim Delbaere, from the Falls, Balance and Injury Research Center, which is part of Neuroscience Research Australia (NeuRA). “They have been linked to reduced quality of life and independence, poor rehabilitation outcomes and increased risk of frailty, disability and admission to care homes.”",2025-04-13 10:35:04,6,chrisdh79,science

mofqm69,1k57sfx,reddit,"From the article: New research [published](https://doi.org/10.1177/01461672241313427) in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin suggests that people who recognize the fallibility of their beliefs may also be more accurate at interpreting others’ feelings. Across three studies, researchers found that intellectual humility was positively associated with empathic accuracy, particularly toward members of a perceived outgroup. The findings also suggest that intellectual humility can increase empathic concern without amplifying personal distress—a pattern the researchers call “empathic resilience.”

The study was motivated by growing interest in how intellectual humility—the ability to acknowledge that one’s beliefs may be wrong—shapes social behavior. While past research has shown that humility can reduce prejudice, increase forgiveness, and improve tolerance for different perspectives, less is known about how it influences interpersonal dynamics in emotionally charged or divisive contexts.

“Intellectual humility—the understanding that we don’t know everything and that our knowledge is limited—is an important and rare virtue,” said study author Michal Lehmann, a postdoctoral research associate at Carnegie Mellon University.

“In my research, I am interested in how relationships shape and are shaped by intellectual humility. In this project, I partnered with Prof. Anat Perry from the Hebrew University, her students Shir Genzer and Nur Kassem, and Prof. Daryl R. Van Tongeren from Hope College to uncover how and whether intellectual humility affects true understanding of other people’s emotions.”

“We tested this question in a particularly interesting context: how Jewish Israelis understand other Jewish Israelis and Palestinian Israelis.”

For their research, Lehmann and her colleagues conducted three pre-registered studies involving a total of 533 participants, all Jewish Israeli adults. The studies focused on cognitive empathy, or the ability to accurately identify what others are feeling, and emotional empathy, which includes both empathic concern and personal distress.",2025-04-22 14:33:31,48,chrisdh79,science

mk9wnwi,1jm7u87,reddit,"Paywalled, so I did some digging. At one point, about 15 years ago, I recall being told that 3 out of 4 patents filed in the U.S. were authored or co-authored by non-white or non-American contributors (this would include inventors that did not live in the U.S. and had no intent to immigrate). That figure may be apocryphal, though it was mentioned to me by a senior Partner I worked for as a paralegal (IP law). I also recall reading articles to the effect, though I'm having trouble tracking them down.

What gets more interesting is nearly three quarters of high quality patents are filed by inventors with a post-graduate degree. I bring that up because not only is the current administration attacking immigrants (and thereby likely scaling back the contribution of foreign born inventors), but domestic inventors are being hamstrung by the administration's cutting off funding to research institutes and, by extension, funding to post-grad candidates. We are doing terrible damage to our ability to keep up in a global competition that gains steam on a daily basis. In a sense, we may be watching ourselves committing slow motion national *sepukku*.

Abstract

We examined fear and disgust responses in trypophobia to distinguish between two hypotheses concerning the origin of this phenomenon. According to the hypothesis that trypophobia stems from an ancestral fear of dangerous animals, fear predominates over disgust, whereas the opposite is true according to the disease aversion hypothesis. Currently, the question of which of the two plays a more significant role in trypophobia remains unclear. Adults had to rate on Likert-type scales their level of disgust and fear when presented with photographs of frightening or disgusting stimuli, trypophobia-inducing stimuli, i.e., clusters of holes, or neutral stimuli. They also had to rate the difficulty of viewing these images. Higher levels of disgust than fear were found for the trypophobic images in both the overall sample and in the participants reporting the highest levels of discomfort when viewing them. Trypophobic images had a special status for these latter participants, as they were rated more disgusting than non-trypophobic disgusting images and more frightening than non-trypophobic frightening images. Although disgust is the dominant emotion in trypophobia, fear is also not negligible.

From the linked article: 

Trypophobia triggers stronger disgust than fear, new study shows

People who feel uncomfortable or even repulsed by clusters of small holes—such as those found in lotus seed pods or honeycombs—are more likely to feel disgust than fear when confronted with these images, according to a new study published in the Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology. The findings suggest that trypophobia, a phenomenon often described as a fear of holes, may be more accurately understood as a disgust-based response aimed at avoiding disease. However, fear also plays a role, particularly in individuals most sensitive to these images.

Across the full sample, trypophobic images were rated as more disgusting than frightening. While these images were not rated as disgusting as the explicitly disgusting ones, they still triggered more disgust than fear. This was true even though trypophobic images were also seen as more frightening than neutral images, showing that both emotions are present to some degree.

Interestingly, the participants who reported the most difficulty viewing the trypophobic images—those in the top 10 percent of discomfort ratings—showed a different pattern. For these individuals, trypophobic images were rated as more disgusting than even the disgust-inducing images, and more frightening than the frightening ones. In other words, for the people most sensitive to clusters of holes, trypophobic images were uniquely disturbing across both emotional dimensions.

Even among these highly sensitive participants, however, disgust remained the dominant emotion. This supports the idea that trypophobia is more closely linked to disease avoidance than to the fear of predators. These findings are consistent with previous work showing that people with high scores on the Trypophobia Questionnaire tend to report core and pathogen-related disgust more than moral or sexual disgust.

The results also help clarify why both fear and disgust can be part of the trypophobic experience. Disgust may serve to prevent contact with potential sources of infection—such as spoiled food or skin lesions—while fear may help initiate flight from a perceived threat. The fact that both emotions are activated could reflect how our minds respond to stimuli that might signal either kind of danger.",2025-04-11 14:03:31,17,mvea,science

Luckily, it's not all clusters of holes, but I don't know what will trigger it. Three particularly disturbing triggers were a picture of a hand with punctures or something, a video of a lot of mussels popping out of the sand when it was covered with seawater, and a photo of an apartment building in the US where the windows had these sort of lumpy arches above them.



Thinking back, I saw a video on the early internet of a hiker having some sort of large insects/larva pulled out of his calf with tweezers, one after the other. I didn't like it at all, but I watched it out of morbid curiosity. I'm pretty sure they were just trying to trick people online with practical effects, but it was pretty disgusting to watch anyway, and it has remained lodged in my memory since.

Superhelix flow structures drive sperm locomotion

Highlights

•	Sperm propulsion is driven by rolling superhelix flow structures acting like corkscrews

•	Dual-imaging microscopy resolves both sperm motion and its surrounding 3D hydrodynamic flow

•	Asymmetric flow structures rotate with sperm, enabling symmetric forward thrust

•	Sperm-generated flow follows a stresslet model, decaying as r−3 near surfaces

From the linked article: 

Sperm don’t just swim - they screw their way forward

Monash researchers have discovered that swimming sperm create swirling fluid vortices – shaped like rolling corkscrews – giving them an extra boost in the race to the egg. The study reveals that these vortices attach to the sperm cell and rotate in sync, adding extra spin that enhances propulsion and helps keep them on a direct path through the fluid.

This is the first time researchers have simultaneously captured both the flagellar motion and the surrounding 3D flow field, providing unprecedented insight into the mechanics of sperm propulsion.",2025-04-09 12:08:03,5,mvea,science

They argue that we can now assign monetary values to the damage caused by emissions that can be traced back to individual companies. They found that ""The global economy would be $28 trillion richer ... were it not for the extreme heat caused by the emissions from the 111 carbon majors.""
>
>They argue that this method might provide legal ammunition for those interested in seeking climate damages in court: ""By revealing the human fingerprint on events previously thought to be ‘acts of God,’ attribution science has helped make climate change legally legible.""

>
>The method used by Callahan and Mankin is a variant on standard climate attribution studies. In the standard studies, climate models are run with and without the carbon dioxide that humanity has pumped into the atmosphere through fossil fuels and land use changes. You can then compare the frequency of specific weather events, like the intensity of rainfall from a hurricane or the peak temperatures of a heatwave, both with and without the added CO2. The difference in frequency is an indication of the impact of climate change.

>...
>
>Callahan and Mankin directly relate this to potential legal liability, arguing that science has progressed to the point where it has something to say about potential liabilities. ""To sue over an injury, a litigant typically must demonstrate a causal connection between the action of the defendant and the plaintiff’s injury, sometimes through meeting a ‘but for’ standard: 'but for the actions of the defendant, the plaintiff would not have been injured.'” As they note, this matches up very well with the structure of their analysis, which compares the present climate to one that includes all the emissions ""but for"" the ones associated with specific companies.
>
>But they also note that we're still figuring out what legal standards should be applied, and who should be held liable. For example, a suit in Montana targeted the state for failing to provide its residents with a healthful environment. Other suits have targeted emissions as creating a public nuisance, or companies for misleading their investors by failing to account for climate-related risks. The liability that this study speaks to is not the only option for seeking legal redress.

Research Link: [Carbon majors and the scientific case for climate liability](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08751-3)

Abstract:

>Will it ever be possible to sue anyone for damaging the climate? Twenty years after this question was first posed, we argue that the scientific case for climate liability is closed. Here we detail the scientific and legal implications of an ‘end-to-end’ attribution that links fossil fuel producers to specific damages from warming. Using scope 1 and 3 emissions data from major fossil fuel companies, peer-reviewed attribution methods and advances in empirical climate economics, we illustrate the trillions in economic losses attributable to the extreme heat caused by emissions from individual companies. Emissions linked to Chevron, the highest-emitting investor-owned company in our data, for example, very likely caused between US $791 billion and $3.6 trillion in heat-related losses over the period 1991–2020, disproportionately harming the tropical regions least culpable for warming. More broadly, we outline a transparent, reproducible and flexible framework that formalizes how end-to-end attribution could inform litigation by assessing whose emissions are responsible and for which harms. Drawing quantitative linkages between individual emitters and particularized harms is now feasible, making science no longer an obstacle to the justiciability of climate liability claims.",2025-04-24 02:24:42,11,Hrmbee,science

mnzcta4,1k359it,reddit,"From the article: Many men underestimate how willing other men are to seek help for depression, which may discourage them from seeking help themselves, according to a new study [published](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11199-025-01574-6) in Sex Roles.

Despite the availability of mental health services, many people experiencing depression delay or avoid seeking help. Hege H. Bye and colleagues investigated whether one barrier might be a form of pluralistic ignorance, where individuals mistakenly believe that others in their group are less likely to seek help than they themselves are. Prior research suggests people often misjudge how others perceive mental illness, assuming stigma is more widespread than it is. These misperceptions can shape behavior and hinder treatment-seeking.

The researchers were particularly interested in how gender affects these misperceptions. Past studies have yielded mixed findings on whether men seek help less than women, but cultural stereotypes tend to portray men as less inclined to pursue psychological support.

The researchers conducted two preregistered experiments using large, population-based samples of Norwegian adults. Experiment 1 utilized a between-groups experimental design in which 2,042 participants were randomly assigned to read a vignette describing either a male (Kristian) or female (Kristine) character experiencing symptoms of depression. The vignettes were based on diagnostic criteria for a depressive episode from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) and adapted from prior research.",2025-04-19 20:17:07,31,chrisdh79,science

mkc0uft,1jmizxa,reddit,"From the article: A new study [published](https://doi.org/10.1177/02698811251324379) in the Journal of Psychopharmacology has found that cannabis use can impair key driving skills for up to five and a half hours after consumption—well beyond the commonly assumed three-hour window. The study also revealed that many users feel ready to drive long before their driving performance returns to normal.

The researchers were motivated by the rapid expansion of legal cannabis use across the United States and the rising number of car crashes involving drivers who test positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis. In 2021 alone, over 52 million Americans reported using cannabis. Yet existing research has not kept pace. Most past studies have only assessed driving within a narrow three-hour window after cannabis use, leaving questions about how long impairments might actually last. In addition, current laws in many states rely on THC blood levels to infer impairment, even though earlier findings have suggested that these levels may not accurately reflect a person’s ability to drive safely.

“With cannabis being the second most widely used recreational drug after alcohol, understanding its impact on driving behaviors is critical for public safety. Previous research on cannabis-impaired driving often focused on limited metrics and short timeframes, leaving gaps in knowledge about the duration and scope of impairment. Our interest was driven by the need to explore these gaps systematically, using a robust experimental design to assess multiple driving behaviors over extended periods,” explained study author Shashwath A.

From the linked article: 

Semaglutide Use Modestly Elevates Optic Neuropathy Risk in Patients With Diabetes

The researchers found that use of the glucagonlike peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) semaglutide is linked with a more than 4 times greater risk of NAION compared with non-GLP-1RAs. Researchers in the current study further evaluated that tie by analyzing data in several databases, aiming to determine whether risk of NAION is greater with semaglutide, other GLP-1RA, or non-GLP-1RA weight loss medications (empagliflozin, sitagliptin, and glipizide).

The researchers discovered that the incidence rate of NAION for new semaglutide recipients was 14.5 per 100,000 person-years based on the sensitive definition and 8.7 per 100,000 person-years based on the specific definition. The investigators found that incidence proportions for NAION among new semaglutide recipients were 7.1 per 100,000 persons for the sensitive definition and 4.2 per 100,000 persons for the specific definition.",2025-03-27 20:50:05,22,mvea,science

NAION has been described as nocturnal hypotensive optic neuropathy. 
Ozempic lowers blood pressure. 
The normal diurnal variation is for blood pressure to be reduced during sleep. 
Many people take their blood pressure medication at bedtime.
In addition, some people sleep with more than one pillow.
This combination could result in reduced blood pressure to the optic nerve,leading to NAION. Ozempic could cause just enough additional reduction in blood pressure in susceptible people to trigger NAION.",2025-03-28 13:01:25,8,phacotodd,science

Key Points

Question  Are LGBTQ+ inclusive hospital policies associated with nurse job outcomes and quality of care?

Findings  In this cross-sectional study of 7343 nurses from 111 hospitals, nurses in hospitals with high LGBTQ+ inclusion reported lower burnout, reduced job dissatisfaction, better care quality, and a greater willingness to recommend their hospitals.

Meaning  Hospitals should recognize that LGBTQ+ inclusive policies are not only about compliance or diversity but also crucial for improving work climate, staff well-being, and care delivery.

Abstract

Importance  Despite emphasis on the establishment of inclusive hospital policies, the impact of these policies on employees and organizations remains unknown.

Objective  To evaluate the association between inclusive policies for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, and other sexual and gender minority (LGBTQ+) and nurse job outcomes as well as nurse-reported quality of care.

Design, Setting, and Participants  This cross-sectional study analyzed 4 survey datasets from 2021: the RN4CAST-NY/IL, including registered nurses from New York and Illinois, and the Healthcare Equality Index (HEI) data. The HEI evaluates and scores US health care facilities that voluntarily participate based on their LGBTQ+ inclusivity in policies, such as nondiscrimination policies and LGBTQ+ inclusive clinical services. The study used American Hospital Association Annual Survey data for hospital characteristics and Magnet organization data to classify hospitals by Magnet status. Data analyses were performed in December 2024.

Main Outcomes and Measures  Nurse job outcomes included burnout and job dissatisfaction. Quality of care outcomes included nurses’ perceptions of care quality and their likelihood of recommending their hospital. The independent variable was LGBTQ+ Healthcare Equality Leader (HEI Leader) status, which signified hospitals with the highest levels of LGBTQ+ inclusion. Multilevel logistic regression models included nurse-level (age, race and ethnicity, gender, and years of experience at the current hospital) and hospital-level (Magnet status, size, teaching status, specialized service capability, and ownership) covariates.

Results  A total of 7343 nurses (mean [SD] age, 44.9 [13.4] years; 6584 [89.6%] women) from 111 hospitals were included in the study. Nurses in hospitals with HEI Leader status had lower odds of high burnout (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.69; 95% CI, 0.52-0.92) and lower odds of job dissatisfaction (AOR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.45-0.86) compared with those in hospitals without the status. They also had higher odds of reporting excellent or good quality of care (AOR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.23-2.73) and higher odds of recommending their hospital (AOR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.19-2.50).

Conclusions and Relevance  In this cross-sectional study, nurses in hospitals with high LGBTQ+ inclusion reported more favorable job outcomes and care quality. Hospitals should understand that implementing LGBTQ+ inclusive policies goes beyond compliance or diversity; it is essential for improving the work climate, enhancing staff well-being, and optimizing care delivery.",2025-03-26 11:31:04,10,mvea,science

mlv5ji9,1jtlywa,reddit,"From the article: A neuroimaging study of action video game players revealed that these individuals tend to have enhanced functional and structural connectivity in the dorsal visual stream of the brain. More specifically, they exhibited heightened functional connectivity between the left superior occipital gyrus and the left superior parietal lobule. The research was [published](https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci14121206) in Brain Sciences.

The human brain has two distinct pathways for processing visual information: the dorsal and ventral streams. The dorsal stream, often referred to as the “where” pathway, originates in the primary visual cortex and extends toward the parietal lobe. It is primarily involved in processing the spatial location and movement of objects, helping to guide movements in relation to those objects.

In contrast, the ventral stream—known as the “what” pathway—extends from the primary visual cortex to the temporal lobe. This pathway is essential for recognizing and identifying objects, including their details and colors. Together, the dorsal and ventral streams enable the brain to integrate visual information into coherent perceptions and facilitate effective interaction with the environment by combining recognition and spatial awareness.",2025-04-07 14:07:16,179,chrisdh79,science

While this is anecdotal and only represents my own experience which may be more extreme than others, it seems to match the pattern discussed in this article. My wife and I met in grad school for public policy. Her parents hold opposing views to my own. Eventually her political beliefs realigned to be closer to my own and while I might have been part of that, her professional experience in politics was really the reason in my opinion.

I left that field but she has 20+ years experience. Despite that her parents still tell her she’s wrong about things even when it’s just regarding the mechanics of how the government works. It’s truly baffling. They would rather believe the talking heads that validate their extreme beliefs than their own daughter with an undergrad and grad degree, plus 20 years experience.

Persecution is used in theology, not in arithmetic, because in arithmetic there is knowledge, but in theology there is only opinion.

But actually, LLMs iteratively produce the next word in a paragraph, with the goal of making paragraphs that sound as similar as possible to the training data. The only way they store information is that if a statement is statistically common in the training data, the LLM will reproduce that statement statistically often. They do not distinguish between facts, opinions, biases, etc., so they reproduce statistically common biases.

The solution is not just to clean the data. No matter how well you clean data, minorities are just less statistically common and therefore ML models ""care"" less about them. It's still a better idea to improve how human medical professionals treat patients by reducing their biases.

Abstract

There are widespread concerns that conspiracy theories undermine democracies. But do conspiracy beliefs increase criticism of democracy and/or support for authoritarianism? Or are antidemocratic people more likely to endorse conspiracy beliefs? To answer these important questions, we collected longitudinal data during two concurrent democratic elections—the 2020 US Presidential Election (N = 609) and the 2020 General Election in New Zealand (N = 603). Random intercept cross-lagged panel models tested whether conspiracy beliefs affect criticism of democracy in general, as well as support for authoritarianism, and both direct and representative democracy, specifically. There was little evidence that conspiracy beliefs temporally preceded changes in attitudes toward democracy or support for any specific form of government. Instead, people who supported authoritarianism more subsequently endorsed stronger conspiracy beliefs. The results suggested that, in the context of electoral contests (e.g., elections), antidemocratic people are more likely to endorse conspiracy beliefs rather than conspiracy beliefs fostering antidemocratic views.

From the linked article: 

Authoritarian minds may be primed for conspiracy beliefs, study suggests

A new study published in Political Psychology challenges a widely held assumption about the relationship between conspiracy beliefs and democracy. The researchers found that, rather than conspiracy beliefs leading to criticism of democratic institutions or support for authoritarianism, it may be that people who already favor authoritarian forms of government are more likely to adopt conspiracy beliefs—especially during elections.

In the United States, the study found no strong evidence that belief in election conspiracy theories led to later increases in criticism of democracy or support for authoritarianism. Instead, the results suggested the opposite pattern: individuals who showed increased support for authoritarian government were more likely to adopt conspiracy beliefs later on.

In New Zealand, where election conspiracies were less widespread and the political climate was less polarized, the results were similarly revealing. There, people who generally supported authoritarianism or were critical of democracy also tended to endorse conspiracy theories about the election.

Interestingly, across both countries, conspiracy beliefs were associated with both support for authoritarianism and support for direct democracy. While these two systems are quite different—one centralizing power in a strong leader, the other distributing it among the people—the common thread appears to be dissatisfaction with the current representative system. People critical of the status quo may be drawn to alternative forms of governance, even if those alternatives are ideologically opposed.",2025-04-21 12:05:10,14,mvea,science

A (currently stayed) court ruling ending DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) could affect additional personnel, including some physicians and nurses.

Abstract

In 2022, the Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization Supreme Court decision removed federal constitutional protections for abortion.1 As states have adopted new abortion restrictions, 50% of reproductive-age women now live in states that ban or severely restrict abortion access.2 However, adolescents’ experiences have not been examined in detail. As the Dobbs decision exacerbates existing health and social inequalities, those implications will extend to adolescents who face disproportionate barriers to accessing abortion care, including transportation, finances, and potential parental involvement requirements.3 The aim of this study was to understand the scope of post-Dobbs abortion policy changes across states for this population overall and by racial and ethnic subgroups because abortion restrictions are expected to disproportionately impact historically marginalized groups.4

From the linked article: 

More than 7 million American adolescent girls ages 13 to 17 live in states with abortion bans, restrictive gestational limits or parental involvement requirements, according to Rutgers Health researchers.

Their study, published in JAMA Pediatrics, is the first to examine in detail the experiences of adolescent girls after states enacted restrictions on abortion access following the 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization Supreme Court decision.

Minors are often targeted by restrictive policies and less able to use routes to abortion care common for adults – traveling to another state or using telehealth – leaving them disproportionately impacted. Without access to abortion, these girls have lost the ability to control their lives and their futures.

“As a result of Dobbs, two-thirds of girls ages 13 to 17 now live in states that ban or severely restrict their abortion access,” said Laura Lindberg, a professor at the Rutgers School of Public Health and author of the study. “Minors are often targeted by restrictive policies and less able to use routes to abortion care common for adults – traveling to another state or using telehealth – leaving them disproportionately impacted. Without access to abortion, these girls have lost the ability to control their lives and their futures.”

As of December, 12 states have banned abortion entirely and 10 states have restrictive gestational limits. As of Sept. 1, 2023, parental involvement in a minor’s decision to have an abortion is required in the 10 states with restrictive gestational limits and 14 of 29 states (as well as Washington, D.C.) without bans or without restrictive gestational limits.

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2833030

Introduction

In the 2 years since the US Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization (2022) (Dobbs) overturned the constitutional right to abortion, 14 states have enforced bans on nearly all abortions, 6 states have enforced bans on abortions after 6 to 12 weeks’ gestation, and the future legality of abortion remains uncertain in several additional states where litigation and ballot initiatives are developing.

From the linked article: 

Three years after the U.S. Supreme Court ended the federal right to abortion, doctors who specialize in obstetrics and gynecology are still dealing with tough decisions about where to live and work.

A new study published in JAMA Network Open shows that most OB/GYNS didn't immediately leave states where abortion was banned after the 2022 Dobbs ruling.

In fact, the number of OB/GYNS in those states rose by about 8% in the months after the decision, similar to the growth in states where abortion remains legal.

But doctors say their decisions are personal and pretty complex, CNN reported.

While most OB/GYNs haven't moved, some say the legal risks have changed how they practice.

""Doctors are definitely very uncomfortable, very scared. They're doing a lot of things differently. They're punting a lot of things that they could have handled before to other people who are more comfortable taking on that sort of risk or the intensity,"" Freedman said.",2025-04-24 02:12:05,7,mvea,science

I'll take the time and elaborate a bit more on my hot take. That's what it is ofcourse. I more intent to get people to consider a world most aren't even able to contemplate. So ingrained is advertisement in our lives.

Consider the amount to time and mental capacity that is taken from people every time they (are forced to) watch an ad. That time could be spend differently.

Consider the enormous industry that churns out these ads. Those people could contribute with real value. They could be producing art for all I care.

Consider the blight on the physical space that advertisements take in our (urban) environment. And people complain about windmills in their backyard.

There are many reasons why our products are of worse quality but one reason is that corporation dont have to rely on an product to build a brand for them, but they can just throw ads at it.

What about social media ecosystem? One of the main reasons divisive content is consistently promoted is that their business drive on user engagement to .. sell ads. Turns out the more controversial content drives that best.
Perhaps we don't need free products that also set up our society to live on completely different realities from eachother.

mlkqmtm,1js0lgu,reddit,"The article taps into a common tension—people want protection (especially for kids) but often frame responsibility in binary terms: either the government fixes it or it's up to parents.


But the truth is messier. Responsibility is shared and layered, not mutually exclusive. The challenge is that:


Systems (marketing, regulation, tech) are complex and hard for individuals to control.


Personal responsibility is necessary, but it doesn’t stand up well against billion-dollar ad strategies.


People often default to “someone else should fix it” when the problem feels overwhelming.

Placing full responsibility on the government can oversimplify the issue. Food companies, advertisers, digital platforms, schools, and  ESPECIALLY the parents all play a role.

Parents should carry significant but not exclusive responsibility. Their role is foundational—they set the tone for food expectations, model behaviour, and create the home food environment. That said, their influence is undermined when:


A. Marketing is constant and insidious (especially online).


B. Unhealthy options are cheap, accessible, and heavily promoted.


C. Children are targeted in ways parents can't easily monitor.


The focus imo should be split four ways:


1. Government: Stronger regulation of marketing standards.


2. Industry: Responsible self-regulation and transparency.


3. Platforms: Limiting ad targeting toward children.


4. Parents: Media awareness / literacy and dietary guidance at home. Basically teaching kids to think and eat smart, not just obey rules, and helping kids recognise and think critically about ads—for example, teaching them:
* What advertising is and how it tries to influence choices.
* That not everything in ads is true or healthy.
* To question why certain foods are made to look fun or cool.

Patents bed to be ultimately responsible for providing the mostly healthy food options at home and for talking about nutrition in simple, positive ways (e.g. “this helps your brain grow”).

mlirrqg,1js0lgu,reddit," More than 4 in 5 parents concerned about junk food marketing

Public health experts are calling for the next Federal Government to take action to stop junk food ads targeting children, after new research showed that the issue is a concern for 85% of caregivers.

The new study of almost 4,000 adults, led by Deakin University and published in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health, alsoshowed that there was a high level of support amongst Australian adults for Government initiatives that would help protect children from unhealthy food marketing.

Lead author Clara Gomez-Donoso from the Global Centre for Preventive Health and Nutrition, Institute for Health Transformation, Deakin University, says that the research provides a clear picture of Australians' support for restricting unhealthy food marketing across diverse media and settings.

“More than 60 percent of Australian adults support a ban on the marketing of unhealthy food and beverages to children. Banning unhealthy food advertising on TV before 9pm and removing child-appealing marketing elements like cartoons from unhealthy food packaging are also popular policies, supported by more than half of respondents.”

Senior author Professor Kathryn Backholer, from Deakin University and Vice President, Policy at the Public Health Association of Australia, says that the study shows that parents have the same fears as public health experts when it comes to the way junk food companies target children.

“The results show that Australians are concerned about the current situation when it comes to junk food advertising in Australia – and rightly so. Our children can’t walk to school, go to the shops or sit down and watch TV without being bombarded with unhealthy food advertising and it’s affecting their health. Childhood obesity rates are increasingly, while preventable disease in our community continues to grow.”

Adj Prof Terry Slevin, CEO, Public Health Association of Australia, says that the publication of peer-reviewed academic research showing that Australian parents are concerned about junk food advertising to children should prompt all candidates to consider their position ahead of the 3 May federal election.

“Obesity in Australia is a public health ticking timebomb and a huge challenge for our nation. It has recently overtaken tobacco as our biggest cause of preventable disease burden.

mosh6cv,1k6idyc,reddit,"**Plain-English Summary:**

Scientists have long wondered how the Earth's thick, light-colored continental crust (made of ""felsic"" rocks like granite) forms from the darker, heavier material in the Earth's mantle (called ""mafic"" rocks like basalt). One leading idea is that the heavier parts of the Earth's outer shell (the *lithosphere*) sink back down into the deeper mantle — a process called *foundering*.

A great example of where this may be happening is in the Sierra Nevada mountains in California, which were formed by an old chain of volcanoes. In this study, researchers used a method called *receiver functions* (a way of analyzing earthquake waves to see underground structures) to detect a layer below the crust that shows signs of movement or *shear*.

The direction of this underground movement suggests that chunks of the Earth's lithosphere have been peeling away and sinking westward or southwestward. This sinking process seems to have already finished in the southern Sierra Nevada — where the signs are strongest and shallower — but is still happening in the central Sierra, where it shows up deeper underground and lines up with earthquake activity that happens unusually deep (over 40 kilometers).

These findings give us a kind of ""time-lapse"" view of how this process unfolds over millions of years and across hundreds of kilometers — helping us understand how continents get built and shaped over geological time.",2025-04-24 14:04:15,85,Lethargic_Unicorn,science

From the linked article: 

Benefits of ADHD medication outweigh health risks, study finds

Children taking ADHD drugs showed small increases in blood pressure and pulse rates but ‘risk-benefit ratio is reassuring’

The benefits of taking drugs for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder outweigh the impact of increases in blood pressure and heart rate, according to a new study.

An international team of researchers led by scientists from the University of Southampton found the majority of children taking ADHD medication experienced small increases in blood pressure and pulse rates, but that the drugs had “overall small effects”. They said the study’s findings highlighted the need for “careful monitoring”.

Prof Samuele Cortese, the senior lead author of the study, from the University of Southampton, said the risks and benefits of taking any medication had to be assessed together, but for ADHD drugs the risk-benefit ratio was “reassuring”.

“We found an overall small increase in blood pressure and pulse for the majority of children taking ADHD medications,” he said. “Other studies show clear benefits in terms of reductions in mortality risk and improvement in academic functions, as well as a small increased risk of hypertension, but not other cardiovascular diseases. Overall, the risk-benefit ratio is reassuring for people taking ADHD medications.”",2025-04-07 04:01:40,1,mvea,science
mltbu1v,1jtcim9,reddit,"Just want to point out the title of the article is a bit misleading. This study was specifically about the cardiovascular effects of ADHD meds rather than overall safety.

Anecdotally, when I took meds the sensation is similar to a high caffeine dose, which is widely regarded to be safe for general use from a cardiovascular standpoint. I think many of the concerns around ADHD meds from myself and others are around the psychological and nutritional impact of prolonged stimulant use.

It's also worth noting that none of the studies this study cites are over a period longer than 1 year, and over 70% of the participants were white males, so the data is heavily skewed demographically.",2025-04-07 04:34:08,161,DislikesUSGovernment,science

They created three scenarios that were similar in one key aspect: In each instance, subjects were able to earn a bonus payment by giving a certain response, knowing that experimenters would not be able to trace whether their response actually represented the truth. That said, researchers were able to estimate the relation between someone’s tendency to lie and their self-reported personality traits.

>What did they learn? In all three situations, significantly more people claimed a win than was to be expected if everyone had been honest. Even more importantly: “Being dishonest in one situation makes it likely that someone will also act dishonestly in other, similar situations”, Thielmann sums up. She sees this as counter-evidence to the prevailing assumption that lying varies notably depending on the situation.

>In addition, the researchers were able to identify yet another association, i.e., that persons with certain personality traits—such as honesty-humility—are far less likely to lie repeatedly.

This model includes: emotionality (E), extraversion (X), agreeableness (A), conscientiousness (C) and openness to experience (O).

9 Basic Elements in the Chemistry of Romantic Attraction

New research identifies the 9 elements that can ignite romantic chemistry.

KEY POINTS

- Romantic chemistry is a term everyone uses, but there is little research on what it means.

- A new study asks people to define romantic chemistry in their own terms, leading to 9 unique elements.

- By understanding that romantic chemistry may change, its powerful effect on your fulfillment can blossom.

The resulting nine categories are as follows, with brief descriptions and examples; frequencies are indicated in parentheses:

Positive interaction (64%)

This, the most frequent category, included positive feelings, sense of connection or attraction, and enjoyment of time together: “You have an emotional connection with them.”

Mutuality (48%)

Feelings of mutuality included reciprocity and responsiveness: “Having chemistry means you both have a mutual interest in each other.”

Comfort (41%)

Feeling at ease and authentic; finding it easy to communicate; not feeling negative: “You are not afraid to share the innermost parts of yourself.”

Compatibility (40%)

Feelings of togetherness: “It means we match with each other really, really well…”

Similarity (36%)

Feeling alike to a partner: “They think alike, act alike, and share a lot of common interests.”

Unexplainable spark (31%)

Magical or unexplainable aspects: “It means the other person has the same vibrational energies as you do…”

Sexual attraction (28%)

Sexual/physical descriptors or attraction: “If a couple both have the same wants and desires when it comes to intimacy.”

Intense fixation (24%)

Feelings of intense focus with each other: “We want to be with each other all the time...”

Physiological response (6%)

Bodily sensations felt around partner: “…it feels like butterflies in your stomach…”

The nine elements also corresponded in part to the ICM, which the authors note, as “dyadic and transactional,” with six elements fitting into its themes. 

To sum up, finding a partner with whom you have chemistry seems to bring with it many potentially rewarding features. Comfort, ease, and those magical elements of being with that other person form an important part of the equation for long-term fulfillment.",2025-04-20 19:18:29,17,mvea,science

at one point I legit was in such a state of depression I figured going to the hospital and telling the nurse I wanted to blow my brains out would be the only way people would hear me and take me seriously. 

luckily after years of self growth I can say I am no longer in a horrible mental state and have come a long way but I can definitely say that had I seen someone earlier I would have been better off.

From the linked article: 

A global study by experts at the University of Sydney has shown that countries which consume more plant-based proteins – such as chickpeas, tofu and peas – have longer adult life expectancies.

Published in Nature Communications, Dr Alistair Senior, PhD candidate Caitlin Andrews and their team in the Charles Perkins Centre studied food supply and demographic data between 1961-2018 from 101 countries, with the data corrected to account for population size and wealth, to understand whether the type of protein a population consumed had an impact on longevity.

“For the under-fives, a food system that supplies large amounts of animal-based proteins and fats – such as meat, eggs and dairy – lowered rates of infant mortality. However, for adults, the reverse was true, where plant-based proteins increased overall life expectancy.”",2025-04-16 20:56:27,21,mvea,science

Research journal link: [Crows recognize geometric regularity](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adt3718)

Abstract:

>The perception of geometric regularity in shapes, a form of elementary Euclidean geometry, is a fundamental mathematical intuition in humans. We demonstrate this geometric understanding in an animal, the carrion crow. Crows were trained to detect a visually distinct intruder shape among six concurrent arbitrary shapes. The crows were able to immediately apply this intruder concept to quadrilaterals, identifying the one that exhibited differing geometric properties compared to the others in the set. The crows exhibited a geometric regularity effect, showing better performance with shapes featuring right angles, parallel lines, or symmetry over more irregular shapes. This performance advantage did not require learning. Our findings suggest that geometric intuitions are not specific to humans but are deeply rooted in biological evolution.",2025-04-12 21:26:01,62,Hrmbee,science

https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mksc.2024.0838

Abstract

We study the disclosure of influencer posts on Twitter across a large set of brands based on a unique data set of over 100 million posts and a novel classification method to detect undisclosed sponsorship. Using our preferred empirical specification, we find that 96% of sponsored posts are not disclosed. This result is robust to a series of specification tests, and even a lower-bound classification still yields an undisclosed share of 82%. Despite stronger enforcement of disclosure regulations, the share of undisclosed posts decreases only slightly over time. Compared with disclosed posts, undisclosed posts tend to be associated with young brands with a large Twitter following. Using an online survey, we find that many consumers are not able to identify sponsored content without disclosure. Our findings highlight a potential need for further regulatory scrutiny and suggest that researchers studying influencers must account for undisclosed sponsored content.

From the linked article:

New Study Finds that Over 95% of Sponsored Influencer Posts on Twitter Were Not Disclosed

Key Takeaways:

UNM Researchers Plan Clinical Trials to Test Vaccine Against Alzheimer’s-Promoting Tau Protein

University of New Mexico Health Sciences researchers hope to launch human clinical trials in their quest for a vaccine to prevent the buildup of pathological tau – a protein in the brain associated with Alzheimer’s dementia.

In a new paper published in Alzheimer’s and Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association, a team led by Kiran Bhaskar, PhD, professor in the Department of Molecular Genetics & Microbiology in the UNM School of Medicine, found that the experimental vaccine generated a robust immune response in both mice and non-human primates, building on earlier research.

The new paper expands on those findings. The vaccine elicited a strong immune response in two other strains of mice bred to develop tau-related disease – one of which had a human tau gene inserted in its genome. In a collaboration with the University of California, Davis, and the California National Primate Research Center  the vaccine was also administered to macaques, primates whose immune systems and brains are closer to humans. They also showed a strong and durable immune response.

The researchers also tested antibodies in the serum from the immunized monkeys on samples of blood plasma drawn from people with mild cognitive impairment, often a precursor to full-blown Alzheimer’s dementia, as well as the sera in brain tissue from people who had died from Alzheimer’s, and found that they bound to the human version of the tau protein.",2025-04-24 10:32:03,18,mvea,science

Dislike for opposing political groups appears more powerful than loyalty to one’s own party.

Political polarization in the United States continues to intensify beyond policy disagreements, seeping into everyday social interactions. Americans increasingly avoid or express hostility toward members of the opposing political party, affecting friendships, workplace relationships, and even family connections.

Researchers Julie M. Norman and Beniamino Green investigated whether this polarization stems primarily from political affiliation or whether other overlapping social identities might play equally important roles. Their study also examined whether individuals with “cross-cutting” identities—those who don’t fit typical partisan stereotypes—experience reduced polarization.

The researchers conducted a conjoint survey experiment with 1,330 participants, presenting them with pairs of hypothetical individuals described by various characteristics: political party, ideology, race, religion, income, and education level. Participants evaluated these profiles and indicated their social preferences—whom they would choose as a friend, neighbor, or family member.

By measuring both attitudes and projected interpersonal choices, the study distinguished between abstract partisan dislike and actual willingness to exclude others based on political identity.

The results clearly demonstrated that partisan identity outweighs all other social factors in shaping Americans’ attitudes toward others. Political party affiliation emerged as the strongest predictor of both in-group favoritism and out-group bias.",2025-03-27 19:45:06,6,chrisdh79,science

https://www.jtcvstechniques.org/article/S2666-2507(25)00141-5/fulltext

From the linked article: 

World’s first “nonstop beating heart” transplant is a medical breakthrough

For the first time, surgeons have successfully performed a remarkable new heart transplant in which the donor organ never skips a beat in the process, reducing the damage that can occur during such a complex operation. It ushers in a new era of more successful heart transplant surgery.

A team of surgeons at the National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) in Taipei undertook the revolutionary operation, during which the donor heart continues beating between the organ removal and transplantation stages. Traditionally, the donor heart would be removed and preserved in cold storage to reduce its workload – during this stage, it’s considered “ischemic time,” or the period during which the organ is cut off from blood supply. This comes with the risk of heart damage and rejection once it’s transplanted into a recipient.

When the heart is deprived of blood, ischemia – a shortage of oxygen – can damage its muscle tissue, or myocardium, reducing function and health once it is transplanted. While an organ set for transplant rarely endures more than a few hours in ischemic time, it can still lead to myocardial damage.

So the NTUH team skipped this interim, performing the zero-ischemic time transplant that saw the heart continue to beat while between bodies.

As for the patient, the 49-year-old woman with dilated cardiomyopathy was discharged from hospital not long after her surgery last August and is doing well. Subsequent post-operative appointments have shown that the woman maintains a low level of cardiac enzyme – something that spikes in typical transplant conditions, indicating heart muscle injury.",2025-04-17 12:18:29,28,mvea,science
mnryzau,1k1bbqj,reddit,"For those reading and assuming some morbid connotations, the donor heart was hooked up to machinery in the time it took to move from the donor operating room to the recipient. There was not a moment where two bodies were laying next to each other and the heart cut out and moved across.

In time, this means that donor hearts will be provided with much more complex machinery to enable continuous beating after being removed. Up until this point, the zero-ischemic had not been performed and the idea of going through the trouble of keeping the heart beating during a transplant would be seen as wasted effort or too costly.

Now, with this study showing that keeping the heart beating after it has been removed from the donor does in fact reduce damage and risk of rejection, we can anticipate seeing much more complex organ transplant containers than a simple cooler.",2025-04-18 15:48:58,9,Nac_Lac,science

mof2k0m,1k54s3w,reddit,"From the article: Residues of the insecticide DDT have been found to persist at “alarming rates” in trout even after 70 years, potentially posing a significant danger to humans and wildlife that eat the fish, research has found.

Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, known as DDT, was used on forested land in New Brunswick, Canada, from 1952 to 1968. The researchers found traces of it remained in brook trout in some lakes, often at levels 10 times higher than the recommended safety threshold for wildlife.

“DDT is a probable carcinogen that we haven’t used in 70 years here [Canada], yet it’s abundant in fish and lake mud throughout much of the province at shockingly high levels,” said Josh Kurek, an associate professor in environmental change and aquatic biomonitoring at Mount Allison University in Canada and lead author of the research.

The research, [published](https://plos.io/4lp9Fhx) in the journal Plos One, discovered that DDT pollution covers about 50% of New Brunswick province. Brook trout is the most common wild fish caught in the region, and the research found DDT was present in its muscle tissue, in some cases 10 times above the recommended Canadian wildlife guidelines.

Researchers said DDT, which is classified by health authorities as a“probable carcinogen”, can persist in lake mud for decades after treatment and that many lakes in New Brunswick retain such high levels of legacy DDT that the sediments are a key source of pollution in the food web.

“The public, especially vulnerable populations to contaminants such as women of reproductive age and children, need to be aware of exposure risk to legacy DDT through consumption of wild fish,” said Kurek.",2025-04-22 12:14:24,76,chrisdh79,science

mkwfp41,1jp3jm3,reddit,">The study found that 68% (276) participants randomised to Bypass achieved at least 50% excess weight loss after three years, compared to 25% (97) for Band and 41% (141) for Sleeve. On average trial participants lost 26.5kg (just over 4 stone). Some people lost  as much as 98 kg (over 15 stone). There were a few that gained weight (<10%).

>Bypass led to a greater reduction in comorbidities, such as high blood pressure and diabetes. Bypass was found to be the most cost effective option when taking into account patients’ quality of life using a standard UK cost threshold applied by NICE. So, although Bypass was a more costly operation initially, it led to better quality of life and lower healthcare costs after three years compared to the other two surgeries.

Miscommunication between hospital staff regularly puts patients at risk, a new study says.

Poor communications between health care workers contributed to 25% of hospital incidents that put patients’ safety at risk, researchers reported Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine.

What’s more, miscommunication was the sole cause of patient endangerment in 1 out of 10 cases, researchers found.

These cases included medication errors and medical errors that resulted in health-threatening events or near-misses, researchers said.

On average, about 1 in every 20 patients is exposed to preventable harm in health care, researchers said in background notes.",2025-04-16 12:23:43,2,mvea,science

""When looking at the 2353 participants who continued, those still remaining at 12-months were slightly older and **less likely to have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder.**"" while nearly 12% of participants dropped out ""participants withdrew due to lack of therapeutic benefit (132, 41%), finding an alternative treatment (70, 22%), unwanted side-effects (64, 20%), and financial cost (57, 17%).""

Anxiety, depression, insomnia, and pain also improved over time for those with corresponding health conditions.

Research into the therapeutic benefits of medicinal cannabis has increased since the discovery of the analgesic properties in cannabis plant compounds. In 2016, advocacy groups lobbied the Australian government to bring about legislation changes that allow patients who were not responding to conventional treatment to access medicinal cannabis with a prescription from clinicians. More than one million new patients in Australia have received medicinal cannabis prescriptions for more than 200 health conditions.

A multicenter prospective study called the QUEST initiative (QUality of life Evaluation STudy) recruited adult patients with any chronic health condition newly prescribed medicinal cannabis oil between November 2020 and December 2021. Tait and colleagues gathered 12-month follow-up data to determine if previously reported improvements at three months would be maintained long-term. Of 2744 consenting participants who completed baseline assessments, 2353 also completed at least one follow-up questionnaire and were included in analyses, with completion rates declining to 778/2353 (38%) at 12 months. Participants with clinician-diagnosed conditions completed questionnaires covering condition-specific symptoms, and HRQL, which encompasses physical, emotional, social, and cognitive function, as well as bodily discomfort.

moe6thb,1k50b4l,reddit,"**Confirmation of Breslow’s hypothesis: A carbene stable in liquid water**

Abstract

In 1958, Breslow proposed that the coenzyme thiamine, also known as vitamin B1, acted as a source of transient carbenes that facilitated the catalytic activity of various important enzymes. This was a controversial hypothesis, as, then and still now, carbenes are believed to be incompatible with water. Although evidence such as deuterium labeling experiments and the trapping of the so-called Breslow intermediate support Breslow’s hypothesis, no spectroscopic evidence has ever been presented to prove that carbenes can exist or be generated in water. In this study, we disclose the synthesis and complete spectroscopic characterization by nuclear magnetic resonance and a single-crystal structure of a carbene that can be generated in water and isolated as a stable species, thus unambiguously validating Breslow’s visionary hypothesis.

From the linked article: 

Microplastics pollution from glitter can disrupt marine biomineralisation

The research, led by a team from Trinity’s School of Natural Sciences and published in the journal Environmental Sciences Europe, shows that these microplastics promote the crystallisation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) minerals, potentially affecting the growth and stability of marine calcifying organisms. 

Glitter is widely used in cosmetics, arts and crafts, fashion, and holiday decorations to add sparkle and shine. It is also used in industrial applications, such as automotive paints, textiles, and anti-counterfeiting materials. Its versatility makes it popular across many industries, but its small size and plastic composition raise environmental concerns. 

This material is made of shiny plastic pieces with sizes of 0.5 mm or smaller, with multiple layers. The main component of glitter is known as PET (polyethylene terephthalate) and is a strong, lightweight plastic commonly used in packaging, and textiles. It is durable and resistant to water but persists in the environment, contributing to plastic pollution.  

However, glitter is made of a plastic base of PET coated with very thin layers of metals and colour dyes to make it reflective. This layered structure makes it more durable, but also harder to break down in the environment. Most glitter waste eventually makes its way into seawater due to its small size, lightweight nature, and widespread use, making it difficult to capture in waste management systems.

The researchers discovered that PET-based glitter microplastics can actively promote the crystallisation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) minerals in seawater. Their experiments revealed that the surface properties of these microplastics, particularly their irregular textures and functional chemical groups, create favourable sites for mineral crystallisation. This means that when PET glitter is present in seawater, calcium carbonate forms more readily on its surface, potentially influencing the natural biomineralisation processes of marine organisms that rely on CaCO3 to build their shells and skeletons.

In addition to promoting crystallisation, the study found that glitter microplastics undergo structural changes during the mineral formation process, leading to cracks, peeling, and the release of smaller micro- and nanoplastic fragments, even as small as 0.001 mm. This suggests that microplastics not only interact with mineralisation but may also degrade more rapidly in marine environments, contributing to the spread of even smaller plastic particles.",2025-04-02 17:32:08,18,mvea,science

Abstract

Money scripts are deep-seated but typically unconscious beliefs individuals hold about money. We considered four money scripts: money avoidance, money focus (also known as money worship), money status, and money privacy (adapted from money vigilance). While money scripts have been studied in conjunction with financial outcomes, our study is among the first to test relational outcomes of money scripts and among the first to examine money scripts on the dyad level. Grounded in couples and finances theory (CFT), we conducted an actor partner interdependence mediation model (APIMeM) using dyadic data from 1,153 mixed-gender couples who had been married for about eight years to test (a) associations from couples’ average level on each money script, couples’ profile-based similarity on the money scripts collectively, and couples’ difference-score-based similarity on each money script with wives’ and husbands’ financial communication and relationship satisfaction, and (b) indirect effects on relationship satisfaction through financial communication as a mediator. High levels of money focus adherence were relationally destructive (i.e., worse financial communication, worse marital satisfaction). Similarity between spouses on money scripts collectively was relationally beneficial (i.e., better financial communication). We discuss implications for clinicians such as therapists and educators.

From the linked article: 

A new study published in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships has found that couples who are overly focused on money tend to communicate less effectively about finances and are less satisfied in their marriages. However, couples who share similar money-related beliefs—known as “money scripts”—tend to have better financial communication, which may benefit their relationship overall. The findings suggest that aligning financial attitudes and keeping money in perspective may help couples maintain a healthier and happier marriage.

The results showed that when both spouses strongly endorsed money focus beliefs—such as never feeling satisfied with what they have and believing money is the key to happiness—they tended to report poorer communication about finances. In turn, this lower quality of financial communication was linked to lower marital satisfaction for both husbands and wives. These findings suggest that obsessing over money can make it harder for couples to talk constructively about financial matters, which may negatively affect how happy they feel in their marriage.

“Other research I’ve conducted has found that people who are highly materialistic tend to have less satisfying marriages, so this finding about the money focus script made sense. The takeaway here is that focusing too much on money (especially to the point of obsession or never being satisfied) can negatively impact your relationships. Money focus can make it harder to have high-quality communication about money with your spouse and makes it more likely that you will be unhappy in your marriage. Couples should put money in its proper place and prioritize relationships–what actually matters in life–above money and possessions.”

The researchers also found that when couples had similar overall patterns of money beliefs—what the study calls “profile-based similarity”—they reported better communication about finances. However, similarity on specific money scripts, such as money status or money privacy, did not appear to make a difference. This suggests that being aligned in one’s general approach to money may support more productive financial conversations, even if couples don’t agree on every individual belief.

Another important finding was that financial communication was strongly related to relationship satisfaction for both husbands and wives. When spouses reported that they could talk about money openly and effectively, they were also more likely to feel satisfied in their relationship. This held true even when controlling for factors such as income, education, number of children, and working hours. These results highlight the importance of financial conversations in shaping how couples feel about each other.",2025-04-13 18:42:39,7,mvea,science

Daily doses of peanuts tackle allergic reactions in adults

The first clinical trial to test whether adults allergic to peanuts can be desensitised has shown great success with two thirds of the cohort consuming the equivalent of four peanuts without reacting.

The Grown Up Peanut Immunotherapy (GUPI) trial is the first study entirely in adults with severe allergy to test whether daily doses of peanuts taken under strict supervision can be safely tolerated.

The approach, known as oral immunotherapy, has seen success in trials in infants and children worldwide. The findings of the first trial in an exclusive adult cohort has been published today in the journal Allergy by a research team from King’s College London and Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust. The study is funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Research for Patient Benefit Programme.

Chief Investigator Professor Stephen Till, Professor of Allergy in the School of Immunology & Microbial Sciences, said: “Constant fear of life-threatening reactions place a huge burden on people with peanut allergy. The only way to manage a peanut allergy is strict avoidance and treatment of allergic reactions, including with adrenaline. Although peanut immunotherapy is known to be effective in children, this trial provides preliminary evidence that adults can also be desensitised and that this improves quality of life. The average tolerated dose of peanuts increased 100-fold over the course of the trial.”

Results showed that 67% of participants were able to consume at least 1.4g peanut protein – the equivalent of five peanuts – without reacting. Participants of the trial then could consume peanuts every day at home to remain desensitised.

Professor Till said: “We are very pleased with the results. The efficacy rate is broadly in line with peanut oral immunotherapy trials in children. The next stage of the research will be confirming this in larger trials, and also identifying the group of adult patients who would most likely benefit from oral immunotherapy, and see whether it can lead to long-term tolerance in this age group.”",2025-04-24 14:05:29,58,mvea,science

Exercise May Slow Brain Aging and Cognitive Decline

High physical activity levels may help preserve brain volume and cognitive function, reducing the risk of Alzheimer’s.

Summary

A UT Southwestern study finds that higher cardiorespiratory fitness may slow age-related brain atrophy, preserving cognitive function. The study, which analyzed 172 adults, showed that those with better physical fitness had larger brain volumes and better cognitive performance, especially in areas linked to memory and reasoning.

Key Takeaways

Higher physical activity is linked to less brain shrinkage, particularly in the right superior parietal area.

Larger brain volumes in this area correlate with better cognitive function, including memory and reasoning.

The findings suggest that lifelong exercise may slow brain aging and reduce dementia risks.",2025-04-18 14:09:13,11,mvea,science

mobn68y,1k4orlh,reddit,"Key points from this article:

>Over the years, scientists have made numerous attempts to sum up the evidence for and against beet juice. The latest attempt, published in Sports Medicine by a group led by Eric Tsz‑Chun Poon of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, is an “umbrella review” of nitrate supplementation, mostly from beet juice. It pools the results of 20 previous reviews that themselves aggregated the data from 180 individual studies with a total of 2,672 participants.
>
>The problem with lumping that many studies together is that they measure outcomes differently, use different dosing protocols, and have different study populations. Still, the broad conclusion is that beet juice works—at least for some outcomes. Most significantly, it improves time to exhaustion: if you’re asked to run or cycle at a given pace for as long as you can, beet juice helps you go for longer.
>
>On the other hand, there was no statistically significant benefit for time trials, where you cover a given distance as quickly as possible. That’s the type of competition we care about in the real world, so this non-result is concerning. Time-to-exhaustion tests produce much bigger changes than time trials: a common rule of thumb is that a 15 percent change in time to exhaustion corresponds to about one percent in a time trial. So it may simply be that the studies were too small to detect subtle improvements in time trial performance.
>
>...
>
>Poon and his colleagues also run some further analysis to check whether the dose makes a difference. They conclude that the effects are biggest when you take at least 6 mmoL (just under 400 grams) of nitrate per day, which happens to be almost exactly how much a single concentrated shot of beet juice contains. The effects are also maximized when you supplement for at least three consecutive days rather than just taking some on the day of a race.
>
>The big open question that Poon’s review doesn’t address is whether beet juice works in highly trained athletes. Several studies have found that the effect is either diminished or eliminated entirely in elite subjects. This isn’t surprising. Pretty much every intervention you can think of, including training itself, will have a smaller effect on people who are already well-trained. This ceiling effect is presumably because elite athletes have already optimized their physiology so thoroughly that there’s less room to improve.
>
>The flip side of that coin is that, for elite athletes, even minuscule improvements can be the difference between victory and defeat. The size of a worthwhile improvement at the highest level is a fraction of a percent, which is all but impossible to reliably detect in typical sports science studies. For top athletes, the decision of whether or not to use beet juice will have to remain an educated guess for now.

Journal link: [Dietary Nitrate Supplementation and Exercise Performance: An Umbrella Review of 20 Published Systematic Reviews with Meta-analyses](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40085422/)

Abstract:

>**Background**: Dietary nitrate (NO3-) supplementation is purported to benefit exercise performance. However, previous studies have evaluated this nutritional strategy with various performance outcomes, exercise tasks, and dosing regimens, often yielding inconsistent results that limit the generalizability of the findings.
>
>**Objective**: We aimed to synthesize the available evidence regarding the effect of NO3- supplementation on 11 domains of exercise performance.
>
>**Methods**: An umbrella review was reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Overviews of Reviews guideline. Seven databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database, CINAHL, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science) were searched from inception until July 2024. Systematic reviews with meta-analyses comparing NO3- supplementation and placebo-controlled conditions were included. Literature search, data extraction, and methodological quality assessment (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews Assessing the Methodological quality of SysTemAtic Review [AMSTAR-2]) were conducted independently by two reviewers.
>
>**Results**: Twenty systematic reviews with meta-analyses, representing 180 primary studies and 2672 unique participants, met the inclusion criteria. Our meta-analyses revealed mixed effects of NO3- supplementation. It improved time-to-exhaustion tasks [standardized mean difference (SMD): 0.33; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19-0.47] with subgroup analyses indicating more pronounced improvements when a minimum dose of 6 mmoL/day (372 mg/day) and chronic (> 3 days) supplementation protocol was implemented. Additionally, ergogenic effects of NO3- supplementation were observed for total distance covered (SMD: 0.42; 95% CI 0.09-0.76), muscular endurance (SMD: 0.48; 95% CI 0.23-0.74), peak power output (PPO; SMD: 0.25; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.39), and time to PPO (SMD: - 0.76; 95% CI - 1.18, - 0.33). However, no significant improvements were found for other performance outcomes (all p > 0.05). The AMSTAR-2 ratings of most included reviews ranged from low to critically low.
>
>**Conclusions**: This novel umbrella review with a large-scale meta-analysis provides an updated synthesis of evidence on the effects of NO3- supplementation across various aspects of exercise performance. Our review also highlights significant methodological quality issues that future systematic reviews in this field should address to enhance the reliability of evidence.",2025-04-21 21:14:43,41,Hrmbee,science

Grab yourself a 1L fermenting jar with an airlock.

Wash it out in hot water, rinse in hot water, then dry it in the oven.

Peel and dice your beetroot into chunks but not too small. Prepare a saltwater solution of 3 cups of water to 1 heaping tablespoon of salt. Rock salt is ideal, some say you shouldn't use iodized salt but I've never had any issues with it.

Pack the beetroot in the jar, then completely cover with the salt water. Make sure your jar has cooled somewhat so the salt water doesn't crack the jar.

No parts of beetroot should be poking above the water. Lactobacillus is an anaerobic strain. If plant matter is exposed, aerobic strains could take hold and make you sick.

Fit the lid and put it in a cool dark space for about 2 weeks. I use under my kitchen sink.

If there is anything growing on top of the water when you check on it, it's no good and you need to toss it.

When you crack the lid at the end, it should smell a bit vinegary or funky but not unpleasant. Sort of like kimchi or sauerkraut. When you've cracked the lid you need to store it in the fridge, but only loosely fit the lid unless the airlock is still attached. The culture is still alive and it could explode.

You can eat the beetroot and drink the kvass at this point. 

Also be aware that anything home-fermented has a risk of food poisoning attached. If you've done it right it should be safe, but always err on the side of caution.",2025-04-22 08:41:47,1,SoulMasterKaze,science

mkq8sur,1joafnc,reddit,"> In the study, the researchers found that levels of a protein called MTBR-tau243 in the blood accurately reflect the amount of toxic accumulation of tau aggregates in the brain and correlate with the severity of Alzheimer’s disease. Analyzing blood levels of MTBR-tau243 from a group of people with cognitive decline, the researchers were able to distinguish between people with early- or later-stage Alzheimer’s disease and separate both groups of Alzheimer’s patients from people whose symptoms were caused by something other than Alzheimer’s disease.



>The researchers’ analysis showed that blood MTBR-tau243 levels reflected the amount of tau tangles in the brain with 92% accuracy. MTBR-tau243 levels in the blood were normal in asymptomatic people regardless of amyloid status, meaning that blood MTBR-tau243 levels do not change between healthy people and people in the presymptomatic stage of Alzheimer’s disease with amyloid plaques.
>
>Among people with cognitive symptoms due to Alzheimer’s disease, MTBR-tau243 levels were significantly elevated for people in the mild cognitive impairment phase of Alzheimer’s disease and much higher — up to 200 times — for those in the dementia phase. Those differences translated into clear separation of people in early- and late-stage Alzheimer’s disease. At the same time, MTBR-tau243 levels were normal in people with cognitive symptoms due to diseases other than Alzheimer’s, meaning that the test effectively distinguished Alzheimer’s dementia from other kinds of dementia.

mond4vb,1k65z3h,reddit,"From the article: Young adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder who play an instrument may outperform their non-musical peers on a range of cognitive tasks, according to new research [published](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00426-024-02048-2) in Psychological Research. The study found that adults with ADHD who had received long-term training in piano or guitar showed stronger performance on measures of attention, memory, processing speed, and executive functioning. These results suggest that learning and practicing an instrument could support cognitive skills that are typically challenging for individuals with ADHD.

ADHD is a common neurodevelopmental condition marked by difficulties with attention, hyperactivity, and impulse control. It often persists into adulthood, where it can affect academic achievement, occupational functioning, and relationships. Although many treatment strategies focus on medication and behavioral therapy, there is growing interest in non-traditional interventions that might strengthen the underlying cognitive processes affected by the disorder.

Music, with its known benefits for brain plasticity, memory, and emotional regulation, has emerged as a promising candidate. While past studies have shown that music training can enhance brain development in children and support cognitive health in older adults, research specifically focused on individuals with ADHD remains limited—especially among adults. This new study sought to close that gap by examining whether musical training is associated with cognitive improvements in young adults diagnosed with ADHD.

The author of the study, Sivan Raz, recruited 94 participants between the ages of 18 and 35, all of whom had a formal diagnosis of ADHD. The sample included two groups: 48 musicians who had played either piano or guitar for at least five years, and 46 non-musicians with no formal training. Both groups were carefully matched on age, sex, education level, and socioeconomic background. Importantly, none of the participants were taking ADHD medication during the study period.",2025-04-23 18:06:54,47,chrisdh79,science

mnal6s6,1jzyh9w,reddit,"Sounds about right. ""Autism"" has probably been around since the dawn of humanity. However, we are just recently defining it, based on our current norms of society. Further, more people are informed. The stigma is very much still there, but slowly decreasing. So no surprise *TO ME* that there are more diagnoses. 

Neurodivergence is normal among all people. Some people present neurodivergent behaviors more than others, some mask, and some only present when under duress. This is why it is a spectrum...and even ""neurotypical"" people present behaviors that are on that spectrum. Based on how practitioners currently define ASD though, those neurodivergent features only become a disorder when patients have trouble integrating within society and navigating daily life.

Not here to argue the science, but do want to remind everyone that as late as the 1950s, left-handedness was still considered a disorder and was stigmatized. But now, we know how ridiculous that sounds and left handed people make up 10% of the population. Instead of trying to fix those people, we made things more accessible (e.g., left handed scissors). Similarly, if rates of autism increase and eventually plateau, maybe we need to accept it and stop trying to find a cure. Instead, maybe we need to change societal norms and make things more accessible and inclusive for those people. Still leaving room for the possibility that there may be a potential cause, but until we/if we ever get there we can attack this from many angles.",2025-04-15 20:22:39,172,ramonycajal88,science

Now school systems nationwide have massive support and resources so many parents see an autism diagnosis as a free ticket to additional help in school, smaller classes, testing accommodations, free choice of school, etc. Unfortunately less-scrupulous psychologists are very quick to label the kids as having autism because the schools have to accept a licensed psychologist's opinion even if the school psychologist and teachers all disagree. It's pay to ""play"".

""They've again gone up dramatically, just in two years. We have in some states as low as 1 out of 20 boys having autism, 1 out of 31 kids. And when I was, in my generation today, the rate of autism was 1 in 10,000,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Tuesday in Indiana, announcing the new findings. ""And this is just one disease. This whole generation of kids is damaged by chronic disease."" 

Kennedy often cites the CDC's figures from this study as evidence for his claim that the U.S. is now seeing a growing ""epidemic"" of autism, which experts and advocacy groups have criticized as stigmatizing and misleading.

""As the report indicates, more children have access to evaluations for autism and more children are being identified as autistic. This is encouraging because when children are identified early, appropriate supports and services can be tailored to help them, and their families thrive,"" said Dr. Kristin Sohl, of the American Academy of Pediatrics subcommittee on autism, in a statement.

mni3xu9,1jzyh9w,reddit,"It seems there is definitely a real increase in autism rates, even taking into account changes in diagnostic criteria and awareness. Around 20% or more of people with autism are nonverbal. Even before changes to the diagnostic criteria and awareness, it is very likely that you would have been noticed if you were nonverbal. And 20% of 3% (0.6%) is still much more than overall rates of autism a few decades ago. It is possible that these people were misdiagnosed with other conditions, but the numbers are so large that it is still quite suggestive of a real increase in the rate of autism. National health agencies don't track severe forms of autism, but I vaguely recall efforts to estimate rates of type 3 autism showed that it has also been on the rise. The only thing we're sure of is that it's not vaccines. It's annoying that we're still wasting money on that. I also think that we've gone a bit too far in trying to be inclusive: by that I mean not too far in terms of accepting people who are different from us, but too far in terms of making the label too broadly applicable.


The way we define autism is problematic: several groups of symptoms have now been unified under one label, and it's basically a question of whether you tick enough boxes and whether your behaviors are extreme enough to qualify under the autism label. It's very hard for me to imagine that we can be objective about this. Just listening to people with autism (or autistic people, whatever you prefer) talk about their experiences, I feel as if I may have autism as well. Questionnaires read like Myers-Briggs tests or even horoscope charts. For me, personally, I wouldn't care too much if I were diagnosed with autism anymore because there's less stigma, which is to say that I'm inclined to really try hard and answer questions honestly, but I'm mostly just confused by them. When a person with autism says that they don't want to follow a social rule and that the stress of doing so will lead to a meltdown, it also comes off a bit strange to me. The reason is that neurotypical people also don't generally *want* to follow social rules, but we've been conditioned to do so as toddlers. As part of the process of that conditioning, or ""socialization,"" as it's normally called, we may expect what looks like the neurotypical version of meltdowns - tantrums (not claiming they're the same thing, but they look similar). It also implies that we want to stand in lines, take turns, or share our stuff. No, I don't think we generally like doing those things, but we accept them as necessary for the reward of getting along. Even when it comes to big daddy of autism signs - avoiding eye contact - I'm not sure if I or others would do this naturally. In other words, I think I may have been conditioned (or socialized) to maintain comfortable levels of eye contact as a signal that I am paying attention to people when they are talking to me. I now do this instinctually, without thought. It is even stranger when you consider that if these things aren't entirely natural or instinctual at birth, does this mean you are covering up autism? Does this mean that, since nearly everyone required conditioning or socialization, whether they are now aware of it or not, nearly everyone is covering up autism?

As an emotion researcher myself, I'd say a big limitation is the range of emotions coded for. If you look at only 5 negative emotions, it's not as surprising to see not much variability. Why just negative, too? Would be nice to get a wider sense of what's going on.

moodm72,1k699i9,reddit,"How you pull scientific data off of “~~four~~ three (since one was banned 8 years ago) openly declared misogynistic and misandric Reddit communities is absolutely beyond me... but let's look.

>We conducted our analysis on the following four Reddit extremist communities:

>Feminism: r/Feminism is a feminist political subreddit discussing women’s issues. It has 277,000 users and more than 50% of the posts have been assessed to exhibit a predominantly negative sentiment46.

>GenderCritical: The subreddit r/GenderCritical had 64,400 users and self-described as “reddit’s most active feminist community” for “women-centred, radical feminists” to discuss “gender from a gender-critical perspective”. In 2020, the subreddit was banned for violating Reddit’s rule against promoting hate and transphobia.

>Incels: r/Incels was a forum wherein members discussed their lack of partnering success. Many members adhered to the “black pill” ideology, which espoused despondency often coupled with misogynistic views. The subreddit was banned in 2017, and at that time it counted 40,000 subscribers.

I'm surprised they didn't include r/FemaleDatingStrategy considering... well you know..

>MensRights: Created in 2008, the “antifeminist” subreddit r/MensRights has over 300,000 members as of April 2021. It has been recognized as one of “the most striking features of the new antifeminist politics”.

I'm already seeing issues here in how this data is harvested, and you can't verify any of these posts are in good faith and an actual representation of the commenter's feelings.

>The words “women” and “men” appears more often in the misogynistic and misandric subreddits, respectively (as an expected consequence of the filtering step), with relative frequencies of 19% and 20% on Incels and Mensrights for “women”, and of 17% and 15% on Feminism and Gendercritical for “men”. Notably, these words occur almost likewise frequently in the counterpart communities: in particular, the word “women” occurs on Feminism and Gendercritical with a relative frequency of 16% and 14%, respectively; while the word “men”, occurs on Incels and Mensrights in the 8% and 15% of the cases, respectively.

As opposed to what? r/pics? r/butterflygold? The study frankly doesn't have a good control.

And I want to be clear that I'm only criticizing the data that this study is relying on for it's conclusions, not the conclusions themselves.

>The first limitation of this study stems from the reliance on open-source platform data, which is inherently prone to noise.These datasets often contain inconsistencies, irrelevant information, or errors that can affect the quality of the analysis. To address this, as detailed in the Analysis Section, we applied a pre-processing pipeline to clean the textual data by removing punctuation, digits, and stop words. While this step significantly reduces noise, it cannot guarantee perfectly clean data.

I don't think clearing ""grammar"" leads to data that is any cleaner, in this instance, compared to ""grammatical data,"" which it seems like what this paper is claiming.

mkdgijo,1jmpl2i,reddit,"Abstract:

The smartphone helps workers balance the demands of their professional and personal lives but can also be a distraction, affecting productivity, wellbeing, and work-life balance. Drawing from insights on the impact of physical environments on object engagement, this study examines how the distance between the smartphone and the user influences interactions in work contexts. Participants (N = 22) engaged in two 5h knowledge work sessions on the computer, with the smartphone placed outside their immediate reach during one session. Results show that limited smartphone accessibility led to reduced smartphone use, but participants shifted non-work activities to the computer and the time they spent on work and leisure activities overall remained unchanged. These findings suggest that discussions on smartphone disruptiveness in work contexts should consider the specific activities performed, challenging narratives of ‘smartphone addiction’ and ‘smartphone overuse’ as the cause of increased disruptions and lowered work productivity.

mndsmp4,1k0gl7n,reddit,"**Human skeletal muscle possesses both reversible proteomic signatures and a retained proteomic memory after repeated resistance training**

Abstract

Investigating repeated resistance training (RT) separated by a training break enables exploration of the potential for a proteomic memory of RT-induced skeletal muscle growth, i.e. retained protein adaptations from the previous RT. Our aim was to examine skeletal muscle proteome response to 10-week RT (RT1) followed by 10-week training cessation (i.e. detraining, DT), and finally, 10-week retraining (RT2). Thirty healthy, untrained participants conducted either periodic RT (RT1-DT-RT2, n = 17) or a 10-week no-training control period (n = 13) followed by 20 weeks of RT (n = 11). RT included twice-weekly supervised whole-body RT sessions, and resting vastus lateralis biopsies were obtained every 10 weeks for proteomics analysis using high-end dia-PASEF's mass spectrometry. The first RT period altered 150 proteins (93% increased) involved in, for example, energy metabolism and protein processing compared to minor changes during the control period. The proteome adaptations were similar after the second RT compared to baseline demonstrating reproducibility in proteome adaptations to RT. Many of the proteins induced by RT1 were reversed towards baseline after detraining and increased again after retraining. These reversible proteins were especially involved in aerobic energy metabolism. Interestingly, several proteins which increased after RT1 remain elevated (i.e. retained) after detraining, including carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1) and proteins involved in muscle contraction, cytoskeleton and calcium binding. Among the latter, calcium-activated protease calpain-2 (CAPN2) has been recently identified as an epigenetic muscle memory gene. We show that resistance training evokes retained protein levels even after 2.5 months of no training, which demonstrates a potential proteomic memory of resistance training-induced muscle growth in human skeletal muscle.

mkboyuw,1jmh9rf,reddit,"**Abstract**

Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are persistent, bioaccumulative and anthropogenic pollutants that have attracted the attention of the public and private sectors because of their adverse impact on human health. Although various technologies have been deployed to degrade PFASs with a focus on non-polymeric functionalized compounds (perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid), a general PFAS destruction method coupled with fluorine recovery for upcycling is highly desirable. Here we disclose a protocol that converts multiple classes of PFAS, including the fluoroplastics polytetrafluoroethylene and polyvinylidene fluoride, into high-value fluorochemicals. To achieve this, PFASs were reacted with potassium phosphate salts under solvent-free mechanochemical conditions, a mineralization process enabling fluorine recovery as KF and K2PO3F for fluorination chemistry. The phosphate salts can be recovered for reuse, implying no detrimental impact on the phosphorus cycle. Therefore, PFASs are not only destructible but can now contribute to a sustainable circular fluorine economy.

The study was conducted by the University of Adelaide’s Professor Christine Beasley and Dr Pam Papadelos together with Dr Perry Beasley-Hall, Dr Michelle Guzik and Associate Professor Anne Hewitt also from the University of Adelaide, as well as Dr Kate Umbers from Western Sydney University.

“Scientific societies are generally defined as non-government, member-based, politically impartial, non-profit organisations that promote scientific research and raise the profile of the science community. They employ characterisations from and the expertise of the scientifically based members of the team,” explains Professor Beasley.

“Our findings show that women in science communication roles within scientific societies often feel personally responsible for this work, despite it being unpaid and undervalued.

“Women reported that science communication had a limiting effect on their careers. While they found it personally rewarding, it was not recognised as significant for career advancement.”

Dr Papadelos describes this as a “paradox of relationality”, where women experience both benefits and disadvantages — relationality meaning recognising and prioritising inherent social connection.

“The study outlines that while women gain personal satisfaction and emotional fulfilment from this work, it also takes away time from paid roles or tasks that would advance their careers,” Dr Papadelos says.

mm8kmef,1jvab0r,reddit,"A new study published in Evolutionary Psychology finds that personality trait conscientiousness—the tendency to be organized, responsible, self-disciplined, and goal-oriented—is consistently linked to having more children across cultures, suggesting it may be favored by natural selection.

Researchers understand that personality traits are influenced by both genetics and behavior, making them potential targets for natural selection. According to evolutionary theory, traits positively linked to reproductive success should become more common over time. Previous research has shown mixed results regarding how the “Big Five” personality traits (extraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness) relate to having children, with findings often varying by cultural context.

While prior studies have generally found positive links between extraversion and having more children, and negative associations between neuroticism and reproductive success, evidence for the other three traits has been inconsistent. This raises important questions about whether these traits are under selective pressures and if these pressures might vary across different environments.

mm6ybjz,1jv39t5,reddit,"From the article: Group A streptococcus (GAS) – which may be best known by one of its manifestations, ""strep throat"" – is caused by the Streptococcus pyogenes bacterium and can have more serious outcomes than, for example, pharyngitis. Also known as ""invasive strep,"" this bug can cause necrotizing fasciitis, a flesh-eating disease, as well as toxic shock syndrome, a sepsis-like infection that can trigger organ failure.

The comprehensive report out of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) highlights the value of long-term research into the epidemiology of infectious illnesses that had, up to a certain point, remained rare and stable.

""Invasive GAS cases from January 1, 2013, through December 31, 2022, were identified through active surveillance for invasive bacterial pathogens in 10 US states, covering 34 ,991,238 persons,"" researchers detailed of the data gathered from California, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, Oregon, New York, New Mexico Tennessee, Connecticut and Minnesota.

Prior to 2013, infections had remained relatively low and stable for 17 years. Overall, strep's prevalence more than doubled, from 3.6 per 100,000 people to 28.2 per 100,000 people. While this doesn't seem like a lot, certain demographics are disproportionately impacted by both cases and fatalities, especially those who are socially and medically vulnerable. In total, annual cases rose from 1,082 in 2013 to 2,759 in 2022.

For the entire period, 21,312 strep cases were identified, with 1,981 deaths – nearly 10% of those who fell ill. However, people in long-term care such as aged-care had almost twice the risk of dying from their infection (17.7% of cases).

https://www.nature.com/articles/s44324-025-00056-3

Abstract

Consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) increases overall caloric intake and is associated with obesity, cardiovascular disease, and brain pathology. There is scant evidence as to why UPF consumption leads to increased caloric intake and whether the negative health consequences are due to adiposity or characteristics of UPFs. Using the UK Biobank sample, we probed the associations between UPF consumption, adiposity, metabolism, and brain structure. Our analysis reveals that high UPF intake is linked to adverse adiposity and metabolic profiles, alongside cellularity changes in feeding-related subcortical brain areas. These are partially mediated by dyslipidemia, systemic inflammation and body mass index, suggesting that UPFs exert effects on the brain beyond just contributing to obesity. This dysregulation of the network of subcortical feeding-related brain structures may create a self-reinforcing cycle of increased UPF consumption.

From the linked article: 

Ultra-processed foods linked to changes in brain regions that control eating behavior, study finds

A new study published in npj Metabolic Health and Disease suggests that eating more ultra-processed foods may not only increase the risk of obesity and poor metabolic health, but could also be associated with structural changes in brain regions involved in regulating food intake and reward. Researchers found that these changes in the brain were linked to both higher body fat and markers of inflammation, indicating that ultra-processed foods may influence the brain through multiple biological pathways—not just through increased calorie consumption.

The study found that higher UPF consumption was associated with a range of negative health indicators. People who ate more UPFs tended to have higher levels of body fat, more inflammation, worse blood sugar control, and lower levels of healthy cholesterol. They also consumed more sugar, saturated fat, and sodium.

But most strikingly, UPF intake was linked to structural differences in specific brain regions. For example, people who consumed more UPFs had signs of increased cellular density in the hypothalamus, which may reflect inflammation in this brain region. The hypothalamus plays a key role in regulating hunger and metabolism.

At the same time, participants showed signs of reduced cellular integrity in the nucleus accumbens, putamen, and pallidum—areas involved in reward and motivation, including food cravings and pleasure from eating. These findings suggest that UPF consumption may be related to both inflammation and degradation in the brain’s appetite and reward systems.",2025-04-13 10:04:32,12,mvea,science

That simple ingredient list is baffling to anyone who thinks about it, and you start getting into arguments about what makes an oil ultra-processed or not, and some of those arguments become so granular they lose people almost immediately.

In truth, it seems to most people that anything with a half-dozen ingredients gets defined by the “zealots” as ultra-processed food, which includes their mom’s meatloaf and grandma’s chicken soup.

mlqj72n,1jt0lew,reddit,">Altogether, the researchers identified 17 risk factors shared by at least two of the diseases, including blood pressure, kidney disease, fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, alcohol use, diet, hearing loss, pain, physical activity, purpose in life, sleep, smoking, social engagement, and stress. Of these, high blood pressure and severe kidney disease had the biggest impact on the incidence and burden of stroke, dementia, and late-life depression. In contrast, physical activity and engagement in leisure activities with a cognitive aspect (e.g., puzzles) were associated with a lower risk of disease, though the researchers suspect that these associations may be symptomatic rather than causal, since individuals with brain disease may be less capable of engaging in physical and cognitive leisure activities.

>Researchers found that **both low-carb diets, regardless of calorie reduction, led to improvements in the participants’ metabolic markers, and better handling of a high fat meal, including reduced levels of triglycerides** - a type of fat in the blood that may lead to heart disease - and a shift towards burning fat for energy

> The study, published in the European Journal of Nutrition, also highlighted that **while participants experienced increased hunger on the low-carbohydrate days, it didn’t translate into increased food intake over the following two days**. This suggests that the body may adapt to the reduced carb intake, potentially making it easier to adhere to this diet in the long term.

The study is looking at Lean Mass Hyper-responders (LMHR) which is a rare and specific phenotype and is not at all generalizing ketogenic diet to the wider population. The title on this post makes it look like it's generalizing to the rest of the population, so i get why some get stumped there.

It's not a bad study, and the breakdown from Dr. Idz seems like a ""gotcha"", but he is bringing up material that has nothing to do with what the study has found. Comparing this study to a reference group outside of this specific follow up is deeply flawed and makes it SEEM like a worse outcome than it is BUT there's a MASSIVE difference in population, baseline, and methodology. You can't just dismiss using a smaller sample size and then hypocritcally use those with CAC>100 subgroup in this study to compare to a larger group. It's still a red flag within the study, sure, but not close to definitive. Furthermore, most of the LMHR are at 0, and heterogeneity exists in the population, cool isn't it?

All that the study is saying is that the LMHR group did not have higher (absolute) plaque progression rate, specifically of those with no plaque in their arteries, even when linked with higher LDL as a result of a ketogenic diet. It is NOT generalizing to other populations. It is NOT suggesting high LDL isn't associated with heart disease. And it is NOT saying ketogenic diets are the best.

It's useful specifically because it challenges that assumption.

https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacadv.2025.101686

Conclusions

In lean metabolically healthy people on KD, neither total exposure nor changes in baseline levels of ApoB and LDL-C were associated with changes in plaque. Conversely, baseline plaque was associated with plaque progression, supporting the notion that, in this population, plaque begets plaque but ApoB does not. 

From the linked article: 

Keto diet's high cholesterol not a factor in heart disease, says study

One of the ketogenic diet's major perceived drawbacks is an increase in LDL, or so-called bad cholesterol. A new study, though, says that this cholesterol spike doesn't fit the conventional science in terms of its disease-causing ability.

The ketogenic diet – an eating plan that emphasizes fat and protein over carbs – has certainly had its fair share of pluses and minuses added to its balance sheet over the years.

But a new study from a range of institutes including The Lundquist Institute for Biomedical Innovation at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center has shown that the spike in LDL seen in adherents of the keto diet does not necessarily lead to heart disease, especially if they have otherwise healthy biomarkers.

The team followed 100 metabolically healthy people who stuck to the keto diet for a year. The people they used in the study were all considered Lean Mass Hyper-Responders (LMHRs), meaning that they saw elevated levels of LDL cholesterol in their blood, as well as elevated levels of a high-cholesterol marker known as apolipoprotein B (ApoB). However, these individuals also had low triglycerides, low blood pressure, low body mass index, low insulin resistance, and high levels of HDL, often called ""good"" cholesterol.

So in other words, even though they had high levels of ""bad"" cholesterol in their blood, they were, in fact, quite healthy after a year of following a keto plan. The study also could not establish any risk of increased heart disease in the patients despite their LMHR status.

They did, however, find that patients who already had plaque in their arteries were those most likely to have more plaque build-up. This led them to conclude that pre-existing plaque, rather than diet, was a stronger predictor of future plaque-related cardiovascular issues and they say that this factor, more than levels of LDL or ApoB, should be used to assess heart disease risk in the future for patients who are otherwise healthy.",2025-04-14 01:04:33,-25,mvea,science

mm7thra,1jv739q,reddit,"From the article: Children who are better at recognizing and managing emotions tend to become better readers over time—but how does that connection work? A new longitudinal study [published](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lindif.2024.102574) in Learning and Individual Differences offers an in-depth look at how emotional intelligence contributes to reading comprehension in children, and how this relationship differs depending on the type of text and a child’s family background. The researchers found that emotional intelligence predicted later reading comprehension in both narrative and non-narrative texts, and that this connection was shaped by vocabulary, word reading, and, for non-narrative texts only, working memory.

The researchers conducted this study to better understand how emotional development contributes to academic outcomes—specifically, reading comprehension. While much past research has focused on the importance of language and cognitive skills like vocabulary and memory, fewer studies have examined how non-cognitive skills such as emotional intelligence might influence children’s reading ability.

Emotional intelligence includes the ability to understand, manage, and use one’s own emotions, as well as the emotions of others. These emotional skills are increasingly seen as important not only for mental health and social relationships, but also for learning and academic success. The researchers also aimed to explore whether these effects might vary depending on the type of reading material—narrative stories versus informational texts—and whether children’s socioeconomic background plays a role in shaping these relationships.",2025-04-09 14:26:47,12,chrisdh79,science

mk679vh,1jlto1z,reddit,"Type 2 diabetes may rewire the brain in ways that mimic early Alzheimer’s disease — and UNLV researchers say the “why” may lie in a previously unexplored connection between high blood sugar levels and a key part of the brain called the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).

Diabetes is a group of diseases characterized by an imbalance of blood sugar or insulin levels. Scientists have long known that Type 2 diabetes patients are more prone to psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. The risk of developing Alzheimer’s is 65% higher in diabetics. But the exact link between diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases has been poorly understood.

The UNLV research team went searching for answers. 

Based on their findings, published this week in the Journal of Neuroscience’s Computational Properties of the Prefrontal Cortex Special Collection, it appears that diabetes weakens ACC function — suppressing reward perception and memory signals — and induces mild cognitive impairment similar to that observed during the brain’s progression towards Alzheimer’s disease.

Clinicians’ preferences for treatments that do not adhere to CDC guidelines may be driven by several clinical considerations that could affect treatment outcomes. **For chlamydia, a single-dose of azithromycin is preferred over a 7-day course of doxycycline because of concerns about patient adherence to a week of medication and the resulting need for follow-up.** **For gonorrhea, a preference for a nonrecommended therapeutic regimen—orally administered azithromycin alone—might be due to patient fear of needles.** This could make it more attractive than recommended treatments that involve intramuscular injections, such as ceftriaxone, or gentamicin alongside oral azithromycin. An alternate oral regimen—a single dose of cefixime—is also recommended for treating uncomplicated gonorrhea, but its limited efficacy could be a concern. Other factors affecting treatment choices include clinicians’ education and experience, patients’ allergies, resource availability, and delays in adopting updated guidelines in clinical practice. Greater adherence to CDC guidelines for STI treatment could lead to changes in clinical practices, ultimately improving treatment rate disparities and shortening time to first treatment. Future efforts are needed to develop and integrate a safe, effective, and standardized approach in outpatient settings to improve the outcomes of STI management.",2025-03-28 18:11:59,84,lart2150,science

moedef3,1k5193d,reddit,"Abstract


Most dog owners in Western countries regard their dogs as companions or family members, prompting extensive research on the human-animal bond. However, many studies rely on broad categories or single dimensions, such as satisfaction or attachment, which can oversimplify the complexity of these relationships. In contrast, our study employed a multifaceted approach, examining the dog-owner bond across 13 relationship scales and comparing these scales to four different types of human relationships to reveal the human-like roles of dogs within a family. Participants (N = 717) characterized their relationships with their dog and four human partners: closest kin, romantic partner, best friend, and child, using the Network of Relationships Inventory. The results showed that owners reported greater satisfaction with their dogs than with any human partner except their child. They received more Support from dogs than from any human partner except their child and experienced fewer Negative Interactions with their dogs compared to any human partner, except their best friend. Overall, the relationship with the dog provided high Companionship, opportunities for Nurturance, and minimal Negative Interactions. This may stem from the fact that the dog-human relationship features a more asymmetric power dynamic than human relationships – i.e., owners have full control over the dog’s life. Interestingly, a good relationship with a dog might also reflect the owner’s positive relationships with humans. In conclusion, the dog-human relationship exhibits characteristics of both child and best friend relationships, combining the positive aspects of the parent-child bond with the minimal negative interactions of close friendships. Characterizing the dog-owner relationship as a set of social provisions offers a valid way to evaluate relationships with dogs, providing an alternative theoretical framework to attachment theory for comparing dog-human and human-human relationships",2025-04-22 08:27:33,39,Wagamaga,science

mo8ymag,1k4coe8,reddit,"From the article: New research from the University of Sydney links fatty, sugary diets to impaired brain function. The findings build on a growing body of evidence showing the negative impact of high-fat, high-sugar (HFHS) diets on cognitive ability, adding to their well-known physical effects.

Published on Friday in the International [Journal of Obesity](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41366-025-01776-8), the research is the first to test in humans the relationship between HFHS diets, particularly those high in refined sugar and saturated fat, and first-person spatial navigation. Spatial navigation is the ability to learn and remember a path from one location to another, a process that can approximate the health of the brain’s hippocampus.

Dr Dominic Tran from the Faculty of Science’s School of Psychology led the research, which found HFHS diets have a detrimental effect on some aspects of cognitive function. It is likely those effects centre on the hippocampus, the brain structure important for spatial navigation and memory formation, rather than acting across the entire brain.

“The good news is we think this is an easily reversible situation,” Dr Tran said. “Dietary changes can improve the health of the hippocampus, and therefore our ability to navigate our environment, such as when we’re exploring a new city or learning a new route home.”

The research team recruited 55 university students aged between 18 and 38. Each participant completed questionnaires capturing their intake of sugary and fatty foods. They also had their working memory tested in a number recall exercise, and their body mass index (BMI) recorded.

The experiment itself required participants to navigate a virtual reality maze and locate a treasure chest six times. The maze was surrounded by landmarks that participants could use to remember their route. Their starting point and the location of the treasure chest remained constant in each trial.

If participants found the treasure in less than four minutes, they continued to the next trial. If they failed to find the treasure in this time, they were teleported to its location and given 10 seconds to familiarise themselves with that location before the next trial.

A seventh trial removed the treasure chest from the virtual maze but asked participants to find and mark its former location based purely on memory. Those with lower levels of fat and sugar in their diets were able to pinpoint the location with a higher degree of accuracy than those who consumed these foods multiple times a week.

“After controlling for working memory and BMI, measured separately to the experiment, participants’ sugar and fat intake was a reliable predictor of performance in that final, seventh, test,” Dr Tran said.",2025-04-21 12:49:37,6,chrisdh79,science

It might be that you can see an effect with people with a higher baseline HRV and that effect won't show up or exist in people with low baseline HRV.

mougzo9,1k71635,reddit,Perhaps the lactic acid released by mitochondria is helping make up for limit fuel sources via ketone bodies.,2025-04-24 19:47:58,42,askingforafakefriend,science
mouea30,1k71635,reddit,"We know exercise is good for our body, but what about our brains? A new study from the University of Missouri suggests that exercise plays a crucial role in keeping our minds sharp, even when one of the brain’s key energy sources isn’t available.

The study, led by Mizzou researchers Taylor Kelty and R. Scott Rector, offers fresh insight into brain health and suggests that exercise could play a bigger role in preventing cognitive decline than previously thought.

With the number of Americans expected to develop Alzheimer’s disease more than doubling by 2060, this research raises an intriguing possibility: Could regular physical activity be the key to preserving memory and cognitive performance as we age?

When the body runs low on its usual fuel — glucose — the liver makes ketones, an alternative energy source that helps power the brain. These molecules support cognitive memory, learning and overall brain health. But what happens when the liver can’t produce enough of them? Can exercise help compensate for this ketone deficiency?



In the study, the researchers looked at what happens when ketone production is limited in the liver. As expected, the result was a noticeable decline in brain function and memory. But then, something remarkable happened: Exercise still managed to help reverse some of the cognitive decline, even with the ketone production impaired.

“Going into the study, we thought that with fewer ketones and the cognitive impairments that causes, exercise may not be able to overcome that impairment,” Kelty, a postdoctoral fellow in Rector’s lab, said. “But it seems like exercise is so powerful that there are other mechanisms going on in the brain that allow it circumvent those impairments and still receive the benefits from exercise.”

mm09j0d,1ju9f25,reddit,"Mass General Brigham investigators have linked difficult early life experiences with reduced quality and quantity of the white matter communication highways throughout the adolescent brain. This reduced connectivity is also associated with lower performance on cognitive tasks. However, certain social resiliency factors like neighborhood cohesion and positive parenting may have a protective effect. Results are published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).

White matter are the communication highways that allow the brain networks to carry out the necessary functions for cognition and behavior. They develop over the course of childhood, and childhood experiences may drive individual differences in how white matter matures. Lead author Sofia Carozza, PhD, and senior author Amar Dhand, MD, PhD, of the Department of Neurology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system, wanted to understand what role this process plays in cognition once children reach adolescence.

“The aspects of white matter that show a relationship with our early life environment are much more pervasive throughout the brain than we’d thought. Instead of being just one or two tracts that are important for cognition, the whole brain is related to the adversities that someone might experience early in life,” said Carozza.

mk8juum,1jm3boa,reddit,"> Long-term fasting in 24-hour cycles increases the sex drive of male mice by lowering the concentration of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain. This effect is linked to a diet-induced deficiency of the precursor substance tryptophan – an amino acid that must be obtained through food. Researchers from DZNE report on this in the journal Cell Metabolism, together with a Chinese team from Qingdao University and the University of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences. They suggest that similar mechanisms may exist in humans and view fasting as a potential approach for treating unwanted loss of sexual desire.

>one particular finding steered their research in a new direction: aged male mice – senior individuals by human standards – that had fasted for extended periods produced an unusually large number of offspring. Contrary to initial hypotheses, this phenomenon was not due to fasting effects on reproductive organs or the endocrine state of the animals. Age-related changes in the testes, reduced sperm quality and lower testosterone levels, for example, argued against high fertility.

> “The fasting males had significantly more sexual contacts than mice that could eat freely. In other words, these animals had an unusually high frequency of mating and, as a result, an unusually high number of offspring for their age. Their mating behavior more than compensated for the age-related physiological limitations.”

> **Increased mating behavior was also observed in younger mice. These males had also started intermittent fasting at the age of two months, but had followed this diet for only six months before being introduced to females. They, too, were more sexually active than age-matched peers that had been fed ad libitum. However, the effect was absent in other experimental groups – both young and old – that fasted for only a few weeks**

mnqjtgg,1k21s5v,reddit,"From the article: If you've watched even a single episode of CSI, you'll know how important it is to check suspects and crime scenes for gunshot residue (GSR). A new technique could make that task faster and easier than ever before, by quickly causing the residue to glow green.

Current methods of checking for GSR typically involve gathering samples at the crime scene (which includes collecting swabs from suspects), transporting those samples to a forensics lab, then conducting tests to see if they contain certain telltale substances. One of those substances is lead, particles of which are utilized in the primer that ignites the bullet propellant in a cartridge.

Unfortunately, by the time that such lab tests have delivered conclusive results, suspects may have fled, or the crime scene may have been compromised.

That's where the new technique comes in. [Developed](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0379073825000532?via%3Dihub) by Wim Noorduin, Arian van Asten and colleagues at the University of Amsterdam, it utilizes an isopropyl-alcohol-based liquid which is sprayed onto surfaces at crime scenes.

A reagent chemical within that liquid – namely methyl ammonium bromide – instantly reacts with any lead particles that may be present, converting them into a semiconductor mineral known as perovskite. When that perovskite is subsequently exposed to ultraviolet light emitted by a handheld lamp, it fluoresces a bright green that is easily visible to the naked eye.

In shooting range tests, the technology successfully detected GSR on cotton cloth targets that volunteers fired upon using two 9-mm handguns (a Glock 19 Gen5 and a Walther P99Q NL) from distances of up to 2 meters (6.6 ft).

Importantly, the liquid also detected GSR on the volunteers' hands, even after repeated and vigorous washings. GSR was likewise detected on bystanders who watched as the target shootings took place.",2025-04-18 10:37:18,4,chrisdh79,science

>After a mean follow-up of 5.8 years, 2,633 participants had been diagnosed with one of the 13 cancer types. Individuals with the highest total amount of daily physical activity had a 26% lower risk of developing cancer than individuals who had the lowest amount of daily physical activity. The researchers also explored the impact of replacing daily sedentary time with light- and moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity and found that this shift was associated with a reduced risk of cancer. The associations between physical activity and cancer risk remained even after researchers adjusted for demographic factors, lifestyle factors, body mass index (BMI), and other health conditions.

>**Higher daily step count, but not the pace of the steps (step intensity), was also associated with a lower risk of cancer.

mon3vga,1k64v4i,reddit,"**High probability of triggering climate tipping points under current policies modestly amplified by Amazon dieback and permafrost thaw**

Abstract

We investigate the probabilities of triggering climate tipping points under five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and how they are altered by including the additional carbon emissions that could arise from tipping points within the Earth's carbon cycle. The crossing of a climate tipping point at a threshold level of global mean surface temperature (threshold temperature) would commit the affected subsystem of the Earth to abrupt and largely irreversible changes with negative impacts on human well-being. However, it remains unclear which tipping points would be triggered under the different SSPs due to uncertainties in the climate sensitivity to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, the threshold temperatures and timescales of climate tipping points, and the response of tipping points within the Earth's carbon cycle to global warming. We include those uncertainties in our analysis to derive probabilities of triggering for 16 previously identified climate tipping points within the Earth system. To conduct our analysis, we use the reduced complexity climate model FaIR (Finite amplitude Impulse Response) which is coupled to a conceptual model of the tipping processes within the Amazon rainforest and permafrost, which are the two major tipping points within the Earth's carbon cycle. Uncertainties are propagated by employing a Monte Carlo approach for the construction of large model ensembles. We find that carbon tipping points increase the risk for high-temperature pathways, but on average their warming effect remains small, with its median staying 1 order of magnitude lower than the median anthropogenic warming for all SSPs. Therefore, they have low potential to increase the probability of triggering other tipping points. The maximum triggering probability increase from carbon tipping points among all SSPs occurs under SSP2-4.5, with a 3 percentage point increase averaged over all tipping points. The warming trajectory expected from current policies compares best to SSP2-4.5, which we find to be unsafe with regard to triggering climate tipping points. Our most conservative estimate of triggering probabilities averaged over all tipping points is 62 % under SSP2-4.5, and nine tipping points have a more than 50 % probability of getting triggered. Under SSP1-2.6 and SSP1-1.9, the risk of triggering climate tipping points is reduced significantly compared to SSP2-4.5; however, it also remains less constrained since the behaviour of climate tipping points in the case of a temperature overshoot is still highly uncertain.

The majority of people are going under, and at the end of the day you only have human overexpansion to blame. Sure they’re not building as many homes as they ought to,  but that just masks the underlying math.

mn3pkwc,1jz5wd3,reddit,"**Abstract**

• Background: Older adults can acquire new skills across different domains. Practicing a musical instrument has been identified as a promising activity for improving cognition, promoting well-being, and inducing brain plasticity in older individuals. However, the mechanisms of these changes are still poorly understood. This study aims to assess musical skill acquisition in musically naïve older adults over one year of practice, focusing on individual factors influencing this process and the relations between musical skills.

• Methods: One hundred fifty-six healthy older adults (age = 69.5 years ± 3.2) from Hannover and Geneva with no prior musical training participated in weekly piano practice (PP) or ‘music culture’ (MC) sessions over a one-year period. Baseline assessments included the Cognitive Reserve Index questionnaire (CRIq) and Cognitive Telephone Screening Instrument (CogTel). Musical abilities were measured using piano performance ratings (PP group), music quizzes (MC group), and aptitude tests such as the Beat Alignment Test (BAT), Melodic Discrimination Test (MDT) and Midi Scale Analysis (MSA) at baseline and six-, twelve and 18-month timepoints. The interrelationship between musical abilities was investigated through correlational analyses, and changes impacted through individual characteristics were modeled using Bayesian statistics.

• Results: The PP group demonstrated moderate improvements in piano articulation and dynamics, while the MC group achieved higher scores in the music quiz. Modest improvements in MDT and MSA were observed in both groups, with the PP group showing greater progress is MSA. Higher global cognitive functioning and musical sophistication was associated with greater performance in MDT for both groups. We did not identify any links between individual characteristics, like age, CogTel, CRIq, and musical sophistication, and improvement in musical aptitude tests. Changes in different musical aptitude test scores were not correlated, and neither the development of piano skills nor the music quiz correlated with initial performances on the musical aptitude tests.

• Conclusion: Musically naïve older adults can acquire diverse musical abilities, which progress independently, suggesting a broad spectrum of musical abilities rather than a single general musical aptitude. Future research should also explore genetic and psychosocial factors influencing musical development.

Most of the intermittent fasting studies that have shown efficacy over strict caloric restriction has been primarily in men, rather than women.  Here we have a female predominate group that shows the intermittent fasting group restricted better. So, despite not showing that the effect of fasting helps promote a catabolic state, it does support the idea that intermittent fasting is a more reliable approach to restriction.  This generally supports what i've seen in practice.  Breaking the habits of grazing, eating snacking etc should be the focus of sustainable lifestyle change.

You can plan your week around it a bit or even adjust your eating so you don't begin eating till much later in the day. 

Someone that needs 2500 calories a day would need 17500 a week. Which on eating days would mean 4000 calories needed to maintain. 

Someone who is doing a stricter diet would probably eat closer to maintenance on any given day and thus any ""failure"" day for an occasion or accidentally over eating would be harder to account for. 

The larger deficits on the days you don't eat allow a lot more flexibility and deviation when you do and those small differences over a long period will see a difference. 

Anecdotally the easiest diet I have found to adhere to is based around week blocks of calories. Work out tdee and multiple by 7 and then use that as the base to work out calories in. You need to track which is more effort but it allows a lot of flexibility. The IF model kind of replicates that flexibility without having the need to track cash.

one recent study asserts its dangerous effect (very reactive, easy to enter into living cells, and hard to detect) by utilizing its new technology (OM-SERS Tool) to detect microplastics, and now they are researching.

However, in previous years scientists came up with new techniques to extract nanoplastics from the water, and they extracted 98% of nanoplastics by using special water-repelling solvents made from natural ingredients.

Which might cheer some people; however, there are some countries that can't implement such techniques in their country, for instance India.

India is most polluted country (21 of 30 worst cities especially mumbai)

Check this game out (made by indian youtuber Mohak Mangal) where you are shown the place through Google Maps and you have to tell if the place is contaminated or not.

Source: [https://www.cleanairfund.org/geography/india/](https://www.cleanairfund.org/geography/india/)

This is all due to the failure to implement such laws in india.

In a nutshell, op has provided us with a valuable study where techniques are shared, but i feel there should be more research on nanoplastics as well as microplastics, and lastly, some country might fail to implement the law as i have given the example of India. however i want to make it optimistic above all by saying there will be a time when we will be able to come up with such a solution to it.

Thanks op for sharing this study.

I've always struggled with blood sugar issues and insulin resistance. The most annoying part? All my fat goes straight to my belly which sucks ass. But every time I do keto, that visceral belly fat shrinks and my blood sugar stabilizes - confirmed by actual bloodwork showing my A1C dropping from 5.5 to 4.9 a year later after adding back carbs for a full year.

The quick weight loss is honestly pretty motivating, especially for someone like me who's crashed and burned on slower, traditional diets before.

One major thing I noticed: when I was super strict (like weighing foods to the gram and tracking every carb religiously), I felt amazing - steady energy and great mood all day. But as soon as I started messing with those packaged ""keto"" snacks, breads, and tortillas? Felt like garbage again.

It's definitely not an easy diet to nail, but when you do it right, it's seriously game-changing.

The meta-analysis does not prove that early heart problems cause loss of brain cells; it only shows an association.

“This review shows that better heart health is associated with larger brain volumes, suggesting that the preservation of heart function could help maintain brain health and memory and thinking skills during the aging process,” said meta-analysis author Frank J. Wolters, MD, PhD, of Erasmus University Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. “These results add to the importance of early detection and treatment of heart problems.”

The meta-analysis included seven studies from Europe and the United States with a total of 10,889 participants with an average age of 67. The studies measured early signs of heart problems, including systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Systolic dysfunction is when the left ventricle of the heart can’t contract normally and pump blood efficiently. Diastolic dysfunction is when the left ventricle does not relax properly between heartbeats and fill with blood. The studies also used MRI brain scans to measure brain volumes.

>In one such test, the novel object recognition test, the vitamin K-deficient mice showed a diminished ability to distinguish between familiar and new objects, a clear indication of impaired memory. In a second test, to measure spatial learning, the mice were tasked with learning the location of a hidden platform in a pool of water. The vitamin K-deficient mice took considerably longer to learn the task compared to their counterparts with adequate vitamin K levels.

>When the researchers then examined the mice brain tissue, they found significant changes within the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for learning and memory. Specifically, they observed a reduced number of proliferating cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in the vitamin K-deficient mice. This decrease translated to fewer newly generated immature neurons, a process known as neurogenesis. “Neurogenesis is thought to play a critical role in learning and memory, and its impairment could directly contribute to the cognitive decline observed in the study,” Zheng says.

>Adding another layer of complexity, the researchers also found evidence of increased neuroinflammation in the brains of the vitamin K-deficient mice.

mklhyf6,1jnp1nq,reddit,"From the article: Scientists have debunked the belief that using tools is unique to mammals and birds, after documenting tropical fish that smash shellfish against rocks to open and eat the meat, in a fascinating new study [published](https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1007/s00338-025-02633-w) in the journal Coral Reefs on 26 March 2025.

Dr Juliette Tariel-Adam from the School of Natural Sciences at Macquarie University led a project tracking tool use in multiple species of wrasses — a colourful reef fish.

The study logs fish deliberately picking up hard-shelled prey like crabs and molluscs, smashing them against hard surfaces like rocks to access the meal inside.

“Tool use is typically associated with humans, but this behaviour is proof that fish are far cleverer than they get credit for,” says Dr Tariel-Adam.

The researchers from Australia, Brazil and Caicos Islands have provided the first evidence of anvil use in several species of Halichoeres wrasses, suggest the behaviour is far more common than previously thought.

Wrasses use hard surfaces, also called ‘anvils,’ to crack open hard-shelled prey such as crabs and molluscs. Through a citizen science initiative Fish Tool Use, researchers gathered 16 new observations across five species of Halichoeres wrasses.

These findings mark the first evidence of anvil use for three species and the first video evidence for the other two, and extend the known range of anvil use to the western Atlantic.

“With these newly discovered tool-using species, it becomes clear that many species of wrasses use tools that we previously didn’t know about,” said Dr Tariel-Adam.

Professor Culum Brown, head the Fish Lab at Macquarie University and senior author of the study says the study adds to research into fish intelligence. “They demonstrate flexible and dexterous tool use, expanding our understanding of tool use evolution in the animal kingdom.”",2025-03-30 22:57:40,11,chrisdh79,science

To measure team flow, the participants had to collaborate on the game, each responsible for playing some of the keys. The researchers measured the participants' brain activity using an electroencephalogram (EEG), a noninvasive method using electrodes applied to the head. While the participants were playing the game in a closed room, the researchers would knock on the door. A person in a real flow state would be able to ignore the distractions.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lacks certain authorities and is persistently underresourced to fulfill its mission of protecting the public by ensuring that foods are safe, wholesome, sanitary, and properly labeled. Particularly concerning gaps exist in pre- and postmarket oversight of food ingredients that are often found in ultraprocessed foods. Numerous substances either have evidence of harm or are unknown to the FDA and the public. Additional authorities and resources are necessary. User fees have been successfully implemented to provide resources to the FDA for other programs under its purview. This legal and policy analysis evaluates the FDA’s food-related authorities that would be amenable to a new user fee program. It reviews policy domains where new or enhanced user fees may be warranted. We find that a new comprehensive FDA user fee program for food may benefit industry and generate targeted new resources to strengthen the agency’s oversight.

ml76xgp,1jqipig,reddit,"From the article: The construction industry accounts for nearly 40 per cent of all energy-related emissions worldwide, so the search for eco-friendly insulation materials is critical. NTU’s Associate Professor Hortense Le Ferrand, who led the [study](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2024.115187), said mycelium-bound composites could be a promising alternative.

Assoc Prof Le Ferrand, who holds a joint appointment at NTU’s Schools of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE) and Materials Science and Engineering (MSE), said: “Insulation materials are increasingly integrated into building walls to enhance energy efficiency, but these are mostly synthetic and come with environmental consequences throughout their life cycle. Mycelium-bound composite is a biodegradable material that is highly porous, which makes it a good insulator. In fact, its thermal conductivity is comparable to or better than some of the synthetic insulating materials used in buildings today.""

“We worked closely with bioSEA to integrate natural design principles that can optimise its performance as a building insulator. The result is a promising proof of concept that takes us one step closer to efficient, sustainable, and cheaper passive cooling solutions in hot and humid conditions.”

Dr Anuj Jain, the Founding Director of bioSEA explained the inspiration behind the elephant-linked innovation: “Elephants are large animals that live in hot and sometimes humid tropical climates. To withstand the heat, elephants evolved to develop a skin that is heavily wrinkled which increases water retention and cools the animal by evaporation. We were inspired by how an elephant could cool itself in hot weather without sweat glands, and tried to see how we could replicate the same cooling mechanisms of shading, trapping cool air, and increasing the surface area for water to evaporate.”

mkpyvwy,1jo76yn,reddit,"I've struggled with my mental health off and on throughout my life. Found out at nearly 30, it was due to being autistic. This has left me with a lot of trauma. 

I've been bouncing between therapists for the last several years, desperately trying to find someone who can help. I find one of the issues is that it's simply impossible to find a therapist in my area who has an understanding of autism. The lack of knowledge of autism often leaves me feeling like I'm talking a different language than my therapist. Also, the over reliance on CBT is extremely frustrating because it's simply not that affective on people with autism or those struggling with trauma. In fact, it can be counterproductive, but it feels like it's all some therapists know.

Now, the reasons I'm sharing all this is because I've also explored AI therapists using various models and methods. What I've found is they tend to have a far better grasp of autism, and this often is initially more helpful because of it. You can even set up an AI with specific models of treatment so you aren't stuck with CBT. 

This initially seemed really promising as I could get an AI therapist who understood autism and who could help me explore different modalities of therapy that might be better suited to my personal issues.

However, as time went on, and it didn't take much. I found there was an issue with the whole premise. I couldn't form a connection or trust with the AI therapist. Too many times, there's minor hullicinatory nonsensical outputs. There are too many inconsistencies brought on by the limited context of our current models. 

Bringing things back to my own issues, I'm autistic, and I struggle with trauma. As a result, I often struggle to make connections with people, to feel heard or understood, to feel like I can unmask, and let my guard down. It's hard for me to be authentic around others because doing so has always ended in abuse and bullying.

Again, the issue with therapy AIs for me is that it's impossible to make a human connection with them. They can dispense advice. They can even understand autism. But they can not make me feel understood or seen as a person. Which is what I believe many people need when it comes to therapy. It's not just about reframing bad thoughts, but having an understanding human connection that can support you through that process. 

Which I suppose is why they're stressing the need for oversight. But considering how isolated we are these days, I wonder if this will just put some people in a worse position. Further disconnect us from the human connections we actually need in order to heal.

Sharing a plain language summary for this study ([Convenience or Continuity: When Are Patients Willing to Wait to See Their Own Doctor?](https://www.annfammed.org/content/23/2/151)): 

**Background and Goal:** Although team-based care models, which involve multiple health care professionals working together, can improve access and efficiency, they may also affect continuity of care, which is linked to better health outcomes and stronger patient-physician relationships. This study focuses on how primary care patients balance the trade-off between continuity of care and access to timely appointments. It examines whether patients prefer to wait longer to see their own primary care physician (PCP) or if they are willing to see another clinician for faster care.

**Study Approach:** Researchers analyzed data from the 2022 Patient Well-Being Survey, a cross-sectional online survey of adult primary care patients in Michigan. Patients were presented with scenarios in the survey for different visit types—annual checkups, chronic and mental health follow-ups, new symptoms, and urgent concerns—and asked to choose among three options: see only their PCP, prefer their PCP but willing to see another clinician, or see the first available clinician. The survey included the Person-Centered Primary Care Measure and the What Matters Index to assess patient-centered care and health-related quality of life. 

**Results:** 2,319 questionnaires were included in the analysis. 

* Over one-half of patients preferred their PCP for annual checkups (52.6%), chronic condition follow-up (54.6%), and mental health follow-ups (56.8%).
* Patients were willing to wait 3-4 weeks to see their PCP for sensitive exams (68.2%), new mental health concerns (58.9%), and new concerns about chronic conditions (61.1%).
* Only 7.2% of patients were willing to wait for their PCP for urgent concerns—most preferred the soonest available clinician​.",2025-03-26 16:04:49,18,iamphilosofie,science

mmjezn8,1jwl5o5,reddit,"Just skimmed through the paper and found it interesting since I sometimes use fluorinated surfactants in my work. 

It looks like the key to accomplish the very low surface energy (in solutions) without fluorine is to branched Si-CH3 groups in the hydrophobic chains of surfactants, which the authors call ""hedgehog"" surfactants.

The magnesium salt of one such material (Mg(AOTSiC)2) in particular has a very low surface tension of around 21.5 mN/m at the critical micelle concentration. This value is comparable to that of typical fluorine-based surfactants! When used as a foam stabilizer, the hedgehog surfactant had a similar performance to a fluorine-based surfactant (4FG(EO)2). 

Now the current issue is the cost of synthesizing the compound. The reactant providing Si-CH3 groups (3-(Trimethylsilyl)-1-propanol) has not been mass-produced yet and so is very expensive at the moment. A gram of that material costs $26 ($90 US in my country). This is not the end of the world though, since surfactants are used at low concentrations.",2025-04-11 10:18:26,73,PM_ME_ZED_BARA,science
mmj5zvf,1jwl5o5,reddit,"Until now, it was believed fluorine – the element in such products which forms a highly effective barrier between substances like air and water, making them water repellent – could not easily be replaced because of its unique properties.

But scientists, from the University of Bristol in the UK, Hirosaki University, Japan, and Université Côte d’Azur, France have discovered that the unique ‘bulky’ attribute of fluorine, which makes it especially good at filling space, can actually be replicated in a different, non-toxic form.

Co-lead author Professor Julian Eastoe, from the University of Bristol School of Chemistry, said: “From fire-fighting foam to furniture, food packaging and cookware, to make-up and toilet tissue, PFAS products are everywhere. Despite the risks to human health, and the fact they don’t degrade, perfluoroalkyl substances persist in the environment, finding an alternative with comparable properties has proven elusive. But after many years of intensive research, we’ve made a great breakthrough.”

The results of their discovery are published in a study, which unpacks the chemical structure of PFAS and pinpoints the characteristic ‘bulkiness’ they sought to replicate in a safer form. It also demonstrates how non-fluorinated components, containing only non-toxic carbon and hydrogen, could be equally effective replacements.

mk6nfil,1jlvlfr,reddit,"From the press release:

As little as five minutes a day of eccentric exercise could offer significant health benefits to those living a stagnant lifestyle, researchers from Edith Cowan University (ECU) found.


The study, led by Dr Benjamin Kirk and Professor Ken Nosaka in ECU's School of Medical and Health Sciences, evaluated the effects of a five-minute a day, home-based bodyweight eccentric exercise program on physical fitness, body composition, and both physical and mental health in sedentary individuals.

Over a four-week period, the participants completed daily exercise consisting of 10 repetitions each of chair squats, chair reclines, wall push-ups, and heel drops focusing on eccentric - muscle lengthening contractions, by slowly stretching contracting muscles such as sitting to a chair slowly in which the front thigh muscles are lengthened while supporting the body weight.

""We saw significant improvements in muscle strength, flexibility, strength endurance and mental health, suggesting that even small amounts of daily exercise can provide sustainable and detectable benefits in sedentary individuals,"" Professor Ken Nosaka said.

""The results highlighted that eccentric exercises are very effective in improving fitness. This type of exercise is also more accessible to most people, as it makes use of body weight and eliminates the need to go to a gym.

mngq7ov,1k0tju2,reddit,"**Abstract**

Despite being pivotal to the habitability of our planet, the process by which Earth gained its present-day hydrogen budget is unclear. Due to their isotopic similarity to terrestrial rocks across a range of elements, the meteorite group that is thought to best represent Earth's building blocks is the enstatite chondrites (ECs). Because of ECs' nominally anhydrous mineralogy, these building blocks have long been presumed to have supplied negligible hydrogen to the proto-Earth. However, recent bulk compositional measurements suggest that ECs may unexpectedly contain enough hydrogen to readily explain Earth's present-day water abundance. Together, these contradictory findings mean the contribution of ECs to Earth's hydrogen budget is currently unclear. As such, it is uncertain whether appreciable hydrogen is a systematic outcome of Earth's formation. Here, we explore the amount of hydrogen in ECs as well as the phase that may carry this element using sulfur X-ray absorption near edge structure (S-XANES) spectroscopy. We find that hydrogen bonded to sulfur is prevalent throughout the meteorite, with fine matrix containing on average almost 10 times more Hsingle bondS than chondrule mesostasis. Moreover, the concentration of the Hsingle bondS bond is linked to the abundance of micrometre-scale pyrrhotite (Fe1-xS, 0 < x < 0.125). This sulfide can sacrificially catalyse a reaction with H2 from the disk at high temperatures to create H2S, which could be dissolved in adjoining molten silicate-rich material. Upon rapid cooling, this assemblage would form pyrrhotite encased in submicron silicate-rich glass that carries trapped H2S. These findings indicate that hydrogen is present in ECs in higher concentrations than previously considered and could suggest that this element may have a systematic, rather than stochastic, origin on our planet.

mo9unsr,1k4gsm8,reddit,"When smoke from Canadian wildfires turned New York City skies apocalyptically orange in June 2023, it delivered catastrophic air quality and an unexpected side effect: cooling the New York City region by about 3 degrees Celsius.

This temperature drop, called “global dimming,” which is the opposite of “global warming,” trapped dangerous pollutants near the ground, according to Rutgers Health researchers who published their breakthrough findings in Nature's Communications Earth & Environment.

“With all you hear about the negative consequences of global warming, you might think the cooling would be good,” said Philip Demokritou, senior study author and Henry Rutgers chair and professor of nanoscience and environmental bioengineering at the Rutgers School of Public Health and the School of Engineering. “But cooler temperatures are equally bad as global warming. This effect on microclimate can disrupt the hydrological cycle, trap other toxic air compounds and increase human exposure levels.”

School sports tournaments and club activities across Japan may need to be canceled for much of the summer by the 2060s as climate change pushes heat levels beyond safe limits, according to a joint study by the National Institute for Environmental Studies and Waseda University.
Millions of students across the country participate in school sports clubs, and thousands of heat-related illnesses have been reported almost every year since 2018.

Current Environment Ministry guidelines call for halting strenuous outdoor activities when the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) remains below 28 degrees Celsius for less than two hours (referred to as Heat Level 1) and stopping all activities, indoors or outdoors, when it remains below 31 C for less than two hours (referred to as Heat Level 2). The WBGT is a measure that combines heat, humidity, wind and sunlight.

However, the study shows those thresholds could be reached much more frequently in the future, especially in regions that are already warm. The study warned that, in the coming decades, nearly three-quarters of the country could face conditions in which intense physical activities should be suspended for months at a time.

To think that there's a chance we could possibly transplant a temporary liver until a human one becomes available would be a huge game changer. Most of my patients die waiting for a liver as healthy organs are a precious commodity. ESLD is arguably the worse way to die as it is a slow, excruciating disease process once decompensation develops. 


Once a patient develops ESLD, all we can do really is prevent further complications. We can't treat the chronic pain that comes with the disease as the liver can no longer process pain medications as the majority are hepatotoxic. Even Tylenol and NSAIDs are contraindicated for liver patients.

Abstract:

>Coffee is one of the most consumed beverages in the world. However, issues such as climate change threaten the growth of the temperature-sensitive Coffea arabica plant, more commonly known as Arabica coffee. Therefore, it is crucial to make beverages more efficient by using less coffee while still meeting the high demand for the beverage. Here, we explore pour-over filter coffees, in which a water jet impinges on a water layer above a granular bed. To reveal its internal dynamics, we first substitute opaque coffee grounds with silica gel particles in a glass cone, imaged with a laser sheet and a high-speed camera. We discover an avalanche effect that leads to strong mixing at various pour heights, even with a gentle pour-over jet. We also find that this mixing is not significantly impacted by a layer of floating grains, which is often present in pour-overs. Next, we perform experiments with real coffee grounds to measure the extraction yield of total dissolved solids. Together, these results indicate that the extraction of the coffee can be tuned by prolonging the mixing time with slower but more effective pours using avalanche dynamics. This suggests that instead of increasing the amount of beans, the sensory profile and the strength of the beverage can be adjusted by varying the flow rate and the pour height. In this way, the extraction efficiency could be better controlled to help alleviate the demand on coffee beans worldwide.",2025-04-08 17:23:57,6,Hrmbee,science

mnl34fa,1k1b2g2,reddit,As someone who has anxiety it's really interesting to see that the fear of internal feelings and sounds of your bodys internal functions is a very common anxiety symptom. It's nice to see they are actually researching into it,2025-04-17 13:55:12,60,PhotoBN1,science
mnkka8p,1k1b2g2,reddit,"From the article: A new study [published](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejn.16672) in the European Journal of Neuroscience has found that moment-to-moment feelings of anxiety are related to reduced insight toward breathing-related bodily sensations, and that this link appears to be specific to women. The researchers found that while men and women had similar abilities to detect subtle changes in their breathing, greater anxiety was associated with lower confidence and reduced insight into performance accuracy—but only in women.

The study was motivated by growing evidence that anxiety is connected to interoception—the awareness of internal bodily states such as breathing, heartbeat, or hunger. Interoception is thought to play a central role in how the brain monitors and regulates physical and emotional states. Previous studies have suggested that people with anxiety may struggle with interoceptive awareness, particularly when it comes to how well they can evaluate or trust their perceptions of bodily signals. However, much of the earlier research was based on small samples, and few studies examined whether these relationships differ between men and women.

“Women have a much higher prevalence of anxiety than men, and the symptom presentation is often quite different,” said study author Olivia Harrison, a Rutherford Discovery Research Fellow and senior lecturer at University of Otago. “We are interested in how signals from within the body (interoception) are altered with anxiety differentially between men and women. We are also interested in whether this may be due to differences in early perceptual processing of these signals, or whether gender differences may only become apparent during metacognition – awareness and insight into one’s interoceptive processing.”",2025-04-17 12:03:49,23,chrisdh79,science

The study, led by the University of Bristol, found extreme heat could result in nearly 100 (98) deaths across the nation per year, with between two-thirds and three-quarters of these occurring rural areas. The more localised findings focused on towns across Northern Ireland, including Castlederg in County Tyrone, that holds the record for Northern Ireland’s hottest and coldest temperatures.

Lead author Dr Alan Kennedy-Asser, Senior Research Associate at the University of Bristol from Moira, in County Down, Northern Ireland, said: “Our research highlights the importance of understanding the local setting in which weather and climate impacts occur. With further global warming, other parts of Northern Ireland can expect to see the temperatures previously recorded in Castlederg, so we can learn a lot from the local experts within communities who have experienced these extremes first-hand.”

Rather than being due to acute heat stress, the forecasted deaths would be from a range of causes, for example increased cardiovascular or respiratory complications during warm periods.

mm1jg9o,1juf5wp,reddit,"From the article: The Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute (KERI) and the Korea Institute of Materials Science (KIMS) have [jointly developed](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1385894725009647?via%3Dihub) the 'spray drying technology-based high-performance dry electrode manufacturing technology' for the realization of high-capacity secondary batteries.

Secondary battery electrodes are made by mixing 'active materials' that store electrical energy, 'conductive additives' that help the flow of electricity, and 'binders' which act as a kind of adhesive. There are two methods for mixing these materials: the 'wet process', which uses solvents, and the 'dry process', which mixes solid powders without solvents. The dry process is considered more environmentally friendly than the wet process and has gained significant attention as a technology that can increase the energy density of secondary batteries. However, until now, there have been many limitations in achieving a uniform mixture of active materials, conductive additives, and binders in dry process.

To solve this problem, KERI and KIMS applied the 'spray drying' technology, which has already been proven for mass production in the food and pharmaceutical industries, to the dry process. First, the researchers at KIMS mixed the active materials and conductive additives in a liquid slurry form and then sprayed them into a high-temperature chamber made of glass tubes. The principle is that the solvent evaporates instantly due to the high temperature inside the chamber, leaving only a uniformly mixed composite powder of active materials and conductive additives. This method is the same process used in the mass production of instant stick coffee, where coffee concentrate is sprayed and hot air is applied to produce solid powder.

The composite powder of active materials and conductive additives made using the spray drying technique was transformed into high-capacity electrodes by the researchers at KERI, who possess extensive know-how and expertise in ‘dry-electrode processes’. The researchers mixed the composite of active materials and conductive additives with binders, then carried out a process called 'fibrillation,' in which the binders are stretched into threads using specially designed equipment. Through this delicate process, the 'active materials-conductive additives-binders' were better woven together as a structure and could be precisely combined. Finally, the researchers went through a 'calendering' process, where the combined active materials, conductive additives, and binders were made into a thin film with uniform density, ultimately producing electrodes for batteries.

KERI and KIMS believe that this achievement will realize high capacity in secondary batteries. Thanks to this, it becomes possible to achieve optimal mixing between the internal materials of the secondary battery, reducing the amount of conductive additives compared to before, and instead filling that space with active materials, which are directly related to battery capacity.",2025-04-08 14:47:50,11,chrisdh79,science

Abstract

Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are rapid, recurring X-ray bursts from supermassive black holes, believed to result from interactions between accretion disks and surrounding matter. The galaxy SDSS1335+0728, previously stable for two decades, exhibited an increase in optical brightness in December 2019, followed by persistent active galactic nucleus (AGN)-like variability for 5 yr, suggesting the activation of a \~106-M⊙ black hole. Since February 2024, X-ray emission has been detected, revealing extreme \~4.5-d QPEs with high fluxes and amplitudes, long timescales, large integrated energies and a \~25-d superperiod. Low-significance UV variations are reported, probably related to the long timescales and large radii from which the emission originates. This discovery broadens the possible formation channels for QPEs, suggesting that they are linked not solely to tidal disruption events but more generally to newly formed accretion flows, which we are witnessing in real time in a turn-on AGN candidate.

As a layman, my first thought is that 300 million years ago this black hole consumed mass to produce the X-rays.  

>in February 2024, a team led by Lorena Hernández-García, a researcher at the Valparaiso University, Chile, began to see bursts of X-rays from Ansky at nearly regular intervals.

A possible explanation for this is that possibly planet sized masses are spiralling in to the black hole, as if the increasing mass is increasing the gravitational pull, and shrinking orbits that were once more stable.",2025-04-12 10:47:35,1,gordonjames62,science

MRE, which combines magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with sound waves, provides researchers with information to create detailed images of varying levels of stiffness in the brain.

> Using factors like blood flow and stiffness components to quantify brain health could help lead to earlier detection of neurological diseases like Alzheimer’s, which currently has no cure. Some studies reveal that people with Alzheimer’s show softening in the hippocampus. One hypothesis is that in early Alzheimer’s, a reduction in blood flow could lead to this change in the brain, Neher says.

mo3ngck,1k3ommp,reddit,"Insomnia is a significant health and quality of life concern for older adults, with up to half of all adults over the age of 65 experiencing insomnia symptoms. In a new study, researchers in the Penn State College of Health and Human Development and at Taipei Medical University analyzed five years of data from older adults in the United States. They found higher levels of both insomnia symptoms and sleep medication use were associated with higher risk of disability a year later. 

Every year a person experienced an incremental increase in insomnia symptoms, their risk for becoming disabled in some aspect of their daily life increased by 20%, according to the researchers. A similar level of risk was associated with increased usage of sleep medications. People who regularly experienced insomnia symptoms and used sleep medication were at the highest risk of disability affecting their daily activities. 

Results of the study, recently published in the journal Sleep, indicate the importance of properly treating insomnia, the researchers said.

“When we evaluated the relationships between disability, insomnia and sleep medication use, we found that as older people used more sleep medication or experienced more insomnia symptoms, they moved more rapidly towards greater disability,” said Orfeu Buxton, Elizabeth Fenton Susman Professor of Biobehavioral Health at Penn State, Social Science Research Institute co-funded faculty and co-author of the study.

The researchers analyzed data from 6,722 participants in the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), which captured a national sample of Medicare beneficiaries over the age of 65. The team used more than 22,000 individual observations from the first five waves of data collection — gathered between 2011 and 2015

mmcu4cm,1jvsyq9,reddit,"Seafaring hunter-gatherers were accessing remote, small islands such as Malta thousands of years before the arrival of the first farmers, a new international study has found.

Published in Nature, the research team – led by Professor Eleanor Scerri of the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology (MPI-GEA) and the University of Malta – found hunter-gatherers were crossing at least 100km of open water to reach the Mediterranean island of Malta 8,500 years ago, a thousand years before the arrival of agricultural practises.

This report documented the oldest long-distance seafaring in the Mediterranean, before the invention of boats with sails – an astonishing feat for hunter-gatherers likely using simple dugout canoes.

At the cave site of Latnija in the northern Mellieħa region of Malta, the research team found the traces of humans in the form of their stone tools, hearths, and cooked food waste.

Small, remote islands were long thought to have been the last frontiers of pristine natural systems.

Humans were not thought to have been able to reach or inhabit these environments prior to the dawn of agriculture, and the technological shift that accompanied this transition.

The findings, published in Environment International, highlight the potential impact of early exposure to air pollution on brain development.

The research showed reduced functional connectivity within and between certain cortical and subcortical brain networks. These networks are systems of interconnected brain structures that work together to perform different cognitive functions, such as thinking, perceiving and controlling movement. These findings are consistent with previous studies suggesting that air pollution may be associated with changes in the functional connectivity of brain networks, particularly in children. However, it is not yet fully understood how air pollution affects the development and maturation of these brain networks.

“We will be able to understand how water moves in and out of Greenland in the next few years,” said first author Kevin Rozmiarek, a doctoral student at the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR) at CU Boulder. “As a major freshwater reservoir, we need to understand how Greenland’s environment is going to change in the future.” 

The findings were published March 14 in JGR Atmospheres.  

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Greenland lost about 55 gigatons of ice and snow between fall 2023 and fall 2024. The island is shedding ice for the 28th year in a row, and scientists estimate that it has lost more than 5 trillion tons of ice since 1992.

There is emerging evidence that diet plays a key contributor to brain health, however, limited studies focused on the association of dietary inflammatory potential with brain disorders. This study aimed to examine the association of dietary inflammation with brain disorders in the UK biobank. The prospective cohort study used data from 2006 to 2010 from the UK Biobank, with the median follow-up duration for different outcomes ranging between 11.37 to 11.38. Dietary inflammatory index and Energy-adjusted dietary inflammatory index \[DII and EDII\] were assessed through plausible dietary recalls. Outcomes included brain disorders (all-cause dementia \[ACD\], Alzheimer’s disease \[AD\], Parkinson’s disease \[PD\], stroke, sleep disorder, anxiety and depression disorder) and brain magnetic resonance imaging measures. Cox proportional-hazard models, restricted cubic spline model \[RCS\], Ordinary least squares regressions, and structural equation models were used to estimate associations. Of 164,863 participants with available and plausible dietary recalls, 87,761 (53.2%) were female, the mean (SD) age was 58.97 (8.05) years, and the mean (SD) education years was 7.49 (2.97) years. Vegetables and fresh fruits show significant anti-inflammatory properties, while low-fiber bread and animal fats show pro-inflammatory properties. The nonlinear associations of DII and EDII scores with ACD, AD, sleep disorder, stroke, anxiety, and depression were observed. Multivariable-adjusted HRs for participants in highest DII score VS lowest DII score were 1.165 (95% CI 1.038–1.307) for ACD, 1.172 (95% CI 1.064–1.291) for sleep disorder, 1.110 (95% CI 1.029–1.197) for stroke, 1.184 (95% CI 1.111–1.261) for anxiety, and 1.136 (95% CI 1.057–1.221) for depression. Similar results were observed with regard to EDII score. Compared with the lowest EDII score group, the highest group showed a higher risk of anxiety, depression, sleep disorder, stroke and dementia. Results from sensitivity analyses and multivariable analyses were similar to the main results. Pro-inflammatory diets were associated with a higher risk of brain disorders. Our findings suggest a potential means of diet to lower risk of anxiety, depression, sleep disorder, stroke, and dementia.

mkupg6k,1jovkst,reddit,"From the press release:



From chronic respiratory problems to cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and dementia, health damage caused by particulate matter air pollution is wide-ranging and serious. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that over six million deaths a year are caused by increased exposure to particulate matter. The chemical composition of these tiny particles in the air, which come from a wide range of both anthropogenic and natural sources, is highly complex. Which particles trigger which reactions and long-term diseases in the body is the subject of intensive research.



This research focuses on particularly reactive components known to experts as oxygen radicals or reactive oxygen species. These compounds can oxidize biomolecules inside and on the surface of cells in the respiratory tract, damaging them and in turn triggering inflammatory responses that impact the entire body.



Experts previously collected the particular matter on filters and analyzed the particles following a delay of days or weeks. “Since these oxygen-containing radicals react with other molecules so quickly, they should be measured without delay,” says atmospheric scientist Professor Markus Kalberer, explaining the idea behind the study that he and his team recently published in Science Advances.

mn77cit,1jzma7g,reddit,"**Summary**

• Background: Following the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries saw large increases in rates of alcohol-specific deaths, including England. This study aimed to examine whether there have been changes in the characteristics of those dying by specific cause of death, age, sex, and area-level deprivation.

• Methods: Using annual mortality data in England published by the Office for National Statistics, we describe the prevalence and 95% CI of age-standardised rates of alcohol-specific deaths overall and by age, sex, area-level deprivation measured by quintiles of the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), and cause of death between 2001 and 2022. We also compared demographic profiles of those dying before the COVID-19 pandemic (2017–19) and after (2020–22); calculated crude absolute differences in rates and relative rate ratios across age, sex, and IMD; and used a multivariable Poisson regression model to calculate the rate ratio and adjusted absolute differences for deaths by IMD quintile for each period, adjusting for age and sex.

• Findings: Age-standardised rates of alcohol-specific deaths in England remained largely unchanged until 2019, before rising sharply by 19·4% in 2020 and continuing to rise by a further 13·5% to the highest level on record in 2022: 14·7 (95% CI 14·4–15·0) per 100 000 people. There were few relative demographic changes in alcohol-specific mortality between 2017–19 (pre-pandemic) and 2020–22 (after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic) because the largest absolute increases in alcohol-specific mortality were seen among groups that had the highest pre-pandemic rates, including men (absolute rate increase, 3·87; relative increase, 25·9%) and those from areas of higher deprivation (absolute rate increase, 4·72; relative increase, 22·5%). When examining causes of deaths, the largest absolute increase was in alcohol-related liver disease (2·37; relative increase, 27·2%), with the largest relative increase in acute causes (absolute rate increase, 0·49; relative increase, 35·4%), although these accounted for a smaller proportion of deaths compared to alcohol-related liver disease. There was little to no change in deaths from alcohol dependence syndrome (absolute rate increase, 0·02; relative increase, 5·8%).

• Interpretation: Alcohol-specific deaths in England remain high and increased after the COVID-19 pandemic. Policies should aim to reduce rates of alcohol consumption at the population level. Substantial investment is also required to facilitate early detection of liver disease and effective treatment.

mkuw1gs,1jowf4o,reddit,"A new study published in the journal Cognitive, Affective, & Behavioral Neuroscience reveals that people who hold strong moral convictions about political issues make decisions more quickly—but that these choices are shaped by both emotional brain responses and metacognitive ability. The research shows that moral conviction activates specific brain regions involved in emotion and cognitive control, and that people with lower self-awareness about their own decision accuracy show stronger brain responses to morally charged political issues.

The findings help explain why deeply moralized political beliefs can feel so non-negotiable. When people see political positions as morally right or wrong, they not only respond more quickly but also engage brain systems associated with salience, conflict monitoring, and goal-driven thinking. But this fast, confident decision-making comes with a caveat: people who are less able to distinguish between correct and incorrect judgments—a trait known as low metacognitive sensitivity—appear to rely more heavily on these moral signals in the brain. This could help explain why some individuals become more rigid or dogmatic in their political beliefs.

Our new study published in PLOS Medicine from the COPSAC2010 cohort shows that what mothers eat during pregnancy shapes their child’s brain development.

We tracked 700 mother-child pairs from pregnancy to age 10 - with detailed clinical, genetic, and growth data at 15 timepoints.

Children born to mothers who followed a nutrient-rich, varied dietary pattern during pregnancy had:

> Larger head sizes (a proxy for brain growth)  

> Faster head growth (from fetal life to age 10)  

> Higher IQ scores (at age 10)

On the other hand, children born to mothers consuming a Western dietary pattern high in sugar, fat, and processed foods had:

>Smaller head sizes (a proxy for brain growth) 

>Slower brain growth (from fetal life to age 10)  

>Lower cognitive performance (at age 2)

Breastfeeding also played an independent role in promoting healthy brain growth, regardless of diet during pregnancy. 

What makes this study different? 

1. Tracked brain growth from fetal life to age 10 with 15 head measurements, and accounted for other anthropometrics measures in our modelling of head circumference

2. Combined food questionnaires with blood metabolomics for better accuracy in dietary assessments

3. Showed that genes and nutrition interact to shape brain development",2025-04-10 19:53:01,73,Dlghorner,science

mmix002,1jw6m9b,reddit,"Thoughts on this in what for me is the middle of the night. I can’t see a cranial circumference study without immediately thinking of that fabulous book by Stephen Jay Gould, “The Mismeasure of Man” discussing the people who promoted the pseudoscience of craniometry as a way to unconsciously(?) promote eugenics. Absolutely NOT saying this study was that poorly done or laden with that level of bias. But if you like critical but responsible science journalism and haven’t read the book, it’s very well written and very accessible. 

In complete honesty though, I’m not sure what this really adds to anything. Generously, we have (re)established that allegedly better nutrition means allegedly healthier children, at least to some extent, at least as measured by head growth, and assuming that head physical measurements can be used as an accurate metric of overall “health” and assuming that this doesn’t even out as kids age up into adulthood. 

Of course, our definition of “better” nutrition in this or any context is in flux, and this study notwithstanding is likely to remain so for decades to come, to say the least. Further, this is a correlational study based in part on self-report in a context where even unconscious bias is likely to be high. And, it would be nigh-on impossible to account for all the confounding factors, the biggest one of which is economic: people who can afford more varied diets and who can afford for mommy to support a human parasite until kiddo is a toddler are by-and-large richer. And having richer parents means having all sorts of other advantages including less exposure to pollution, stress, and other acute and chronic environmental hazards, and better access to education, exceptional resources, and other such privileges. The study at least reinforces what we think we already know, to the extent that the conclusions survive the inherent flaws of all such large scale correlational studies. 

I am concerned, however, that what this will be, to the extent that it moves the needle much at all, is a convenient ammo load in the western war on women. Presumably not the intention here, but women are under an incredible amount of pressure to be “perfect” mothers. And if they have a child who isn’t perfect, much less one with a disability, the conventional wisdom is that they must have caused it. Health bigotry is not new. The ugly stench of eugenics that came with Morton (the craniometry guy exposed in Gould’s book) never really left, even after the holocaust. We are now much more militant about shaming people (women) who are not perfect mothers and who have children who are less than perfect. 

Health and disease, illness, and disability are complicated and cannot all be laid at the doorstep of the perfect diet. And yet we try so desperately to do exactly that. The boob fascists alone are awful. Not breastfeeding until the child is old enough to make a sandwich without help is allegedly responsible for everything from aberrant criminal behavior on down through every common illness. And, goes the faulty logic, any woman who cannot, or does not choose, to do this is therefore an inferior mother responsible for creating an inferior child. It’s BS, of course, but breastfeeding has become a false metric for parenting quality. 

So, yet another study focusing on food intake with a not-incredibly-remarkable conclusion on a subject that has been addressed over and over and over, will ultimately be used to “prove” that if women were truly good mothers they would have had perfectly healthy children. Which in turn leads this same cohort to the idea that inferior women are inferior mothers who have inferior children, and we all know the hellish result of that idea. 

It presumably wasn’t the ultimate goal of the study, and we all know that fads drive funding, but I would love to see some research on developmental health that does not ultimately accidentally play into modern eugenic and misogynistic narratives.",2025-04-11 07:09:28,14,Character_Goat_6147,science

Recycling uses up so many more resources, between transport, sorting, cleaning, energy and water.  If we were being responsible about all of the resources used to recycle we should use the bottle and dispose of it as close to the place it was used as possible.  Plastic recycling programs are simply a tool used by plastic producers to minimize the guilt of one-use plastics.  If you truly care about the environment, pollution or waste then your best option is ""Reduce"" followed by ""Reuse"" and with plastic just throw it away - the faster it gets to the landfill the better.

mmfajfq,1jw3xiw,reddit,"From the article: Only 9.5% of plastic materials produced globally in 2022 were manufactured from recycled materials. The findings, reported in Communications Earth & Environment, are part of a comprehensive analysis of the global plastics sector, which also reveals a large increase in the amount of plastic being disposed of by incineration and substantial regional differences in plastic consumption.

Plastic production has increased from two million tonnes per year in 1950 to 400 million tonnes per year in 2022 and is projected to reach 800 million tonnes per year by 2050. As a result, plastic pollution is a pressing and growing global issue, posing major challenges for the environment, economy, and public health. However, there is currently little comprehensive analysis of the contemporary global plastics sector.

Quanyin Tan and colleagues conducted an [analysis](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02169-5) of the global plastics sector in 2022, using data from national statistics, industry reports, and international databases to produce a detailed global and regional overview of plastic production, use, and disposal. Data from their analysis highlights key trends in the global plastic supply chain. Of the 400 million tonnes of plastic produced over the year, just under 38 million tonnes (9.5%) was produced from recycled plastic. 98% of the remaining 362 million tonnes was produced from fossil fuels, predominantly coal and oil.

Around 268 million tonnes of plastic was disposed of over the year, with only 27.9% sent for sorting and potential recycling — 36.2% was instead sent directly to landfill and 22.2% was sent directly to incineration. Additionally, only half of the sorted plastic was actually recycled, with 41% of the sorted plastic instead incinerated and 8.4% sent to landfill. However, the total percentage of global plastic waste sent to landfill in 2022 (40%) has still decreased significantly compared to the estimated 79% of all global plastic waste sent to landfill between 1950 and 2015. The USA had the highest per capita plastic consumption, with an average of 216 kg of plastic consumed per person per year, whilst China consumed the most plastic overall — 80 million tonnes per year.

mn0zyrx,1jytcjm,reddit,"ECU research finds gestational diabetes linked to ADHD in children
An Edith Cowan University (ECU) study has found children born to mothers who experienced gestational diabetes (GDM) during pregnancy are more likely to develop attention-deficient hyperactive disorder (ADHD) and externalising behaviour.

The research by ECU Honorary researcher Dr Rachelle Pretorius and Professor Rae-Chi Huang examined data from 200,000 mother-child pairs across Europe and Australia, and found that in children aged 7 to 10, those born to mothers with gestational diabetes had consistently higher ADHD symptoms.

Children aged 4 to 6 years, born to mothers with gestational diabetes consistently exhibited more externalising problems than those born who didn’t.

""Externalising symptoms are behaviours directed outward. Instead of experiencing depression or anxiety, these children often display hyperactivity, impulsivity, defiance, or aggression,"" Dr. Pretorius explained.

""Externalising problems frequently coexist with ADHD symptoms and tend to emerge before medical intervention, especially during the early school, she added. years.

“At younger ages, children may exhibit more externalising problems and as the child matures, symptoms or behaviour related to ADHD may become more apparent. ADHD does not have biological markers for diagnosis, making ADHD a disorder that is difficult to detect before symptoms manifest,” Professor Huang said.

It is still unclear why children exposed to gestational diabetes retained more externalising problems and ADHD symptoms respectively after adjustments.

“However, our findings suggest that these externalising behaviours may decrease over time but could extend into other domains such as neurodevelopment outcomes such as ADHD symptoms.”

Dr Pretorius noted that while the exact mechanics of gestational diabetes influence on child development is still unclear, it is believed that acute and chronic maternal inflammation during pregnancy may influence certain pathways in a child's brain programming in-utero and contribute to neurodevelopment, cognitive and behaviour outcomes later in life.

mof1wa9,1k54p8e,reddit,"From the article: Reducing high blood pressure substantially lowers the risk of dementia and cognitive impairment without dementia, according to the results of a phase 3 clinical trial involving almost 34,000 patients, published in [Nature Medicine](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03616-8). These findings highlight the potential importance of widespread adoption of more intensive blood pressure control among patients with hypertension to reduce the global disease burden of dementia.

It is estimated that the global number of people with dementia will rise from 57.4 million in 2019 to 152.8 million by 2050, with the greatest impact being in low- to middle-income countries. Previous research suggests that lifestyle interventions, such as eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly, could be the most effective way to reduce the growing global incidence of dementia. Research has also found that people with untreated hypertension have a 42% greater risk of developing dementia in their lifetime than healthy study participants. However, only a few randomized controlled trials have tested the effect of medications that reduce blood pressure on the risk of dementia, and none have looked at it as a primary trial endpoint.

Jiang He and colleagues tested the effectiveness of an intervention led by non-physician community healthcare providers (sometimes called “village doctors”) on blood pressure control, all-cause dementia and cognitive impairment in 33,995 patients with hypertension across villages in rural China. Patients were 40 years of age or older, based in rural China and had untreated hypertension. In the intervention group, 17,407 patients received anti-hypertensive medication and health coaching on home blood pressure monitoring, lifestyle changes (including weight loss, dietary sodium reduction and alcohol reduction) and medication adherence. Those in the control group (also referred to as the usual care group) were trained in blood pressure management and had their blood pressure measured in a healthcare setting. Over 48 months, the authors found that the intervention group achieved better blood pressure control, with more patients reaching target levels, than the control group. Intensive blood pressure management substantially reduced the risk of all-cause dementia by 15% and that of cognitive impairment by 16%.

The findings suggest that proven interventions aimed at reducing blood pressure could help to reduce the global incidence and impact of dementia, and that this intervention should be widely adopted and scaled up to reduce the global burden of dementia.",2025-04-22 12:09:57,7,chrisdh79,science

mndo4my,1k0fxhi,reddit,"Rising seas are already affecting coastal communities in Aotearoa New Zealand. On a global average, the sea level is now 18 centimetres higher than it was in 1900, and the annual rate of increase has been accelerating to currently 4.4 millimetres per year.

This may not seem much, but it is already amplifying the impact of storm and tidal surges. Over the coming decades and centuries, this will pose increasingly serious problems for all coastal communities.

But this is not the end of our troubles. Some parts of New Zealand’s coastline are also sinking. In many New Zealand cities, shorelines are steadily subsiding, with growing impacts on coastal infrastructure.

Our new research reveals where and how fast this is happening. We found the coastlines near all major cities in New Zealand are sinking a few millimetres each year, with some of the fastest rates in coastal suburbs of Christchurch, where the land is still adjusting to the impact of the 2011 earthquake.

Relative increase in sea level
Sea-level rise is happening globally because the ocean is expanding as it continues to warm and glaciers and polar ice sheets are melting.

Meanwhile, land subsidence operates on regional or local scales, but it can potentially double or triple the effects of sea-level rise in certain places. This dual effect of rising seas and sinking land is know as relative sea-level rise and it gives coastal communities a more accurate projection of what they need to prepare for.

mmkncmy,1jwrwpe,reddit,"From the article: Researchers have successfully developed nerve grafts, currently being trialed as a treatment for Parkinson’s disease, that are invisible to the body’s immune system, according to a [new study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1934590925000980?via%3Dihub). It could mean risky post-transplant anti-rejection drugs are soon a thing of the past.

With ongoing advances in medical technology, cell therapy using stem-cell-derived products is becoming a realistic prospect for treating many diseases. That includes Parkinson’s disease, where preclinical and clinical studies have evaluated the use of nerve, or neural, grafts.

A big problem with introducing grafts into the body is that they’re considered foreign objects, and unless anti-rejection drugs are given, the immune system targets them. Now, research led by The Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health (The Florey) in Australia has developed an ingenious way of avoiding that problem.

“Parkinson’s disease causes specific nerve cells – neurons – to die, leading to symptoms that include difficulties moving, tremor, stiffness, and impaired balance,” said Florey Deputy Director Professor Clare Parish, Head of the Stem Cells and Neural Development Group and the study’s lead author. “Neural grafting is an emerging treatment to replace those dead neurons.

“Human neural graft trials are underway overseas but, as with other types of organ or cell transplants, patients need to stop their body rejecting the graft by taking immunosuppressant drugs several times a day. Unfortunately, these drugs carry their own risks and side effects.”",2025-04-11 14:58:47,8,chrisdh79,science

Siqi Yuan et al. ,Autism-like atypical face processing in Shank3 mutant dogs. *Sci. Adv*. 11,eadu3793(2025). DOI: [10.1126/sciadv.adu3793](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adu3793)


From the press release:


A new study has revealed that Beagle dogs carrying mutations in the Shank3 gene—a high-risk gene for autism spectrum disorder (ASD)—exhibit face processing abnormalities similar to those observed in human ASD patients.



The research, published on April 3 in Science Advances, was led by Prof. ZHANG Yongqing from the Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology (IGDB) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Prof. HAN Shihui from Peking University.



ASD is a complex group of neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by social impairments and repetitive behaviors. Human social interactions heavily rely on the ability to accurately process facial information, and abnormalities in this cognitive function are considered a key contributor to the social deficits seen in ASD patients. Although numerous ASD-associated risk genes have been identified, it remains unclear whether specific genetic mutations can directly cause impairments in face processing.



To investigate this question, the research team developed a face-based social preference test to assess face recognition behavior in Shank3 mutant dogs compared to their wild-type counterparts. The results showed that mutant dogs exhibited a reduced preference for facial stimuli and lacked the typical inclination toward conspecific faces—faces of the same species—indicating deficits in face-related social behavior.



To further examine visual attention to faces, the researchers employed eye-tracking technology. They confirmed that Shank3 mutant dogs showed significantly reduced attention to faces, with a notable decrease in gaze directed at the eye region of human faces.



The team also used electrocorticography (ECoG) to record brain activity, revealing that Shank3mutant dogs exhibited both a diminished amplitude and delayed response in the face-specific N1 brainwave component, which typically occurs around 100 milliseconds after presentation of facial stimuli.



In another experiment, the researchers explored the dogs' ability to categorize different types of faces—such as by species and breed—using the repetition suppression paradigm, a widely accepted method in human studies. Wild-type dogs were able to distinguish between facial categories, showing an earlier response to faces of other species and a later response to conspecific faces. In contrast, Shank3 mutant dogs displayed deficits in face categorization.



This study provides direct experimental evidence that mutations in Shank3 lead to ASD-like deficits in face processing, which may contribute to social impairments. Additionally, it establishes a novel experimental model for future research into the genetic and neural mechanisms underlying ASD.",2025-04-05 12:54:38,35,Potential_Being_7226,science

motaqii,1k6wi3m,reddit,"Researchers at University of California San Diego and Wake Forest University have found that both low and moderate-high intensity exercise could be valuable tools in the fight against Alzheimer’s. The new research, published as two papers in Alzheimer’s and Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association, describes the results of the EXERT study (Exercise in Adults with Mild Memory Problems), a multi-site clinical trial of lower or moderate-high intensity exercise in sedentary older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, a major risk factor for Alzheimer’s dementia. The researchers also compared their results to an existing dataset of comparable individuals who only received usual care, such as regular check-ups with health care providers and medication management.

The researchers found:

In EXERT participants, cognitive function remained stable over 12 months in both low and moderate-high intensity exercise groups.


Both forms of exercise were associated with significantly less cognitive decline over 12 months when compared to individuals who were not involved in the exercise study.


Both EXERT exercise groups tended to show less brain volume loss over 12 months, including in the prefrontal cortex.

The actual trial they are talking about tested two different grades of exercise and found no difference on cognition. That’s one paper.

Then in a separate paper, they did a post hoc comparison with a different, external set of patients, from an older study, and found a modestly significant effect versus the patients in the current trial. This set of patients was significantly different, so they tried to use statistical methods to make the comparison fairer.

They write that, “Authorities in areas of recent wildfires, such as the 2025 Los Angeles fires, should ensure that drinking water is safe by monitoring and mitigating contamination in water distribution systems.

“Distribution systems transport drinking water from treatment plants to consumers. Water must meet safety standards before leaving a treatment plant, but contamination can occur during transport.

“Over the past decade, more than 50 volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including carcinogens such as benzene, have been detected in water distribution systems after wildfires

mou5t7z,1k6xnnj,reddit,"> More recently, theorists proposed that excitations that mimic axions and known as the “dynamical axion quasiparticles” could exist under special conditions in certain Earth-based materials. They occur in a new class of lab-created materials — called antiferromagnetic topological insulators. The coherent oscillation of the magnetism in these materials, governed by their topological symmetry — a deep, built-in order in the material that doesn’t change even if it gets stretched or deformed — can simulate axion-like properties.

So, as is tradition, the title is a bit misleading because I was wondering if they had actually detected axions, but no, they found a trick to simulate them. 

Anyway, it's a important work as it may shed light on the behavior of actual axions and help detecting them (if they exist).",2025-04-24 18:52:41,36,DoktorSigma,science

While the Black Death of 1349 then caused devastating losses, with mortality likely to have been approximately 60 per cent of people, the study – recently published in the journal Continuity and Change – shows that Nottingham rebounded faster than historians have previously assumed, thanks to significant migration.

Research on psychopathy among women suggests that the expression of the disorder is not the same as with men, but the behaviors can still be attributed to manipulative and aggressive behaviors, like sexual coercion. High psychopathic women can be coercive, though the strategies tend to be more psychological and emotional manipulation rather than direct violence.

Some studies suggest that power-seeking or dominant women also practice coercive sexuality, but the processes will be varied. Instead of direct force, women’s coercion can be brought about by blackmail, deception, or manipulation of social relationships. But because most of the existing studies have focused on men, further studies would be needed to properly examine if winning or being dominant provokes the same behaviors for psychopathic women.",2025-03-31 20:20:31,5,PMTBAM,science
mkpeafx,1jo6r1l,reddit,"From the article: A new study [published](https://doi.org/10.1002/ab.70025) in Aggressive Behavior provides new insight into how certain personality traits may interact with social dynamics to increase the risk of sexual aggression. The research focused on heterosexual male college students and found that men with elevated levels of callousness and unemotional traits were more likely to send sexually explicit and unwanted content to a woman after winning a competition against another man. 

These findings suggest that feelings of power and dominance following a win may activate sexually aggressive behavior in some men, particularly those with psychopathic tendencies.

The researchers designed the study to address ongoing debates in the field of sexual aggression research, where different theoretical approaches—such as feminist and evolutionary frameworks—have often been treated separately. Feminist theories focus on social power, gender inequality, and cultural norms, while evolutionary perspectives emphasize biological drives and intermale competition.

Both perspectives agree that status plays a role in shaping male behavior, but research has rarely examined how social context and personality traits may jointly contribute to sexual aggression. The goal of the current study was to test whether a simulated status challenge—winning or losing a competition—would influence men’s sexually aggressive behavior, especially among those with psychopathic personality traits.

I remember my uncle had to get a traditional pacemaker after a heart attack, and while it helped, the whole process was invasive and he had to deal with a visible scar, checkups for battery life, and the stress of knowing it would eventually need replacing.

Something like this dissolvable pacemaker could make a huge difference for cases like his if they had that tech back then. It’s way less traumatic, especially for older folks or people who are already dealing with a lot medically. I’m curious how it handles reliability though—like, if it dissolves, what’s the backup if someone suddenly needs longer-term pacing?",2025-04-03 11:44:40,27,Zealousideal_Pay7176,science
ml6xy9d,1jqfyiq,reddit,"From the article: The world’s tiniest known pacemaker, a device smaller than a grain of rice, can be implanted using minimally invasive techniques and dissolves when no longer needed. Researchers described their invention today in the journal [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08726-4).

Pacemakers are implantable devices that electrically stimulate cardiac muscles to control heart rates. Many patients require temporary pacemakers for short-term heart problems, such as slow heart rates during recovery from cardiac surgery.

Conventional temporary pacemakers require invasive surgeries to implant them and then remove the devices. These procedures pose significant risks, such as infection or damage to heart muscles. Such complications are why Neil Armstrong died. He received a temporary pacemaker after a bypass surgery, but when the wires were removed he experienced fatal internal bleeding, says Igor Efimov, a professor of biomedical engineering and cardiology at Northwestern University, in Chicago.

To avoid problems resulting from pacemaker removals, Efimov and his colleagues developed the first dissolvable pacemaker in 2021. Although this quarter-size device performed well in animal experiments, cardiac surgeons asked if it was possible to further miniaturize such pacemakers for pediatric use.

Abstract:

Hydrogen has been promoted as a revolutionary fuel for 50 years, yet usage is confined to oil refining and fertilizer production. For hydrogen to advance global decarbonization, many barriers must be overcome. In this Perspective, we examine the challenges hydrogen faces from production to usage, assessing its environmental and economic credentials, controversies and uncertainties. We provide the evidence base for companies and governments to assess clean hydrogen’s current and potential future competitiveness. Fuel cell cars and space heating are among the least promising applications owing to rapid advances in direct electric alternatives. Hydrogen holds potential in industry, long-duration energy storage and long-haul transport, but its competitiveness depends on large-scale deployment yielding substantial cost reductions. Current production cost estimates range by a factor of five and suggest that targets for 2030 will be difficult to achieve, especially once costs for transport and storage are included. The climate impacts of hydrogen production are also uncertain, with production from electrolysis or methane gas with carbon capture potentially increasing system-wide or upstream emissions, alongside water scarcity and persistent organic pollution. Future research must resolve these uncertainties, with strategic focus on deploying hydrogen in priority areas where it is most competitive.",2025-04-22 16:07:20,5,IainStaffell,science

>
>The team examined exposure to air pollution over an eight to 10 year period (2008-2017) and assessed participants’ memory, executive function (i.e. making plans, solving problems and adapting to new situations), language, and overall cognitive function.
>
>Participants completed a range of well-established neurocognitive memory assessments such as the “East Boston Memory Test” and the “Wechsler Memory Scale”, alongside immediate and delayed recall, backwards counting tasks, and shape drawing.
>
>The findings showed that individuals residing in areas with the highest levels of NO₂ and PM2.5 performed worse on cognitive tests compared to those living in areas with average pollution levels. The most compelling evidence of association was observed in language skills, with individuals in the most polluted areas scoring in the bottom third of the cognitive tests performed.
>
>The study also found that different sources of air pollution have varying effects on cognitive health. For example, pollution from industries, home heating, and combustion of fuels (like coal and oil) were strongly linked to poorer language performance (i.e. the ability to access and produce words quickly).

mnrqd3p,1k274ar,reddit,"Results: HPV vaccination coverage was 82%-83% among women born in 1999-2000. Before 2019, the HPV-16/18 prevalence was highest among the youngest women. During 2020-2023 the prevalence consistently decreased among the birth cohorts offered organized school-based vaccination. There was a 98% decline in HPV-16 prevalence (OR, 0.02 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .01-.04]) and a 99% decline in HPV-18 prevalence (OR, 0.01 [95% CI, .00-.04]) among the 2000-born compared to the 1984-born. The declining HPV-16/18 prevalences resulted in major increases in the NNS to detect and to prevent 1 case of cervical cancer.

Conclusions: The declines of HPV-16/18 were considerably larger than the vaccination coverage, suggesting herd immunity. The changing epidemiology of HPV types impacts screening needs, necessitating updated screening programs.

mokl0az,1k5t780,reddit,"**A novel cable bacteria species with a distinct morphology and genomic potential**

ABSTRACT

Cable bacteria form a group of multicellular prokaryotes that enable electron transfer over centimeter-scale distances within marine and freshwater sediments. To this end, the periplasm of these filamentous bacteria contains specialized conductive fibers, which extend along the full length of each filament and incorporate a novel Ni-containing NiBiD cofactor. Currently, the cable bacteria include two recognized genera, Candidatus Electrothrix and Candidatus Electronema, but the genetic and morphological diversity within the clade remains underexplored. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a novel cable bacteria species from an intertidal estuarine mudflat within Yaquina Bay (Oregon, USA). A clonal enrichment culture of a single strain (designated YB6) was generated, and filaments were subjected to genomic, morphological, spectroscopic, and electrical characterization. Strain YB6 shares key physiological traits with other cable bacteria, such as long-distance electron conduction and the presence of the nickel bis(dithiolene) cofactor. At the same time, YB6 exhibits distinctive morphological features, including pronounced surface ridges that are up to three times wider than in other cable bacteria. Additionally, filaments are extensively enveloped by extracellular sheaths. Genomic analysis reveals that strain YB6 harbors metabolic pathways and genes found in both the Ca. Electrothrix and Ca. Electronema genera. Phylogenetic and phylogenomic analyses indicate that strain YB6 represents a novel species (average nucleotide identity <95%) that forms an early branch within the Ca. Electrothrix clade. The proposed name is Ca. Electrothrix yaqonensis sp. nov., honoring the Yako’n tribe of Native Americans whose ancestral lands encompassed Yaquina Bay.

mlfi0ku,1jrl3ha,reddit,"Exposure to fine particulate air pollution (PM2.5) from wildfire smoke was associated with increased visits to emergency departments (ED) for mental health conditions, according to a new study led by researchers at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

“Wildfire smoke isn’t just a respiratory issue—it affects mental health, too,” said corresponding author Kari Nadeau, John Rock Professor of Climate and Population Studies and chair of the Department of Environmental Health. “Our study suggests that—in addition to the trauma a wildfire can induce—smoke itself may play a direct role in worsening mental health conditions like depression, anxiety, and mood disorders.”

The study was published April 4 in JAMA Network Open.

The study is the first to isolate the short-term impact of wildfire-specific PM2.5, offering more precise insights into its impacts on mental health. A growing body of research suggests that PM2.5 may influence mental health outcomes, but few studies have investigated the effects of wildfire-specific PM2.5. Most studies of wildfire-specific PM2.5 have focused on its relationship to respiratory and cardiovascular outcomes.

The researchers analyzed data on wildfire-specific PM2.5 levels and emergency department visits for mental health conditions throughout California between July and December 2020, a period covering the state’s most severe wildfire season on record. Daily wildfire-specific PM2.5 levels and visits to the ED for mental health conditions—including psychoactive substance use disorders, psychotic disorders, mood-affective disorders, depression, and anxiety—were ascertained for each zip code in the state.

mlj367j,1js263k,reddit,"Abstract: “Opioid overdoses and opioid use disorder (OUD) are major public health concerns. Current treatment approaches for OUD have failed to slow the growth of the opioid crisis. Opioid vaccines have shown pre-clinical success in targeting multiple different opioid drugs. However, the need for many immunizations can limit their clinical implementation. In this study, we investigate the development of novel opioid vaccines by independently targeting fentanyl and the active metabolites of heroin using a bacteriophage virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine platform. We establish the successful conjugation of haptens to bacteriophage Qβ VLPs and demonstrate immunogenicity of Qβ-fentanyl, Qβ-morphine, and Qβ-6-acetylmorphine in animal models after one or two immunizations. We show that these vaccines elicit high-titer, high-avidity, and durable antibody responses. Moreover, we reveal their protective capacities against heroin or fentanyl challenge after two immunizations. Overall, these findings establish Qβ-VLP conjugated vaccines for heroin and fentanyl as promising opioid vaccine candidates.”",2025-04-05 12:21:33,4,bluish1997,science

mn76b4e,1jzm56k,reddit,"Osteoarthritis is the leading cause of disability and chronic pain worldwide, affecting an estimated 595 million people globally. Projections suggest that this number will rise to 1 billion by 2050. Despite its profound impact on individuals and societies, no disease-modifying treatments are currently available. Now, an international team of researchers led by Helmholtz Munich has made new discoveries by studying the genetics of osteoarthritis in nearly 2 million individuals, uncovering hundreds of potential new drug targets and opportunities for repurposing existing treatments.

Ten Percent of Genetic Targets Linked to Approved Drugs
The research team conducted the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) ever performed on osteoarthritis, uncovering over 900 genetic associations. More than 500 of these associations had never been reported before, providing fresh insights into the genetic landscape of the disease. By integrating diverse biomedical datasets, the researchers identified 700 genes with high confidence as being involved in osteoarthritis. Notably, ten percent of these genes encode proteins that are already targeted by approved drugs, opening the door to drug repurposing opportunities that could accelerate treatment development. “With ten percent of our genetic targets already linked to approved drugs, we are now one step closer to accelerating the development of effective treatments for osteoarthritis,"" explains study leader Prof. Eleftheria Zeggini, Director of the Institute of Translational Genomics at Helmholtz Munich and Professor of Translational Genomics at the Technical University of Munich.

In developing the infomorphic neurons, the team was inspired by the way the brain works, especially by the pyramidal cells in the cerebral cortex. These also process stimuli from different sources in their immediate environment and use them to adapt and learn. The new artificial neurons pursue very general, easy-to-understand learning goals: “We now directly understand what is happening inside the network and how the individual artificial neurons learn independently”, emphasizes Marcel Graetz from CIDBN.

mnbumy1,1k07gw3,reddit,"From the article: Valvular heart disease (VHD) is a potentially fatal condition, yet it's difficult to diagnose with a regular stethoscope. A possibly life-saving new multi-sensor stethoscope is claimed to be much better at the job, with the added benefit that it can be used by just about anyone.

VHD occurs when one or more of the heart's four valves don't open or close properly, leading to blood flow issues. According to the American Heart Association, the malady ranks among the highest contributors to global deaths from cardiovascular disease.

Unfortunately, the condition can be quite advanced by the time symptoms become noticeable. Even then, those symptoms are often misdiagnosed as being caused by respiratory ailments – this can happen even when a general practitioner listens to the patient's heart with a conventional single-sensor stethoscope.

Performing an echocardiogram is the best way of diagnosing VHD, but it requires specialized, expensive, hospital-based equipment operated by trained personnel. As a result, patients often have to wait up to several months before they can get tested.

The study investigated if the use of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), varenicline, and bupropion during the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with increased risks of major congenital malformations.

The researchers analysed data from 5.2M births in Australia, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden between 2001 and 2020 - 9300 of these births were exposed to NRT, 3000 to varenicline, and 1000 to bupropion.

They then compared their risk of birth defects to those born to women who smoked in early pregnancy but did not use these quit-smoking tools.

The key finding of the study was that there was no clear increased risk of MCMs associated with prenatal use of NRT and varenicline compared with smoking during the first trimester.

This breakthrough could mark a turning point for future infrastructure in smart cities.

The material is a cement-hydrogel composite developed by a team led by Professor Zhou Yang at Southeast University in China. The team took inspiration from the layered structure inside plant stems to create a material that can harness thermal energy and convert it into electricity.
This new cement material achieves a Seebeck coefficient of −40.5 mV/K and a figure of merit (ZT) of 6.6×10⁻². These values are ten and six times higher, respectively, than what has been recorded with previous cement-based thermoelectric materials.

At this year’s SynBioBeta: The Global Synthetic Biology Conference, a session titled “Conquering Carbon Emissions From the Concrete Industry” will address ongoing challenges in reducing concrete-related emissions. The discussion will highlight how bioengineered materials, such as the newly developed cement composite, could play a pivotal role in advancing sustainable construction.",2025-04-15 10:36:01,0,chrisdh79,science

morczjw,1k6nsqr,reddit,"From the article: In up to 80% of chronic infections, bacteria form biofilms – a slimy substance secreted by the bacteria which forms a protective matrix around them. Biofilms are a major contributor to antimicrobial resistance as they protect bacteria from both human immune cells and antimicrobial drugs, increasing their resistance to treatment by up to 1000-fold. Biofilms are very difficult to remove without mechanically breaking them up, which is not straightforward to do inside the body.

To address this, a team from Oxford's Department of Engineering Science and the Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology, and Musculoskeletal Sciences (NDORMS) have engineered antibiotic-loaded nanoparticles. When activated by ultrasound, these rapidly vaporise and thus both physically disrupt biofilms and release drugs directly at the infection site. Ultrasound can be precisely focused deep inside the body, which is a key advantage for targeting infections non-invasively.

The nanoparticles were tested against 10 clinical bacterial strains, including E. Coli and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), delivering four different antibiotics. With bacteria that did not form biofilms, the combination of the nanoparticles and ultrasound reduced the antibiotic concentration required to prevent their growth by more than 10-fold compared to conventional treatment.

In biofilm infections, the combination was even more effective, reducing the antibiotic concentration needed by more than 40-fold, and eliminating 100% of bacteria at clinically feasible doses. Importantly, the system was highly effective against persister cells - dormant bacteria that are usually able to survive treatment and are thus responsible for infections recurring. It can take a very high dose of antibiotics to kill these cells, which could be dangerous or impossible to give to patients. The nanoparticles reduced the drug concentration needed to eliminate persister cells by 25 fold compared with free antibiotics.",2025-04-24 09:24:22,13,agreenpotato1,science

mmae5oz,1jvhzzr,reddit,"Sections from the news release:

>The map promises to accelerate the study of normal brain function: seeing, storing and processing memories, navigating complex environments. As importantly, it will deepen the study of brain diseases in anatomical and physiological terms — that is, in terms of the wiring and the relationships between circuits and signals. That’s especially promising for diseases that may arise from atypical wiring, such as autism and schizophrenia.
>
>“The technologies developed by this project will give us our first chance to really identify some kind of abnormal pattern of connectivity that gives rise to a disorder,” said Princeton University’s H. Sebastian Seung, the Evnin Professor in Neuroscience and a professor of computer science, who co-led the project.
>
>...
>
>The dataset for the mouse brain is entirely public, meaning researchers across the globe have already started using it to test theories and develop new ways of looking at the brain.
>
>One cubic millimeter of mouse brain is about 20 times bigger than the complete fruit fly brain, and much more complex, but the new map is far from a complete rendering. It represents only about one one-thousandth of a whole mouse connectome.
>
>The leap from partial mouse connectome to full human connectome will take time, resources, and a level of ingenuity that can sometimes seem impossible. Then again, the current map seemed impossible just a few decades ago. Indeed, the researchers said, Francis Crick’s assessment still seemed more or less accurate when the current team started in 2016.
>
>In many ways, one of the key findings to emerge from this project is proof that mapping connectomes is valuable in the first place. J. Alexander Bae, who earned his Ph.D. jointly in electrical engineering and neuroscience, and who worked for many years on this project, said the idea of tracing hundreds of thousands of cells and assembling them into a full 3D reconstruction was truly audacious at the time.

Link to the research article: [Functional connectomics spanning multiple areas of mouse visual cortex](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08790-w#MOESM2)

Abstract:

>Understanding the brain requires understanding neurons’ functional responses to the circuit architecture shaping them. Here we introduce the MICrONS functional connectomics dataset with dense calcium imaging of around 75,000 neurons in primary visual cortex (VISp) and higher visual areas (VISrl, VISal and VISlm) in an awake mouse that is viewing natural and synthetic stimuli. These data are co-registered with an electron microscopy reconstruction containing more than 200,000 cells and 0.5 billion synapses. Proofreading of a subset of neurons yielded reconstructions that include complete dendritic trees as well the local and inter-areal axonal projections that map up to thousands of cell-to-cell connections per neuron. Released as an open-access resource, this dataset includes the tools for data retrieval and analysis. Accompanying studies describe its use for comprehensive characterization of cell types, a synaptic level connectivity diagram of a cortical column, and uncovering cell-type-specific inhibitory connectivity that can be linked to gene expression data. Functionally, we identify new computational principles of how information is integrated across visual space, characterize novel types of neuronal invariances and bring structure and function together to uncover a general principle for connectivity between excitatory neurons within and across areas.

mjufk0a,1jke2b8,reddit,"From the article: In seeking new antibiotic sources, [researchers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167779925000447) have turned to an unlikely source: a whiffy frog known as Odorrana andersonii. By unclumping a compound it produces naturally, they've found a potential gut-friendly ally in the fight against superbugs.

Frogs aren't known for living in the cleanest environments. The mud and muck they typically inhabit are crawling with a pretty impressive range of microbes. Yet the amphibians thrive in a huge range of habits over most of the globe and have done so for millions of years. They've even survived in the Chernobyl exclusion zone, albeit in a bit darker form.

Therefore, thought an international team of researchers, why not investigate them as a source of drugs to combat the growing trend of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

So the group turned to Odorrana andersonii, a frog that is most commonly found in South Asia and emits a strong odor to deter predators. By examining the frog's secretions, the researchers focused on a peptide called Andersonnin-D1 that exhibits antimicrobial action. The issue with the peptide is that it forms clumps when it is secreted, which doesn't make it a good candidate for clinical use.

To solve this, the researchers used a process called ""structure-guided design"" in which they made tiny changes to the peptide's chemical structure until they found a form that resisted clumping and could hold therapeutic promise.",2025-03-26 15:11:29,4,chrisdh79,science

Abstract

Poor sleep health is associated with cardiometabolic disease and related risk factors, including heart disease, stroke, elevated blood pressure and lipid levels, inflammation, glucose intolerance, obesity, physical inactivity, poor diet, unhealthy substance use, poor mental health, and increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, and is associated with social determinants of cardiovascular health and health disparities. Therefore, sleep duration has been recognized by the American Heart Association as one of Life’s Essential 8. Although chronic sleep duration is the sole metric used in Life’s Essential 8, sleep health represents a multidimensional construct. This scientific statement outlines the concept of multidimensional sleep health (sleep duration, continuity, timing, regularity, sleep-related daytime functioning, architecture, and absence of sleep disorders) as it applies to cardiometabolic health. Considerations of how these dimensions are related to cardiometabolic health and patterned by sociodemographic status are explained, and knowledge gaps are highlighted. Additional data are needed to understand better how these various dimensions of sleep should be assessed and how interventions targeting sleep health in clinical and community settings can be leveraged to improve health.

mnkemsm,1k1acia,reddit,"An international team led by the University of Geneva (UNIGE) has discovered the most distant spiral galaxy candidate known to date. This ultra-massive system existed just one billion years after the Big Bang and already shows a remarkably mature structure, with a central old bulge, a large star-forming disk, and well-defined spiral arms. The discovery was made using data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and offers important insights into how galaxies can form and evolve so rapidly in the early Universe. The study is published in Astronomy & Astrophysics.

Large spiral galaxies like the Milky Way are expected to take several billion years to form. During the first billion years of cosmic history, galaxies are thought to be small, chaotic, and irregular in shape. However, the JWST is beginning to reveal a very different picture. Its deep infrared imaging is uncovering surprisingly massive and well-structured galaxies at much earlier times than previously expected – prompting astronomers to reassess how and when galaxies take shape in the early Universe.

A Milky Way Twin in the Early Universe

Among these new findings is Zhúlóng, the most distant spiral galaxy candidate identified to date, seen at a redshift of 5.2 – just 1 billion years after the Big Bang. Despite this early epoch, the galaxy exhibits a surprisingly mature structure: a central old bulge, a large star-forming disk, and spiral arms – features typically seen in nearby galaxies.

‘‘We named this galaxy Zhúlóng, meaning ‘Torch Dragon’ in Chinese mythology. In the myth, Zhúlóng is a powerful red solar dragon that creates day and night by opening and closing its eyes, symbolizing light and cosmic time,’’ says Dr. Mengyuan Xiao, postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Astronomy of the Faculty of Science of UNIGE and lead author of the study.

“What makes Zhúlóng stand out is just how much it resembles the Milky Way in shape, size and stellar mass,” she adds. Its disk spans over 60,000 light-years, comparable to our own galaxy, and contains more than 100 billion solar masses in stars. This makes it one of the most compelling Milky Way analogues ever found at such an early time, raising new questions about how massive, well-ordered spiral galaxies could form so soon after the Big Bang.

Eliminating processed meats from the diet, for example, was associated with the most significant reduction in CHD, which was equivalent to a decrease of 18.5% and 23.8% of CHD cases in women and men, respectively.

Removing processed meat from diet was similarly predicted to reduce the risk of diabetes and colorectal cancer cases by 18.6 and 8.7% in women, respectively, as well as 24.5% and 10.4% in men.

Similar benefits were predicted with guideline-adherent fruit intake. For men and women, increased fruit consumption could reduce the risk of stroke by 19.1% in men and 17.7% in women. Lung cancer rates are also expected to decline if the representative population meets current fruit intake recommendations, with the researchers projecting a reduced risk of 8.2% and 7.2% in women and men, respectively.

mol86bp,1k5wk1f,reddit,"""**Abstract**

**Background**

Protein ingestion stimulates muscle protein synthesis rates (MPS) to support the turnover of skeletal muscle protein mass. However, dietary patterns consist of a variety of protein foods with different amino acid compositions consumed at multiple meal-times throughout the day. Omnivorous (OMN) and vegan (VGN) dietary patterns may differentially stimulate MPS. Moreover, the distribution and frequency of protein intake may also play an important anabolic regulatory role.

**Objective**

We aimed to determine the effect of OMN and VGN dietary patterns and protein distribution (balanced \[B\] and unbalanced \[UB\]) in regulating changes in daily myofibrillar protein synthesis rates during a 9-d resistance training intervention.

**Design**

Forty healthy, physically-active males and females (28 M, 12 F; 25 ± 4 y; BMI = 24.1 ± 2.1 kg·m^(\-2)) consumed a weight-maintenance diet providing 1.1–1.2 g·kg^(\-1)·d^(\-1) of dietary protein from an OMN or VGN dietary pattern with UB (10, 30, 60% of daily protein at meal 1, 2, and 3, respectively) or B (20% of daily protein at 5 eating occasions) distribution. Participants completed whole-body resistance exercise three times during the controlled feeding trial while consuming deuterated water (D2O) for the measurement of daily myofibrillar protein synthesis rates.

**Results**

The %kcals from carbohydrate was higher (_P_ = 0.045) in the OMN compared to VGN groups, but no other differences in dietary intakes were observed. Myofibrillar protein synthesis rates did not differ between OMN-UB (3.04 ± 1.85%·d^(\-1)), OMN-B (2.43 ± 1.21%·d^(\-1)), VGN-UB (2.52 ± 1.77%·d^(\-1)), and VGN-B (2.49 ± 1.56%·d^(\-1)) groups (all _P_ > 0.05).

**Conclusions**

Our results demonstrated that the anabolic action of animal vs. vegan dietary patterns are similar. Moreover, there is no regulatory influence of distribution between the two dietary patterns on the stimulation of myofibrillar protein synthesis rates in young adults. This trial was registered with [ClinicalTrials.gov](http://ClinicalTrials.gov) (NCT04232254).""",2025-04-23 11:15:24,22,James_Fortis,science

Abstract

Skeletal muscle regeneration in adults is predominantly driven by satellite cells. Loss of satellite cell pool and function leads to skeletal muscle wasting in many conditions and disease states. Here, we demonstrate that the levels of fibroblast growth factor–inducible 14 (Fn14) were increased in satellite cells after muscle injury. Conditional ablation of Fn14 in Pax7-expressing satellite cells drastically reduced their expansion and skeletal muscle regeneration following injury. Fn14 was required for satellite cell self-renewal and proliferation as well as to prevent precocious differentiation. Targeted deletion of Fn14 inhibited Notch signaling but led to the spurious activation of STAT3 signaling in regenerating skeletal muscle and in cultured muscle progenitor cells. Silencing of STAT3 improved proliferation and inhibited premature differentiation of Fn14-deficient satellite cells. Furthermore, conditional ablation of Fn14 in satellite cells exacerbated myopathy in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), whereas its overexpression improved the engraftment of exogenous muscle progenitor cells into the dystrophic muscle of mdx mice. Altogether, our study highlights the crucial role of Fn14 in the regulation of satellite cell fate and function and suggests that Fn14 can be a potential molecular target to improve muscle regeneration in muscular disorders.

mkwcnso,1jp35tu,reddit,"The research, published in Environmental Research, provides compelling evidence that childhood exposure to air pollution may have lasting impacts on cognitive development, educational achievement, and mental health.

 

The 11-year longitudinal study, which followed over 1,200 children from birth through to adolescence, identified four distinct patterns of childhood air pollution exposure and their associations with developmental outcomes:

 

Children exposed to consistently high levels of air pollution throughout childhood showed increased likelihood of attention problems and substance abuse in adolescence
Those with high exposure during prenatal and early postnatal periods faced elevated risks of attention problems and substance abuse
Children with elevated air pollution exposure during pre-school years had higher rates of conduct problems, lower educational attainment, and increased substance abuse
These associations remained significant even after controlling for a comprehensive range of family and socioeconomic factors

mmk521o,1jwps8g,reddit,"From the article: Northwestern University researchers have developed the first wearable device for measuring gases emitted from and absorbed by the skin.

By analyzing these gases, the device offers an entirely new way to assess skin health, including monitoring wounds, detecting skin infections, tracking hydration levels, quantifying exposure to harmful environmental chemicals and more.

The new technology comprises a collection of sensors that precisely measure changes in temperature, water vapor, carbon dioxide (CO2) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which each give valuable insight into various skin conditions and overall health. These gases flow into a small chamber within the device that hovers above the skin without actually touching it. This no-contact design is particularly useful for gathering information about fragile skin without disturbing delicate tissues.

The study, [published](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08825-2) in the journal Nature, demonstrates the device’s efficacy across small animals and humans.

“This device is a natural evolution of our lab’s wearable electronic devices that collect and analyze sweat,” said Northwestern’s John A. Rogers, who co-led the study. “In that case, we were analyzing sweat to learn about the wearer’s overall health. While useful, that method requires pharmacological stimulation of sweat glands or exposure to a hot, humid environment. We started thinking about what we could capture from the skin that is naturally occurring all the time. It turns out there are all kinds of things coming off the surface of the skin — water vapor, carbon dioxide and volatile organic compounds — that can be correlated to underlying physiological health.”",2025-04-11 13:24:40,2,chrisdh79,science

mmab0zg,1jvhn6d,reddit,"While some studies have suggested that having a mother with Alzheimer’s disease may put you more at risk of developing the disease, a new study finds that having a father with the disease may be tied to a greater spread of the tau protein in the brain that is a sign of the disease, according to a study published on April 9, 2025, online in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. The study does not prove that having a father with Alzheimer’s results in these brain changes; it only shows an association.

The study also showed that female participants may be more at risk of a heavier buildup of tau protein than male participants.

“We were surprised to see that people with a father with Alzheimer’s were more vulnerable to the spread of tau in the brain, as we had hypothesized that we would see more brain changes in people with affected mothers,” said study author Sylvia Villeneuve, PhD, of McGill University in Montreal, Canada.

The study looked at 243 people who had a family history of Alzheimer’s disease but had no thinking or memory problems themselves at the average age of 68. Family history was defined as one or both parents with the disease or at least two siblings with the disease. Participants had brain scans and took tests of thinking and memory skills at the start of the study and then during the study as they were followed for an average of nearly seven years.

During that time, 71 people developed mild cognitive impairment, which is a precursor to Alzheimer’s disease.

Researchers found that people with a father with Alzheimer’s disease as well as female participants had a greater spread of tau protein in the brain. Female participants also had a heavier buildup of tau protein in the brain.

“Better understanding these vulnerabilities could help us design personalized interventions to help protect against Alzheimer’s disease,” Villeneuve said.

mkok4z8,1jo34fe,reddit,"Generative artificial intelligence has entered a new frontier of fundamental biology: helping scientists to better understand proteins, the workhorses of living cells.

Scientists have developed two new AI tools to decipher proteins often missed by existing detection methods, researchers report March 31 in Nature Machine Intelligence. Uncovering these unknown proteins in all types of biological samples could be key to creating better cancer treatments, improving doctors’ understanding of diseases, and discovering mechanisms behind unexplained animal abilities.

If DNA represents an organism’s master plan, then proteins are the final build, encapsulating what cells actually make and do. Deviations from the DNA blueprint for making proteins are common: Proteins might undergo alterations or cuts post-production, and there are many instances where something goes awry in the pipeline, leading to proteins that differ from the initial genetic schematic. These unexpected, “hidden” proteins have been historically difficult for scientists to identify and analyze. That’s where the machine learning tools come in.

The AI models, called InstaNovo and InstaNovo+, are a step toward “the holy grail” of protein research: to unravel the genetic identity of previously unstudied proteins en masse, says Benjamin Neely, a chemist and protein scientist at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, Md.

• Cholera outbreaks due to drought is an under explored area in current research.

• Most outbreaks studied occurred under a hydrological extreme scenario, like drought.

• Cholera outbreaks were 3.50 times more likely under hydrological extreme conditions.

• Hydrological extremes are predicted to become more frequent with climate change.

• Future predictive models for cholera should incorporate drought as an indicator.

Abstract

Introduction

Increasing aridity and incidence of droughts pose a significant threat to human health, primarily in exacerbating water scarcity, and is projected to become more frequent and severe as a result of related environmental changes in many regions globally. Concomitantly, water scarcity will force populations to utilize potentially contaminated water sources, hence increasing exposure to waterborne diseases, notably cholera. Proliferation of Vibrio cholerae, causative agent of cholera, is driven by environmental factors. Notably, temperature and precipitation have been employed in providing predictive awareness of cholera, allowing early warning and mitigation. The impact of droughts on incidence and spread of cholera is less understood.

Methods

This study aimed to quantify relationships among temperature, precipitation, and droughts as a basis for establishing the connection of environmental parameters and outbreaks of cholera. Thirteen cholera outbreaks between 2003 and 2023 in four African countries (Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, and Senegal) were assessed using odds ratio and k-means clustering analysis.

Results

Cholera outbreaks were 3.07 (95 % CI: [0.95, 9.88]) times more likely when drought conditions (negative precipitation anomalies, positive temperature anomalies, and negative Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index) were present, compared to their absence. When excess rainfall was also considered, the odds ratio increased to 3.50 (95 % CI: [1.03, 11.90]). Complementary evidence obtained using k-means clustering analysis supported the conclusion that outbreaks of cholera were common during drought conditions.

Conclusions

Considering the last few decades with increased severity and frequency of droughts in cholera-impacted regions, climate projections indicate the threat of cholera outbreaks will continue, especially noting increasing reports of cholera globally. Hence, predictive intelligence systems for rapid risk assessment, with respect to climate, drought, and human health, are warranted.",2025-04-22 12:01:16,3,PHealthy,science

mm310bo,1jueun6,reddit,"I feel like seeing Walk Score correlate to richer, white areas doesn’t mean Walk Score is flawed but rather that it shows how low-income areas aren’t invested in properly. Sometimes metrics can be biased towards its creators. I feel like this isn’t one of them. It’s no secret that low-income regions tend to have worse infrastructure, so of course they would score lower. That should be a sign to fix infrastructure in those areas, not change the metric so they artificially score higher (how does that help anyone? I doubt a poor person walking on the road is going to feel better that his neighbourhood has a higher score - if anything this might make it harder to argue for better infrastructure).

The one argument I could agree with was maybe not properly delineating types of shops. An area that’s “walkable” but requires a bus ride to get to a cheap grocery store isn’t really walkable *for living in* if affordable necessities aren’t available in walking distance. But considering how a lot of low income areas are food deserts, I’m not sure that that would change the outcome - but nonetheless it’s an important piece of information to look at.",2025-04-08 19:08:14,29,dovahkiitten16,science

What does this even mean?  What is the alternative to ""already"" having the amenities?  Not having them yet?  How does walk score have any impact on what neighborhoods will get new amenities in the future?  And what is ""skewing results towards"" a neighborhood?  Does that mean giving it a higher walk score or lower walk score?  A neighborhood with desirable amenities getting a high walk score is entirely appropriate.  It sounds like this is complaining about an accurate measurement because they don't like it being accurate, unless there's just a typo somewhere.

I guess that the authors are trying to deliver an anti-gentrifying message, but they come off as that meme of the opossum saying ""don't touch my garbage.""  Yes, the rich white people have the nice things because of money and racism, but that doesn't mean the nice things aren't nice.

Abstract:

>Walkability functions as an assumed good in many urbanist circles, and numerous metrics claim to quantify it. We examine one widely used metric, Walk Score, to consider how it extends racialized property formations. In particular, we consider how it relates to concentrations of whiteness, differential investment flows, and property valuations that are already inherently raced. The article illustrates how place (de)valorization co-occurs with racial segregation through a brief examination of Walk Score in Chicago. We situate our critique within literature that challenges the neutrality of walkability metrics and contextualize this neutrality within racial capitalism, arguing that this metric reflects and could contribute to inequitable investment flows and property (de)valuation. By examining these relationships, we argue that Walk Score takes part in reifying the geographies of racial capitalism and caution against algorithms that implicitly or explicitly value certain places above others.",2025-04-08 14:28:28,-26,Hrmbee,science

>Effective countermeasures against the adverse cardiovascular effects of circadian misalignment, such as effects experienced due to night work or jet lag, remain to be established in humans. Here, we aim to test whether eating only during daytime can mitigate such adverse effects vs. eating during the night and day (typical for night shift workers) under simulated night work (secondary analysis of NCT02291952). This single-blind, parallel-arm trial randomized 20 healthy participants (non-shift workers) to simulated night work with meals consumed during night and day (Nighttime Meal Control Group) or only during daytime (Daytime Meal Intervention Group). The primary outcomes were pNN50 (percentage consecutive heartbeat intervals >50 ms), RMSSD (root mean square of successive heartbeat differences), and LF/HF (low/high cardiac frequency). The secondary outcome was blood concentrations of prothrombotic factor plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). These measures were assessed under Constant Routine conditions, before (baseline) and after (postmisalignment) simulated night work. The meal timing intervention significantly modified the impact of simulated night work on cardiac vagal modulation and PAI-1 (pFDR = 0.001). In the Control Group, the postmisalignment Constant Routine showed a decrease in pNN50 by 25.7% (pFDR = 0.008) and RMMSD by 14.3% (pFDR = 0.02), and an increase in LF/HF by 5.5% (pFDR = 0.04) and PAI-1 by 23.9% (pFDR = 0.04), vs. the baseline Constant Routine. In the Intervention Group, there were no significant changes in these outcomes. For exploratory outcomes, the intervention significantly modified the impact of simulated night work on blood pressure (P < 0.05), with no significant change in the Control Group, and a significant reduction by 6-8% (P < 0.01) in the Intervention Group; without significant effects for heart rate or cortisol. These findings indicate that daytime eating, despite mistimed sleep, may mitigate changes in cardiovascular risk factors and offer translational evidence for developing a behavioral strategy to help minimize the adverse changes in cardiovascular risk factors in individuals exposed to circadian misalignment, such as shift workers.",2025-04-11 22:18:45,5,Hrmbee,science

Abstract

Sleep is closely linked to residential environmental factors such as light, noise, and temperature. Addressing sleep problems requires realistic contributions from both architectural and medical fields. Exposure to moderate light before waking positively impacts awakening quality. Individuals are beginning to use Internet of Things (IoT) devices, like motorized curtains, to introduce natural morning light into bedrooms while avoiding nighttime light. This study aims to explore the effectiveness of controlling natural light via window equipment to improve awakening quality. In a crossover randomized controlled trial, sleepiness, alertness, and fatigue were measured in 19 participants (nine females) after waking under three different natural light exposure conditions: IA, natural light exposure for 20 min before waking; IB, natural light exposure from dawn to waking; CC, no natural light exposure before waking. The effects of each condition on awakening quality were analyzed. The results showed no statistically significant differences in cumulative or maximum illuminance between IA and IB. Objective alertness and subjective sleepiness in the IA and IB were significantly better than in the CC. Objective sleepiness was significantly lower in IA compared with both IB and CC. These findings suggest that natural light control through window equipment can improve awakening quality; however, excessive or early exposure could increase mid-waking time, potentially harming awakening quality. This study presents an effective method (IA) for natural light control and offers interdisciplinary insights into architecture and sleep research in real-world settings.

Published in Science Advances, the study found that many species do not stick to a single daily rhythm, contradicting decades of scientific assumptions. These findings reveal the flexibility of wildlife and signal the need for a new framework to understand animal activity in a rapidly changing world.

What is diel activity? Mammals’ daily schedules — how wildlife activity is spread over a 24-hour cycle based on light availability — are grouped into four categories known as a diel phenotypes, said Humberto Perotto, Ph.D., associate professor and Joan Negley Kelleher Endowed Professor in Ranch Management in the Texas A&M Department of Rangeland, Wildlife and Fisheries Management.

Diurnal animals are most active during the day. 

Nocturnal animals are most active at night. 

Crepuscular species are typically active during the dawn and dusk. 

Cathemeral animals show irregular activity throughout the day and night.

The teenagers’ skeletons were unearthed at the cemetery of Basur Höyük where researchers previously uncovered evidence of “grand funerary rituals” and the burial of “spectacular” quantities of precious metals.

  
This grave site on the upper reaches of the Tigris and Euphrates has perplexed scientists as it challenges the conventional understanding of the formation of the first states by humans.

Tombs unearthed here are some of the richest, even though early settlements around the region were found to be otherwise small-scale and egalitarian

  
Now, a new study published in the journal Cambridge Archaeological Journal raises further questions about the nature of these tombs due to an abundance of teenagers buried here.

mm0axwq,1ju9mbu,reddit,"Body signals play a role in development even in infancy

Body signals such as heartbeat and breathing accompany us constantly, often unnoticed as background noise of our perception. Even in the earliest years of life, these signals are important as they contribute to the development of self-awareness and identity. However, until know little has been known about whether and how babies can perceive their own body signals. A recent study from Wiener Kinderstudien Lab at the University of Vienna demonstrates for the first time that babies as young as 3 months can perceive their own heartbeat. In addition, the team, headed by researchers from the University of Vienna, together with colleagues from the University of Potsdam and Royal Holloway University of London, also investigated for the first-time infants’ perception of their own breathing and found developments during the first two years of life. The results are now published in the prestigious journal eLife.

The perception of internal body signals is closely linked to emotional awareness, mental health, and self-perception. Early in life the ability to perceive one’s own body signals may be particularly important, as it often forms the basis for interactions with caregivers – for example babies rely on their caregivers to respond appropriately to signs of hunger or discomfort. Moreover, the development of self-awareness and identity partly depends on the perception and experience of one’s own body.

The study shows that even 3-month-old babies can perceive their own heartbeat and that this ability remains relatively stable during the first two years of life. At the same time, the findings indicate that the perception of breathing improves significantly during the second year. Interestingly, the ability to perceive the heartbeat and breathing does not appear to be related – much like in adults.

Research link: [Enhancing safety monitoring in post-stroke rehabilitation through wearable technologies](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/02692155241309083)

Abstract:

>**Objective**
>
>Current clinical practice guidelines support structured, progressive protocols for improving walking after stroke. Technology enables monitoring of exercise and therapy intensity, but safety concerns could also be addressed. This study explores functional mobility in post-stroke individuals using wearable technology to quantify movement smoothness—an indicator of safe mobility.
>
>**Design**
>
>Observational cohort study.
>
>**Setting**
>
>A movement analysis and rehabilitation laboratory.
>
>**Participants**
>
>A total of 56 chronic post-stroke individuals and 51 healthy controls.
>
>**Intervention**
>
>Participants performed the mobility test while wearing an inertial measurement unit attached to their waist. Thirty-two healthy participants also engaged in a steady-state walking task.
>
>**Main measures**
>
>Functional mobility smoothness by examining angular velocities in the yaw, pitch, and roll axes, employing the spectral arc length metrics.
>
>**Results**
>
>Our findings reveal that post-stroke individuals extend the duration of the timed-up-and-go test (≈9 s and 23 s longer compared to the controls) to ensure safe mobility—greater mobility smoothness (p < 0.001). Notably, for mild and severe impairments, post-stroke mobility demonstrated ≈8% and ≈11% greater smoothness in pitch movements, respectively (p = 0.025 and p = 0.002). In the roll direction, mobility was ≈12% smoother in cases of severe strokes (p = 0.006).
>
>**Conclusion**
>
>This study addresses a crucial gap in the understanding of mobility smoothness in chronic stroke survivors using wearable technology. Our study suggests the potential utility of spectral arc length to predict challenging mobility situations in real-world situations. We highlight the potential for automated monitoring of safety offering promising avenues for real-time, real-life monitoring.",2025-04-14 03:42:46,2,Hrmbee,science

mkuim4o,1josx1f,reddit,Totally makes sense. Slow wave (deep) sleep precedes bouts of REM. During slow wave the glymphatic system pumps cerebrospinal fluid through the brain to clear out waste aggregates in preparation for the synaptic reinforcement and pruning that occurs during REM. Disruption to both of those likely to increase both protein aggregates and mess with the amount of time the brain has to perform its synaptic function now more inefficiently due to uncleared waste.,2025-04-01 12:46:26,18,ishitar,science
mku5g80,1josx1f,reddit,"New research reveals that lower proportions of specific sleep stages are associated with reduced brain volume in regions vulnerable to the development of Alzheimer’s disease over time.

Results show that individuals with lower proportions of time spent in slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep had smaller volumes in critical brain regions, particularly the inferior parietal region, which is known to undergo early structural changes in Alzheimer’s disease. The results were adjusted for potential confounders including demographic characteristics, smoking history, alcohol use, hypertension, and coronary heart disease.

“Our findings provide preliminary evidence that reduced neuroactivity during sleep may contribute to brain atrophy, thereby potentially increasing the risk of Alzheimer’s disease,” said lead author Gawon Cho, who has a doctorate in public health and is a postdoctoral associate at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut. “These results are particularly significant because they help characterize how sleep deficiency, a prevalent disturbance among middle-aged and older adults, may relate to Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis and cognitive impairment.”

mnjn7zi,1k16kmx,reddit,"The findings, published in Brain, help to increase our understanding of how the human brain supports our ability to comprehend, draw conclusions, and deal with new and novel problems – otherwise known as reasoning skills.

To determine which brain areas are necessary for a certain ability, researchers study patients with brain lesions (an area of damage in the brain) caused by stroke or brain tumours. This approach, known as ‘lesion-deficit mapping’, is the most powerful method for localising function in the human brain.

Studying brain injuries can be difficult and time-consuming because researchers need a large number of patients with specific brain damage. This kind of damage can affect how a person thinks, feels, or moves. However, very few research centres have access to enough patients to conduct these studies effectively.

As a result, previous studies have mainly relied on functional imaging (fMRI) techniques in healthy individuals. However, these results can sometimes be misleading as they provide correlational rather than causal evidence.

mnkmhoj,1k16kmx,reddit,"# Abstract

Two of the most well-studied types of reasoning are analogical reasoning (AR) and deductive reasoning (DR). Yet, our understanding of the relationship between reasoning abilities and their neuroanatomical basis remains surprisingly limited. We aimed to conduct fine-grained anatomical mapping of performance on tests of AR, DR and fluid intelligence (Gf), in a large sample of patients with unilateral focal frontal or posterior lesions and healthy controls.

We assessed 247 prospectively recruited patients using two new tests: the Analogical Reasoning Test (ART) and the Deductive Reasoning Test (DRT); and the best-established measure of Gf: Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices (RAPM). Non-parametric Bayesian stochastic block modelling was used to reveal the community structure of lesion deficit networks, disentangling functional from confounding pathological distributed effects.

ART and DRT performance was significantly impaired in patients with frontal lesions \[ART: *F*(2,238) = 18.93; *P* < 0.001; Frontal group worse than Posterior group and healthy controls, both *P* < 0.001; DRT: *F*(2,387) = 18.491; *P* < 0.001; Frontal group worse than healthy controls, *P* < 0.01\]. Right frontal effects were evident on both tests. Thus, on the ART, right frontal patients were more impaired than left (*P* < 0.05). On the DRT, right frontal patients were more impaired than left frontal patients on questions with indeterminate solutions (*P* < 0.05) but not on questions with determinate ones. Non-parametric Bayesian stochastic block modelling implicated a right frontal network in ART and DRT performance. Strikingly, we found that this network was also implicated in performance on RAPM.

Our study represents the most robust investigation of AR and DR in the focally injured brain. Our findings imply that a right frontal network is critical. The ART and DRT appear to be promising new clinical tests, capable of evaluating reasoning abilities and identifying right frontal lobe dysfunction.",2025-04-17 12:18:26,5,dlrace,science
mnqj2yc,1k16kmx,reddit,"Makes sense that frontal group performed worse than posterior group, since posterior deficit would impact body movements/maneuvering tasks more than reasoning skills. 


As for right frontal deficit mapping to more adverse effects on both ART and (some specific aspects of) DRT, it should be noted that AR is a type of inductive reasoning which is a bottom-up probabilistic approach, and involves generating hypothesis/discovering patterns/exploring new ideas etc. to account for process oriented thinking and possible outcomes in terms of uncertainty. As such, even on the DRT, when it came to questions with indeterminate solutions, the same long shadows of AR related deficit reared its ugly head once again, as evident by the more impaired performance by the right frontal cohort, compared to their performance on questions with determinate solutions (that reflect top-down approach and definitive outcome oriented thinking).


All this to say that right frontal deficit acutely affects our stochastic modeling abilities and complex problem solving acumen. Whether brain-computer interfaces can successfully mitigate such deficit remains to be seen, so here's to the future. The more we know...",2025-04-18 10:30:21,2,EpiOntic,science

Abstract

Communication barriers pose significant challenges for the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) community, limiting their access to essential services, social interactions, and professional opportunities. To bridge this gap, assistive technologies leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning have gained prominence. This study presents a real-time American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation system that integrates deep learning with keypoint tracking to enhance accessibility and foster inclusivity. By combining the YOLOv11 model for gesture recognition with MediaPipe for precise hand tracking, the system achieves high accuracy in identifying ASL alphabet letters in real time. The proposed approach addresses challenges such as gesture ambiguity, environmental variations, and computational efficiency. Additionally, this system enables users to spell out names and locations, further improving its practical applications. Experimental results demonstrate that the model attains a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 98.2%, with an inference speed optimized for real-world deployment. This research underscores the critical role of AI-driven assistive technologies in empowering the DHH community by enabling seamless communication and interaction.

mokkave,1k5t3t5,reddit,"**Fe(OTf)3 or Photosensitizer-free blue light activated diazo-thioglycoside donors for Iterative and stereoselective glycosylations**

Abstract

Conventional methods for thioglycoside activation often rely on precious and toxic platinum group metals. Here, we report a catalytic glycosylation strategy employing diazo-thioglycoside donors activated by earth-abundant iron or photosensitizer-free blue light conditions. It confers orthogonal reactivity relative to most glycosyl donors, including widely used thioglycosides and alkyne-based donors, thereby enabling one-pot orthogonal synthesis of glycans. The Thorpe-Ingold-like effect drives the proximity of iron- or blue-light-generated carbenes to the sulfur atom of thioglycosides. This approach accommodates diverse protecting groups and nucleophiles. It applies to various glycosyl donors derived from glucose, mannose, galactose, rhamnose, xylose, lactose, 2-deoxyamino glucose, and furanose derivatives such as ribose and arabinose. Moreover, we demonstrate the robustness of this methodology through challenging 1,2-cis furanosides, late-stage modifications of biomolecules like cholesterol, and the drug simvastatin on a gram scale, along with the iterative synthesis of challenging hexasaccharides.

Pregnancy may offer some protection from developing Long COVID, found a new study led by Weill Cornell Medicine, University of Rochester Medical Center, University of Utah Health and Louisiana Public Health Institute. Previous research has mostly focused on non-pregnant adults affected by Long COVID—a condition lasting for months after a person recovers from a SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The study, published April 1 in Nature Communications, helps fill a critical gap about Long COVID in women infected with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy. “This population is so important and vulnerable, but we had no evidence about their Long COVID risk to guide their care,” said Dr. Chengxi Zang, an instructor in population health sciences at Weill Cornell Medicine, who co-led the research. “We hope this new data will help clinicians develop better Long COVID prevention and treatment strategies for pregnant women and help those most at risk.”

With comparable gonadotropin use, multiple reproductive outcomes changed during all seasons and correlated with PM2.5 exposure. These included both early stages in the ART process like the number of oocytes and how many entered metaphase II (MII), the number of embryos suitable for transfer, and the number of good-quality embryos.

  
After adjusting for age and expected changes in seasonal rates, a significant negative association was observed between PM2.5 exposure and both pregnancy and life birth rates. PM2.5 exposure did not significantly affect miscarriage rates.

As compared to winter months, the spring and summer seasons were associated with a greater number of pregnancy rates for each transfer, with this difference statistically significant between winter and spring months. Live birth rates were also higher during the spring, summer, and autumn months.

mn932fm,1jzvdys,reddit,"Abstract:

Drones have become invaluable tools for studying animal behaviour in the wild, enabling researchers to collect aerial video data of group-living animals. However, manually piloting drones to track animal groups consistently is challenging due to complex factors such as terrain, vegetation, group spread and movement patterns. The variability in manual piloting can result in unusable data for downstream behavioural analysis, making it difficult to collect standardized datasets for studying collective animal behaviour.

1. To address these challenges, we present WildWing, a complete hardware and software open-source unmanned aerial system (UAS) for autonomously collecting behavioural video data of group-living animals. The system's main goal is to automate and standardize the collection of high-quality aerial footage suitable for computer vision-based behaviour analysis. We provide a novel navigation policy to autonomously track animal groups while maintaining optimal camera angles and distances for behavioural analysis, reducing the inconsistencies inherent in manual piloting.
2. The complete WildWing system costs only $650 and incorporates drone hardware with custom software that integrates ecological knowledge into autonomous navigation decisions. The system produces 4 K resolution video at 30 fps while automatically maintaining appropriate distances and angles for behaviour analysis. We validate the system through field deployments tracking groups of Grevy's zebras, giraffes and Przewalski's horses at The Wilds conservation centre, demonstrating its ability to collect usable behavioural data consistently.
3. By automating the data collection process, WildWing helps ensure consistent, high-quality video data suitable for computer vision analysis of animal behaviour. This standardization is crucial for developing robust automated behaviour recognition systems to help researchers study and monitor wildlife populations at scale. The open-source nature of WildWing makes autonomous behavioural data collection more accessible to researchers, enabling wider application of drone-based behavioural monitoring in conservation and ecological research.",2025-04-15 15:54:24,7,Impossible_Cookie596,science

Summary:

>- Lightning strikes kill hundreds of millions of trees annually, but their role in shaping tree life history and diversity is largely unknown.
>- Here, we use data from a unique lightning location system to show that some individual trees counterintuitively benefit from being struck by lightning.
>- Lightning killed 56% of 93 directly struck trees and caused an average of 41% crown dieback among the survivors. However, among these struck trees, 10 direct strikes caused negligible damage to Dipteryx oleifera trees while killing 78% of their lianas and 2.1 Mg of competitor tree biomass. Nine trees of other long-lived taxa survived lightning with similar benefits. On average, a D. oleifera tree > 60 cm in diameter is struck by lightning at least five times during its lifetime, conferring these benefits repeatedly. We estimate that the ability to survive lightning increases lifetime fecundity 14-fold, largely because of reduced competition from lianas and neighboring trees. Moreover, the unusual heights and wide crowns of D. oleifera increase the probability of a direct strike by 49–68% relative to trees of the same diameter with average allometries.
>- These patterns suggest that lightning plays an underappreciated role in tree competition, life history strategies, and species coexistence.",2025-04-11 17:51:15,7,Hrmbee,science

mko73n1,1jo1hym,reddit,"From the article: A longitudinal study of adolescents in Sweden found that individuals prone to antisocial behavior at age 15 were more likely to use drugs or alcohol by age 17. In contrast, those who exhibited more prosocial behaviors were less likely to develop these habits. The findings were [published](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306460325000632?via%3Dihub) in Addictive Behaviors Addictive Behaviors.

Antisocial behaviors are actions that violate societal norms and can negatively impact others or society as a whole. These behaviors range from relatively minor acts, such as lying and cheating, to more serious offenses like theft, violence, and other criminal activities. Antisocial behaviors are generally viewed as disruptive and harmful, often resulting in social and legal consequences for the individual.

Prosocial behaviors, on the other hand, include actions intended to benefit others—such as helping, sharing, donating, volunteering, and cooperating. These behaviors are typically motivated by empathy, concern for others, and a desire to contribute positively to society. Because of their role in promoting social cohesion and harmony, prosocial behaviors are widely encouraged.

Study author Simon Jangard and his colleagues aimed to investigate the relationship between substance use—specifically alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs—and both antisocial and prosocial behaviors. They focused on two types of antisocial behavior: conduct problems and criminal behavior. For prosocial behavior, they examined three categories: global prosociality, general trust, and institutional trust.",2025-03-31 12:02:56,2,chrisdh79,science

ml6y3hn,1jqg18x,reddit,"From the article: Asthma affects more than 6% of U.S. children, making it the most common chronic disease in kids nationwide. It’s difficult to isolate any single cause, but one of the most common contributors is air pollution: Studies have shown that breathing air with high levels of fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide and other environmental pollutants can increase children’s risk of developing asthma. But it’s been unclear whether long-term, early childhood exposure to ozone, the pollutant that most frequently exceeds U.S. air quality standards, contributes to the disease.  

Logan Dearborn, a doctoral student at the University of Washington, set out to find a possible link. In a study [published](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2832109) April 2 in JAMA Network Open, Dearborn and collaborators identified a puzzling trend: Children exposed to higher levels of ozone in their first two years of life were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with asthma or wheezing at ages 4-6 — but researchers didn’t observe the increased risk of asthma at ages 8-9.  

While the researchers couldn’t pin down the exact reason, possible explanations include the changing nature of asthma as kids age, which could lead to a drop-off in formal diagnoses, and the influence of other risk factors and pollutants on asthma as children’s lungs grow. 

“It’s a puzzling finding,” said Dearborn, who led the research in the UW Department of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences. “It’s something we spent a long time trying to consider, and I don’t know if we ever came up with a satisfying answer. But these findings are important. Even if we only see the effects early in life, there are still all kinds of associated health care costs and stresses for families. There are all sorts of larger contextual factors about having this chronic disease at any point in life.”",2025-04-03 12:55:03,1,chrisdh79,science
