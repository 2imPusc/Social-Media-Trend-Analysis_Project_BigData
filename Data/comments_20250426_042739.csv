The Live At Budokan performance? Absolute goddamn power-pop perfection. Huge sound, absolute shredder of a guitar hook, the crowd sounds as they blow the absolute roof off of the joint.

mlv8lv6,1jtlvt5,reddit,"Rick is a master businessman. He knows when to work with an artist and when not to. Take RHCP. They asked Rick to produce their third album, but he turned them down. He would later say he got bad vibes form the band because they were all on drugs. Three years later, they have a new guitarist and drummer and having made a fourth album that is getting them some national recognition, Rick agrees to produce their fifth album. This album brings them to international acclaim. So he knew to wait until the band itself was good enough to have success rather than anything he did to make them successful. You also see this in the documentary on the making of the album. Rick barely does anything except let the band bounce a few ideas off of him, the album is practically self produced with all sonic shaping done by Brendan O'Brien, the engineer. Brendan would later go on to produce a slew of hit records in the 90s using engineering technics he first used on the RHCP album. 

Fast forward to Johnny Cash and Rick is working with him just in time for the 30 year rule (nostalgia for 30 years prior) to take hold, and does the same thing, essentially lets Johnny self produce. But the difference is Cash had nearly 15 years worth of material built up, they just curated the best of it, and threw in covers on the albums to guarantee relevance and airplay.

mlvftah,1jtlvt5,reddit,"That’s a pretty cynical take on Rick Rubin. Personally, I think having someone who can walk into the room and offer a direction that the band or artist hadn’t considered is invaluable. You can’t put a price on that.

Look at what he did with Johnny Cash. Rubin saw a way to reinvent him when no one else did. That’s not something to be cynical about. He helped create the blueprint for first-wave hip hop, and at the same time he also produced what many consider the first real speed metal record with Slayer. His range, taste, and sensibility are undeniable.

What makes Rubin special isn’t just his resume. It’s the way he works with artists. Like Brian Eno, he’s not an accomplished player, but he brings a perspective, a sensibility, and a process that reshapes how a band thinks and works. He’s like a brilliant coach, someone who can see the bigger picture, identify a new path, and help the group realize it.

At a certain level in music, everyone’s talented. The players are great, the skills are there. But sometimes what makes the real difference is that outside brain—a producer who can offer a fresh idea or reframe the entire approach.

Many producers age and turn into mentors, and while it's easier today to see the marketing side of it in his case, I guarantee you this has been the 'early retirement' strategy of tons of producers, and is no less insincere for simply asking to be paid for services.

I don't think there's any lost credibility over this. 

It's very common among creative people to be bad with money, unorganized, to go with their gut, seeming flighty or flakey, capricious etc. It comes with the territory. I've mastered albums for free, accepted a case of whisky, house cleaning, cookies and christmas dinner, all because of these reasons.

mlvfukw,1jtlvt5,reddit,"That’s a pretty cynical take on Rick Rubin. Personally, I think having someone who can walk into the room and offer a direction that the band or artist hadn’t considered is invaluable. You can’t put a price on that.

Look at what he did with Johnny Cash. Rubin saw a way to reinvent him when no one else did. That’s not something to be cynical about. He helped create the blueprint for first-wave hip hop, and at the same time he also produced what many consider the first real speed metal record with Slayer. His range, taste, and sensibility are undeniable.

What makes Rubin special isn’t just his resume. It’s the way he works with artists. Like Brian Eno, he’s not an accomplished player, but he brings a perspective, a sensibility, and a process that reshapes how a band thinks and works. He’s like a brilliant coach, someone who can see the bigger picture, identify a new path, and help the group realize it.

At a certain level in music, everyone’s talented. The players are great, the skills are there. But sometimes what makes the real difference is that outside brain—a producer who can offer a fresh idea or reframe the entire approach. Even if their contribution isn’t always hands-on musically, the impact they have on the overall shape of a project can be massive. That’s where Rubin shines.",2025-04-07 15:00:29,0,zendeath,music

If you watch the Funky Monks documentary, you see him tell Flea to simplify his bass playing. This is a huge part of the albums sound. Instead of excessive slap bass playing, Flea is melodic and takes a less is more approach. Listen to the bassline in Under the Bridge during the chorus. It is fucking incredible. Those are the kinds of contributions he makes, and he's clearly got a gut instinct for this stuff.

Also produced The War of Art by American Head Charge, which is one of my favorite ever albums, so that's another point in his favor lol.",2025-04-07 18:49:35,0,Weeping_Sanity_515,music

He still charges enormous fees for production work, which, by many his own account is extremely hands-off.

he's very open about his approach, if you want a temporary extra member of the band to guide you through the creative process, Rick is not the guy, but if you're shitting out material and you want someone to guide you finding the right direction, depth and performances, then Rick is your guy

>Is Rick Rubin a wise man who made money by accident?

no, he's not especially wise, but he has a good ear and he did kinda make his money by accident

>  
Or is he a master of branding whose detachment is part of a very strategic performance?

no, Rick's brand is a long track record of big albums, if he was a *""master of branding""*, he'd be involved with all kinds of endorsements, putting billboards of himself up and putting out albums full of other people's performances but with a Rick Rubin Presents header

i think a lot of the OP is reaching, there is no proof of the ""exorbitant"" fees Rick charges, but i do agree with the criticism of rich people charging monthly fees and having sponsors

could Rick help smaller people out, sure, but there's plenty of other people who actually know music and can play for that, Rick is for people with heavy output who've hit a wall or plateau or need help sifting and steering

Rick has an ear, that ear costs money and no one is forced to use it, Rick was one time asked by an interviewer how he sells himself despite having no musical background, training or skill and he replied *""i'm not trying to sell it""*

And Steve Albini is actually a perfect example of shooting yourself in the foot. The guy who produced ""In Utero"" was often struggling to get by and keep his business running because of his belief that he should not be paid royalties. 

And also, not everyone would agree with the idea that Johnny Cash covering ""Hurt"" was a brilliant move. A few years ago I came across some pretty scathing criticism from Jakob Dylan and Bob Dylan, who seem to feel making Cash cover contemporary music like that was demeaning to his legacy. Jakob talked about it on Marc Maron's podcast. They seem to believe it was a ""card trick"", or marketing like you've suggested. Not saying I agree with that take but I hadn't really heard any criticism of the albums before. 

Apparently Jakob did not enjoy working with Ruben on his solo albums, saying ""I don't need a guru.""",2025-04-07 19:16:47,0,braincandybangbang,music

Disclaimer: one of the verses has the N word in it, and since I’m just gonna copy and paste the lyrics, it’s gonna be there

“Just a lil’ nigga from the six with a motherfuckin’ chip on my shoulder

Check a nigga chain, go and get this shit over

Chevy or the Benz, he’ll probably’ll get the Rover

But, then again, all three what he get for a show

But he never sober, probably gon’ need a chauffeur

‘Cause he ain’t underground no more, niggas was gophers

Low and behold, them hoes say now they know you

North-pole, South-pole, bitches bipolar

Pour a four, Ye told me drive slowly

Twenty-four plus more, my drive Kobe

Give and go, the flow is my only

One of a kind, you not Obi-Wan Kenobi

Many have tried and failed, parking lot full of shells

When hammers are flyin’, wear a disguise, you not Loki

No Avenger friends, we not homies

Wanna live too fast? You die slowly

Really, you jokin’, I don’t know what these niggas smokin’

That shit potent if you thinkin’ I ain’t the dopest

The whip ghostin’, the fit, Gosha, the hip Olsen

Twin clips, lil’ nigga, you could get both of ‘em

Rap game takeover, I’m JID Hova

Gettin’ dirt off of my shoulder, I’m gettin’ older

Way out in Budapest, from the Crest Boulder

I’ll be there if you lookin’ over your left shoulder

They be there if I need a nigga to step on you

Gs movin’ in silence, niggas’ deaf toned

Tone deaf, my songs is bein’ slept on

Fast forward, I’m on, bumpin’ in headphones

Shawty wanna take off her thong, jump in the bed

I don’t know her but I’m thinkin’, “Oh well, give me 
your cell phone”

Cellulite on her ass, titties was silicone

In the land of Atlanta, I love bein’ home

I want a seat on the throne, I ain’t gon’ leave it alone

‘Fore all the people is speakin’ out, let’s even the score

Knock on the door, it’s a shotgun, you peepin’ a hole

Niggas asleep on the flow, I used to sleep on the floor

I’m undefeated, you want a feature, I’m eatin’ your soul

My sister a killer, she be shootin’ out a Kia Soul

Wanna get the kid, that probably cost a couple kilos

Me and Mike rob you for your dimes like Deebo”

mlwk8jp,1jts3wy,reddit,"Stop listening to it then!

Put it on a shelf and look for new things to make you feel like that again. 

It’s a weird feeling for sure - to have an album that you swear you could listen to forever and always love it, and one day…you don’t. 

I’ve “shelved” Dark Side, Random Access Memories, Alive 2007, Abbey Road, Magical Mystery Tour, Sgt. Pepper (actually probably all of The Beatles now that I think of it), My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, and Hyperdrama (just to name a few quick-to-mind albums). I thought they were all great and can recall them note-for-note when they’re on, but I don’t get that same feeling I used to like when I was younger. Sometimes the itch itches and I’ll throw one on and enjoy every moment, but the time has got to be right for me to get that same “feeling”. 

You can’t listen to it again for the first time, which is a crying shame. Let it fade away a bit in to your memories, and drag it back out when you forget it a bit more. 

The good news: you get to go find new songs, albums, and artists in a search for that “new thing”.

Maybe see a doctor for some blood tests or start taking a daily multivitamin(if applicable) to test it. Supplementation has helped me tons.

More recently someone shared a story on his discogs page that somebody had met his cousin in an art class and confirmed that he is still alive but basically doesn’t want to be found.

It’s the one album that unlocked music for me. It’s absolutely stunning — nominally goth rock, but kinda transcends genres. Super intricate song writing, interlocking guitars and play off each other, and melodies that jump between the instruments, starting on guitar, jumping to bass and vocals, then pack to guitar. People often say it’s as if Tool or Pink Floyd made goth, and was also produced by Pink Floyds main engineer. It is still on regular rotation.

It was taking Cage's idea of found sound as music to the next level.  Monk changed how I viewed role of traditional theory in modern music. How it could be bent, ignored, or followed as a tool more than a requirement.  An extension in some ways of Cage's use of chance in composition.

The autumn of the year my grandfather died was really warm, beautiful, golden, and sunny.  Every day while I was processing the loss I would listen to this song, then go for a walk at the riverside at my local park under the golden birch and maple trees.  That path led to a church, and I would wander around the churchyard or sit on one of the benches until I felt settled enough inside that I could go home.  Every time I listen to this song I think of autumn leaves and bright sunlight, now.  I had the privilege to hear them play it live last week - so now that's part of the emotional resonance of this song, as well.

* It reminds me of my mom's bar. A small thing she owned for a while when I turned 21. I had some great fucking times there, many of which I forget. Every time I hear that song I want to raise a glass to someone and cheers to that place. We got plenty high there, and locked up, stumbled out, and crashed at my mom's place a 1/2 mile away after drinking our share once or twice. 
* It brings back a lot of bittersweet memories. Memories of her husband at the time, who seemed alright until he showed his true colors. Pool games, drinking games, good food, and long nights. It brings all of those back. 

Down to the River by Brown Bird

* It's how I feel about my woman. I looked many places for answers. I was a Pagan, a Christian, and my own thing before deciding that I only need her to tell me if I'm alright or not.
* ""Only one soul in this whole world would have me just the goddamn way that I am."" I resonate with that.

I dreamed I Died by Devildriver

* Basically its a story of how he died, saw the gates of heaven, went through the list of shit he did and St. Peter was like ""You lived alright--lived a little dark but that's alright. Because between the dark side and the right side is to have no fear.""
* If I understand correctly, he's called into battle on the side of heaven and told to be a soldier for heaven, and shakes off the dream that he died and comes back.

Hallucinogenics by Matt Maeson.

* I've done a few. I can't relate to the whole story of the song, but I love story-songs. When I'm in a bad mood, listening to that while taking a hit usually sets me straight.
* It's a sad song, but the ""rippin with my sinners cuz fuck it man I ain't no beginner"" bit gets me for some reason. The way he says it is hopeful in some way.

Nightwitches by Sabaton

* I didn't learn about this song until after I listened to a podcast on ""Cool People who Did Cool Stuff."" Basically they were bombers for Russia, all-women, and they were kick-ass.
* I learned about the song about a month after I heard the podcast and thought ""HOLY SHIT, is the about the 588?"" Then he said in the song ""588"" and chills went through me.
* These women would turn their fucking planes OFF before arriving at a bomb site to avoid being heard, then after dropping the bombs, one would climb OUT of the cockpit to manually restart their cloth-winged, bullshit-ass aircraft's engine in order to return home. Thank god they left their ovaries at home, otherwise it'd weigh their planes down.

Shadows Fire by Ugly Valley Boys

* I've had sleep issues for forever, so some of that song resonates, regarding long nights.
* ""Now I'm somewhere between in and out of the lost and found. Couldn't tell ya if I'm moving up or going down."" I've felt that feeling.",2025-03-27 04:30:42,1,Jolly_Contest_2738,music

Peals of fragile thunder

keeping time

Recall the days that still are to come

some sing blue.

Hang your heart on laughing willow

stray down to the water,

deep sea of love

beneath the sweet calm face of the sea

swift undertow.

Life may be sweeter for this, I don’t know,

See how it feels in the end.

May Lady Lullaby sing plainly for you

soft, strong, sweet and true.

Cloud hands reaching from a rainbow

tapping at the window,

touch your hair

So swift and bright

strange figures of light

float in air.

Who can stop what must arrive now?

Something new is waiting to be born

Dark as the night you’re still by my side

shine inside.

Gone are the days we stopped to decide

where we should go, we just ride.

Gone are the broken eyes we saw through in dreams

gone, both dream and lie.

Life may be sweeter for this, I don’t know,

Feels like it might be all right,

While Lady Lullaby sings plainly through you

Love still rings true.

midnight on a carrousel ride,

reaching for the gold ring

down inside.

Never could reach it,

just slips away

but I try.”

And you run, and you run
To catch up with the sun, but it’s sinking
And racing around
To come up behind you again

But you’re older
Shorter of breath
And one day closer to death

Every year is getting shorter
Never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught
Or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation
Is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over
Thought I’d something more to say

To make it big, you needed to get the right amount of support from your label, media buyers at chains like Walmart and other gatekeepers. 

Which means if you didn't fit a premade format/genre; you either changed to fit or you missed out. This is related to why ""selling out"" was a much more relevant concept; because it was the only viable way for uncategorized bands to make it.

mn1yakf,1jyrmh3,reddit,"The Tubes were too avant-garde for the mainstream.  Late 70s art-rock, borrowed from the glam rock movement, took it to a theatrical approach in-concert, and they were a blast to see live. I do think they tried to set that aside a bit and get into the mainstream, and this was around the same time as Devo was getting a bit more attention. She's a Beauty (1983) was a MTV hit, but their first attempt at a breakthrough was the unfortunate choice to be in Xanadu, along with Gene Kelly, the guy from The Warriors, roller-skating and Olivia Newton-John.

The Tubes aren't for everyone, and while I do think they were best seen live, I sort of put them in a slot with Devo, J. Geils Band, and Utopia (bands I've seen live), where I can enjoy their work, even if it's a bit dated, but I do think the live concert is what drove both my enjoyment and their reputation.

Talk to Ya Later and She's a beauty were done by David Foster, guitarist Steve Lukather, and Fee Wyabill. They were done behind the bands back. Foster tried to then make a deal with them to let him do 4 songs and then the band could do anything they wanted for the rest of the album. The band rejected the offer and they never had a commercial hit again.

So they kind of got caught between having to choose between making all their own music, or being a commercial success. Fee preferred the commercial success, but the rest of the band preferred making their own music. Kind of understandable as Fee got to participate in the commercial successes, but the rest of the band did not.

I decided at that point i'd probaly never be able to afford a gig, fast foraward to being 18 and I find out that plenty of places had gigs that cost £10 or less and that they were a lot better than a shitty pop band.

Edit: I should add the reason I thought that because if a shit band was £50 how much would a good or great band be like Deep Purple, Slade or Sweet? (bands I was a big fan of in the late 90s.) 

I have paid more than that for larger bands but rarely is it over £30, usually I go to festivals for larger bands but i'm seeing Iron Maiden in June. The ticket, IIRC, was £120 for general standing, I can't exactly recall and the hotel has pushed it close to £200.

*From Perry Farrell assuming Green Day was a boy band to Courtney Love throwing punches, we look at the wildest moments of the decade-defining traveling festival.*

Before Lollapalooza became just another giant festival, it was a culture-shaking Nineties traveling carnival that helped define the thing we used to call “alternative.” Key moments in the careers of Pearl Jam, Nine Inch Nails, Ice-T, Green Day, Rage Against the Machine, Courtney Love, and many more played out on its stages, as chronicled in the excellent new oral-history book Lollapalooza: The Uncensored Story of Alternative Rock’s Wildest Festival.

In the new episode of Rolling Stone Music Now, authors Tom Beaujour and Richard Bienstock break down some of the wildest Lolla stories from their book.

mnojimg,1k1r4sf,reddit,"I listened to indie radio stations, notably radio stations associated with universities. They would have those very niche programs with underground music. 

Normally they would talk a lot about their discoveries, where to buy them etc... I would then go downtown to very niche stores that sold imports.

Often, if you get a very knowledgable person at the counter they would then show you some other music you might like in that genre. 

My other way to discover music is that I had in my area a lot of stores specialized in trading used CD's. Again, the people behind the counter were amazing and they led me to some very fine discoveries through exchanges. 

Honestly they were pretty eager to help. Most of them were young and into alternative, industrial and metal music. They need people swapping cd's for their business so they would make sure you had to come back to hear the next new gem. 

Bonus point, they would also let me know about small bands playing in pubs and recommending I check them out.

In those days you were limited to the albums and CDs in your collection, and potentially your cassette collection, which could be store bought or homemade. But you didn't consider that as good as an album or CD, it was a way to hear music you didn't own. 

You could also tape stuff off the radio. My early education as a drummer came from the Philadelphia jazz station at Temple University, a couple 90 minutes tapes recorded on a rainy Saturday that I still have. I would tape the live concerts on Sunday nights, even groups I didn't know, so I could trade them for others. 

You'd get stuff used for cheap, on a whim. If you knew some good magazines,you could mail-order as cheap as going to the store.

mnol86b,1k1r4sf,reddit,"Compilations! and to a lesser extent music festivals, for some it is likely to be the other way round, for me I wish it had been. 

By the time I was buying music I knew what I liked I just had trouble finding it, I tolerated some current bands and liked others but there was nothing current that I loved. I knew what I wanted and I knew it had to exist but it wasn't there.  
 Part of this is because of the era I grew up in and marketing. My Dad was a DJ in the 1970s so I knew I loved glam rock, it was the 90s and i knew I didn't love grunge, current punk, metal (we'll get back to this) indie, ska or britpop and I hated boybands, girlbands, hiphop and R and B. Metal in the 90s was primarily hip hop orientated with bands like Limp Biskit, Linkin Park, Slipknot and Korn all being very rap focused and all being marketed as metal or nu-metal. I was watching TOTP2 rather than TOTP. 

I was wallowing in a lot of 1970s rock when I started buying CDs in 2002, i did buy some albums by bands I tolerated such as Feeder, Nirvana, Guns and Roses, The Foo Fighters and Muse but they turned out to have worse tracks than the ones that were released and so instead of liking these bands more I ended up disliking them. I was buying albums by Deep Purple, Queen, Black Sabbath and Motorhead and loving them though. 

I was fed up by 2003, I was ready to forget modern music completely, I was buying some compilations but mostly single band compilations. I did try [The Best Air Guitar Album In The World... Ever!](https://www.discogs.com/master/317155-Various-The-Best-Air-Guitar-Album-In-The-World-Ever) which had a few interesting tracs on it and then later it's [sequel](https://www.discogs.com/master/597336-Various-The-Best-Air-Guitar-Album-In-The-World-II). The sequel had Run to the Hills by Iron Maiden on and it was what i had been looking for. I had heard of Iron Maiden but because they were a metal band i ignored them because my impression of metal, as stated, was just rapping with guitars. I was angry and happy, the conflict was strong but within 2 or 3 months I had 6 studio albums and a best of by them. I ended up listening to a lot of classic metal bands and classic hard rock bands still. i was buying compilations still and exploring work by the bands I loved. 

In 2007 I finally learnt to love modern metal bands as I discovered, the long way round, that they weren't all rappers. I missed out on a lot due to this as I was so fed up and angry with modern music by that point. One thing I regret is not going to Bloodstock in Derby. I lived in Derby but between 2004 and 2007 I wasn't interested, I didn't know thr bands, I was convinced they were all current, I had no easy way to find out (i didn't have the internet at home at that point) I was ignorant of it.   
  
However in 2007 I went to the Download Festival and Bloodstock Open Air, this was the big turning point. 

Bands I was OK with like Marilyn Manson, Evanescence and a couple of others were not great live. I didn't have a schedule so I definitely missed bands (me and my girlfriends strategy was to wander around and see what was going on, don't do this, you will miss out on bands and regret it for years).  
One band I missed was After Forever, a band that I love these days, I discovered them via Epica which has Mark Jansen from After Forever in and Nightwish as the lead singer of After Forever was Floor Jansen. I also missed Dream Theater, I didn't have any interest in them until a few years later - prejudice again - and that would've been cool as I've still not seen them live.

Anyway I did see Motley Crue, Napalm Death, Slayer and Turisas and loved them but this led to a sense of unease about seeing Iron Maiden, what if they weren't as good as I thought? Luckily they were better, a lot better, they were utterly superb and reinforced their position as my favourite band. 

I went to Bloodstock though, and while the weather was worse the bands were better overall, much more consistent, much more entertaining and I also saw Epica and Lacuna Coil, both bands that I still love. Also I have just remembered I went to Download for the day in 2005 and saw Nightwish live, a bloody great band, SOAD were not great live though they were a lot better when I saw them a few years later. 

Anyway compilations can lead you to great things, I still buy compilations, most recently one called Progression: A Progressive rock anthology, where i discovered a couple of bands and finally listened to some bands I was aware of like Curved Air. I was not interested in prog for a long time, as I was under the impression it was just rambling noise, I even had prog songs I loved I just didn't know they were prog. These days I have a lot from bands like Hawkwind to an extensive Dream Theater collection.

  
Anyway genre and subgenre is important, know what you are listening to, don't listen to other people's opinions on genre and try to see a band live before you get an album, it's not always possible, though high quality recordings are available on youtube for a lot of bands though some, especially with some bands are post-processed in the audio so it's not exactly the same but it's what they call in television ""as live"". 

  
So yes, compilations, even new a lot can be had very cheaply, I paid, no joke, [£3 for a 3CD](https://www.discogs.com/release/6691392-Various-Greatest-Ever-Heavy-Metal-The-Definitive-Collection) set in a local supermarket once and I still listen to it, I also discovered quite a few bands from it. Festivals too but you should have a vague idea of what you like before going, you don't want to end up watching Beyonce when you love bands like Sweet.",2025-04-18 00:41:16,3,Martipar,music

Here in the UK in the 70s/80s we were limited to Top Of The Pops on BBC1 every Thursday night and BBC Radio 1 & commercial radio pumping out chart music. If you were of a more alternative taste you'd be limited to John Peel's show at 10pm - midnight every weeknight on Radio One. Late night ITV at least showed The Chart Show which played videos from different charts (indie, dance, metal etc), for a brief glorious few months they broadcast The New Music from Canada (a compilation of Much Music stuff) which opened me up to a lot of new bands (but I had to videotape the episodes as they were usually broadcast at 3am). With more TV channels and a broadening of Radio 1's playlist the chance to see/hear new music definitely improved from the mid 80s onwards.



For me, if a disk didn't ""stick"" after repeated listens then that was it. The tracks I liked were recorded to cassette for compilations I'd listen to in the car. A local record shop and a guy at the local market would buy back used CDs, so quite often I'd tape the songs I liked and sell the disks off to them cheap.



Most of my listening was done at night or in the car (no CD player, so disks were copied to tape, If you were lucky you could get a CD on one side of a C90, giving you 2 albums per tape - C120s were notorious for jamming in tape players and C60s were just totally the wrong length for albums).",2025-04-18 09:25:47,1,bez_lightyear,music

mnqyirl,1k1r4sf,reddit,"Everywhere else.

Turn on the radio and listen to it. Some stations or radio shows even played up and coming artists. John Peel’s radio sessions were famous because a lot of bands would perform their music live to avoid licensing rights or fees and he used his show to promote a lot more music that normally didn’t receive airplay of all genres. In addition, amateur college stations and pirate radio stations (those that would broadcast on a signal in international waters to avoid rights/licensing issues) was also a thing in many places.

Word of mouth. Either people you know would hear or listen to something and recommend it, lend you their copy if they owned any albums or singles, in the 70’s when cassettes started to come up you could even tape peoples record collection and this was a common way to share music, maybe even the grandfather to p2p file sharing. Some records even warned against making copies as piracy.

Live music. Going to a local club and a band would play. I think a lot of early bands got their start this way. Beatles for example in Hamburg, and I’m sure this was a big thing among circles like Jazz and Blues where musicians would meet up and play together since it was more about knowing the tempo of the leader and being on key, but those genres really lean into improvisation and adding your own flare as an instrumentalist. Naturally, the good players would eventually get into each others circles. Another thing was a lot of musicians moving to where there was a scene. If you played country and gospel music, moving to Memphis where you could get recognized by a Sun Records employee, or play the Grand all Opry would be important. Come into the 60’s and there was a huge garage/psyche scene coming out of San Francisco and coastal California that a lot of bands moved out there. I believe this is part of the story with people like Captain Beefheart and Frank Zappa when they started because there were a lot of people out there who were doing similar things. I’d say the more regional scenes started cropping up later into punk and metal music (Bay Area thrash, DC hardcore, even up to the late 80’s with the Seattle grunge) but also would inspire people to be a part of it and move out where things were happening and similar minded people existed.

Record stores were also a haven of curated folks who knew their albums. The staff might listen to a lot more music and be able to recommend bands and albums to someone who likes something in particular. Heard the Beatles come to America? Check out these other bands coming out of England such as The Rolling Stones, The Kinks, The Who or into the 70’s turn of the decade check out Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Yardbirds.  I’m sure stores playing a record to try and boost sales is a tale as old as time as well, so you could move these new releases. There’s a scene in high fidelity where the owner of the record store says “I’m about to sell 3 copies of the beta band” puts the cd on behind the counter and people in the store ask about it. 

If all else fails, album covers. People used to look at stuff like that and try to figure out if it was their thing. This was especially popular with rock bands into the 70’s where a cool album cover or certain style was a good sign. It’s a bigger risk, and many people would force themselves to listen to it even if it was a dud because you spent money on it, but stuff like that happens.

The internet has simplified a lot of the effort, but most people just spent time doing other things and it would come along in its own way. A lot of underground music had diy grass roots style efforts, so eventually people into it would post ads in magazines and communicate through mail and such things to spread the word.",2025-04-18 12:30:32,1,ForestPoetry,music

Cassettes quickly transitioned to CDs which were really cool. Just collecting them and organizing them in your CD Folder. Extra points form keeps CD Booklet with the CD in there.

Go to the mall with family and hide away at the music store sampling every CD you could grab then run over to the scanner.

And then the artist gods took pity on us and started compiling projects as entire works of art and each single was then picked for quality and quantity but always in the one genre. But, it was still analog and once the record got scratched, you had to buy another one.

Then the format changed to CDs and, except for people with very sensitive ears, we were happy. 

You could go into record stores and listen to the entire CD before you bought it. 

Then folks started uploading music illegally and we started downloading that music illegally and we were extremely happy.

mnnck95,1k1lzqe,reddit,"Terrific band, and I've got a fun story to share.

I often work with an AV team putting on conferences all over North America and Europe. One of the AV guys is a big DBT fan, and he knows I am too, and we're down in a hotel ballroom at 6 am doing soundchecks and what-have-you, and so he's playing some of their stuff while he's checking whatever it is sound guys check early in the morning.

""Hey, want to hear something cool?"" He asks. Of course I say yes, and he plays a song that I've heard many, many times before. ""Hear that kind of whine in there?"" He asks.

""Yeah?"" I say. It's something that when someone points it out to you, you can't not hear it.

""I know they did this song in the studio in one take, because that sound is a mistake. That's a pedal effect a lot of guitarists use to dirty-up their sound at the start of a piece, but you're supposed to turn it off once the band gets going. They forgot to do that here. They must have liked this take enough to use it over the objections of the audio engineer in the booth.""

""Why? What's the big deal?"" I ask.

""It's exactly the same noise speakers make when they're about to blow.""

Within ten seconds of explaining that to me, the AV guy's boss —a very AV tech savvy guy himself— walks into the hotel ballroom and loses his goddamn mind. ""What is that? Is that our shit? Shut it down! Shut it all down right now!"" He's thinking all of their equipment is about to destroy itself, and they've got only a few seconds to kill the power and figure out what's gone wrong.

So I'm laughing my head off, and the AV guy is trying to explain through my laughter that it's on the album he's playing, and the boss is not calming down. ""Who the fuck would put out an album with that sound on it?""

I wish to God I remember which song it was. I don't remember it being a super-deep cut.",2025-04-17 20:34:04,2,faceintheblue,music

mnibkpr,1k102tc,reddit,"The Smithereens' performance of ""Only A Memory"" and ""A Girl Like You"" on MTV Unplugged in 1995 is notable not only for its musical quality but also because ""A Girl Like You"" was originally intended to be the title track for Cameron Crowe's film ""Say Anything..."". This performance highlights the band's influence in the late '80s and early '90s power pop scene, which was characterized by catchy melodies and a retro sound reminiscent of the British Invasion.

I was 19. Living in a bad situation in the middle of nowhere. I was a musician recording on a fourtrack in my bedroom. All music i was exposed to was just the same regurgitated garbage. Everything seemed to be degrading, in terms of my life and the new music i was finding. I was just done with the world entirely. I was sinking bad into depression and had a loose ""plan"".

One night, the people I was living with got direct tv installed. I sat in one of their bedrooms and we turned on Much Music and the video for Maps came on. It blew me away. I had never heard anything like it. I had never even thought to rip lead parts on a low E. The song was heartbreaking and uplifting and FRESH. 

It didnt cure me or anything, but it instantly changed the way I was thinking about music, which led to more recording experimentation, which led to making new life changes, evemtually moving out, starting a band, and taking back my life.

I met new people because of that. Met the person i married because of that. Went back to college because of that. On and on and on.

mklxgkc,1jnnpxb,reddit,"For the best quality, you typically want the 24bit versions of songs, which you can stream or purchase online. Not because 24bit is technically better or more capable than 16bit, but rather because we in the audio engineering world put the best sounding masters out as 24bit for discerning listeners, and hyped/mangled versions out as 16 bit and mp3 quality to provide instant gratification for the masses. ""24 bit"" is essentially a proxy for ""we didn't distort the fuck out of this version"".

CD releases will tend to have the same 16bit masters as Spotify/Youtube, just with less artifacts - i.e. they will be just as loud, unless you go hunt secondhand stores for old copies from the early 90s.

Vinyl can *sometimes* sound better than 24 bit releases, but it's fairly rare. Music gets so hugely twisted when physically carved into vinyl that to make a 24 bit digital release sound worse than vinyl, the engineer really has to be a muppet.

There are some esoteric physical formats like dsd, but they are rare and expensive, and of very marginal improvement over a 24bit stream.

Qobuz is my service of choice for 24bit streaming. It's very seldom I find myself wanting to listen to a different master to what they have.",2025-03-31 00:30:02,1,f10101,music

mkehuoa,1jmtj31,reddit,"I believe the answer is compression, and the trend towards tighter, more compressed mixes to get the “punchiest” possible sound. Punch = attention grabbing = streams/radio play/etc.

If everything is mixed to be up-front and in your face, a byproduct for some people is that it may also sound flatter and narrower. This is of course far from a universal rule and you can find plenty of current artists creating wide, rich soundscapes. But it’s true as a general trend in mainstream music, and especially rock. 

A good anecdote for this: some buddies and I did mushrooms and put on Abraxas by Santana and went on an absolute journey. When the album ended, it auto-played straight into Smooth by Santana featuring Rob Thomas and the change in vibe was JARRING. Super compressed, tight 2000’s pop. It pulled us right out of the moment and we even started poo-pooing on the decline in quality, but after a minute or so our ears adjusted and we ended up bopping SO hard to Smooth.

mkf4sc5,1jmtj31,reddit,"There are some pretty good answers here.  I will repeat what many people have said, it is an issue with loudness trying to make each track recorded sound bigger, but you're still working on the same soundscape.  Therefore, every track that you try to increase dynamics through compression, you are taking away from every other track the more you do so.

Picutre lets say a farmers field, and each blade of grass is using compression to make an independent track, and being manipulated to sound bigger, louder, more punch etc.   With every blade of grass you manipulate to sound louder and stick out more in the mix, you are taking dynamics from every other blade of grass around that.

As a farmer, or mixer, you still only have that certain section of land to represent the amounts of blades of grass, and it is done artificially with compression in the mix to make it pop out and be distinct.  When you use that whole damn field of grass to make a half dozen, or two dozens of audio tracks to compete, the overall effect is a lack of dynamics, not an increase of them.  Therefore the whole mixed track sounds more flat, where if you weren't trying to increase all audio's dynamics using compression, which actually reduces dynamics the more you increase the volume.

  
This is why when you listen to a 3 or 4 piece band with a relatively simple mix, say, Led Zeppelin of old or more recent Chilly Peppers Blood Sugar Sex Magic.  Both pretty simple analog mixes.  Those albums slam HARD when played through a decent system.  But, they may not translate as well into a smart phone speaker unless they are remastered for that.  This is why all those classic records have been remastered, because we are no longer listening on 8 tracks, records, cassettes, mp3's, and more recent medias.  They all act differently on devices, formats, peoples preferences for playback devices etc etc.

  
Its very easy to over compress and make a track sound loud.  It takes much more skill to keep the overhead down and make sure every track has the appropriate headroom in the mix to not overpower, and have to use compression, to squish all of the overpowered tracks down into one wav of music.

  
There is a reason the people that understand this make a lot of damn money and reputation over their career.  It is in my opinion that after everything went digital since the 90's, that many 'producers' went this route.   As the same that for say 90's to 2000's rock, every damn band used the same drum mixes and sampling for pretty much  every band in the period.  It was drag and drop samples, and all the big pop./rock drum sounds were the exact same samples.

mowstai,1k79w2i,reddit,"Frank Sinatra is an interesting one because he was often releasing three different styles at once.

For example, in the fifties at Capitol he was releasing:

1) Cool-as-fuck up-tempo swing albums like [Songs for Swingin' Lovers!](https://open.spotify.com/album/1cyjTcGVa3GqOSFBK0EhWR) made by covering old songs from the Great American Songbook,

2) Depressing late-night lonely suicidal albums like [In the Wee Small Hours](https://open.spotify.com/album/3GmwKB1tgPZgXeRJZSm9WX),

3) While simultaneously releasing a long string of schmaltzy newly-written pop singles like [Flowers Mean Forgiveness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BM5iXjSlSOs), often featuring old-fashioned backing singers that makes them sound outdated.

It can make it hard for people first getting into his music. For example, you might think that the compilation ""The Complete Capitol Singles Collection"" would be a good introduction to Sinatra, but—with the notable exception of the extraordinary swing number [I've Got The World On A String](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo0Ukgsmb6w)—it's mostly songs in Category 3, which will turn off many listeners.",2025-04-25 03:28:02,9,RunDNA,music

I don’t have children and I probably never will (by choice), but when I listen to this song I think how beautiful motherhood could be. 

It might be too heavy so I’ll also suggest “Daddy’s Song” by Harry Nilsson.

If this song is too loud, maybe the new children’s album by John Legend. It’s called “My Favorite Dream” and it’s produced by Sufjan Stevens. It’s delightful.

If these are all a bust, how about “Sea of Love.” 

“Do you remember when we met? That’s the day I knew you were my pet. I want to tell you how much I love you.” ❤️

If your looking for something calm and classical, I’d recommend Debussy since it’s not as repetitive and nerve wracking as some other classical music when driving.

Anyway, congratulations! You’re obviously going to be great/ thoughtful parents.

The music and lyrics are out there and is kind of thought provoking, or at least compared to ""Rock You Like a Hurricane"" and all the other garbage 96.1 KLPX plays.  I was hooked on Zappa pretty early, but my music listening habits push me to check out entirely new music and Zappa as well as Young and everyone else I like a lot sit on my shelves with just a few discs.  His massive discography is impressive and I would love to have everything he released, if for nothing other than the accomplishment of collecting the complete set.

I was talking music with a coworker and he let me borrow his big cd book and this was the first CD in the book, and the very first song (fittingly titled ""The First Single"") had me hooked from the very first note.

I had a pretty wide range of music I enjoyed up to that point (emo, hip hop, some classic rock and pop, etc) but that was the first time I was like ""ohhh THIS is what it feels like to listen to music that feels like it's made *for me*.""

I fell in love with Nate Reuss's voice, his evocative tone and lyrics that were somehow both melancholy and uplifting at the same time.

This album, and this band (and Nate's subsequent project, fun.), helped me mold my outlook on life itself. I had been full of teen angst and anger, and listening to these songs helped me refocus that perspective into feeling like I was ""for"" something rather than ""against"" something.

Their songs didn't invalidate sadness and suffering and struggle, but didn't swim in it either. They helped show me a path toward finding something worth smiling about, and that I would rather look forward (but still remember and honor the past) than turn around and completely immerse myself in the things that had already occured.

I love this album, I love this band, and so much of the music I love today is a direct result of finding the path opened to me by the experience of listening to this for the first time.",2025-04-19 17:47:11,1,f_teve,music

mlzsu6t,1ju11ft,reddit,"You're asking the wrong question.

Trying out random albums won't get you anywhere in the long run.

Try focusing on artists/musicians.

First, pick an artist you like and deep dive their entire catalog. This builds an appreciation of how artists exist beyond just their hits and helps you understand the larger picture of how musicians evolve and change.

Then start digging through credits. Very few musicians have existed in isolation. See what other groups the individual musicians played in. Check out which other albums the producer and engineer worked on. Listen to other acts on the same label. This involves you in the larger music ecosystem.

This will build a foundation to your music appreciation instead of just throwing darts at the wall.",2025-04-08 06:30:22,2,virtualbeggar,music

I love the album and I think it is one of the best rock albums of all-time, but that song really does sound more like a weak intro rather than a standalone single track. I actually thought it was an intro until they released it as a single. I don't like the orchestra sound and all of the strings in it. It sounds overproduced. It doesn't fit on the album, and if I were to introduce someone to the album for the first time I would probably say, ""Pay no mind to this track. The album gets much better, just trust me on this one.""",2025-04-03 22:23:20,0,Smoothsailing4589,music

As for folk music, he is the real deal. It was an honor to be on stage with him and a joy to watch him perform. This was in the late 90s when he was touring with Terry Talbot. They did Christian music mostly, but it had the deep, down heart of activist folk music in it.

Amazing stuff. 

He sang this song to us on the tour bus.
