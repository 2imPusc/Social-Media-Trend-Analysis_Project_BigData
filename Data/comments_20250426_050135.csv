We had to bake them for 30min and didn’t add anything extra. The 25min mark seemed a little undercooked but not giggly. Additionally, we used ghee instead of butter. We only have a glass 9x13. 

Also, we have air tight glass containers. Do you store them in room temperature or fridge?

mkmzwar,1jngk75,reddit,"Well done on the process. Mine and most people's favorite of the various 'cello experiments I've made is Lemon-Tangerine-Grapefruit. 


Tangerine zest have better flavor than oranges for some reason, and you get more zest per pound of fruit depending on varieties[I microplane, but I've never tried cutting the zest off smoothing that small and squishy. The grapefruit oils give you that light numbing tingling on the edges of your palate, depending on the amount in the ratio used, that is quite nice.  ",2025-03-31 04:59:10,2,Brownlee_42,food

mlvkgi2,1jtndek,reddit,"Dough ingredients (Baker’s %):

    •550 grams of high gluten flour (100%)
    •347 grams of filtered water (63%) 
    •15 grams of sea salt (2.7%)
    •10 grams of sugar (1.8%)
    •10 grams of barley malt (1.8%) (optional)
    •11 grams of extra virgin olive oil (2%) 
    •0.75 grams of instant dry yeast (0.1%)

Mix water (100°F) yeast, salt and sugar

Put the flour in a stand mixer bowl, set mixer to 1 and add the malt (if using). Slowly add water. Once water is incorporated add the oil and mix for 8 minutes on setting 1, the dough should just start to be getting smooth (I don’t know if it does anything but I like to gently scrape the dough off the hook a few times during this step). Alternatively hand knead for 12 minutes

Cover and let the dough rest for 15 minutes.

Do a serious of stretch and folds to incorporate air, place the dough back into the mixing bowl, cover and rest for 10-15 minutes. If the dough is smooth move on, if not do another series of stretch and folds, cover and allow to rest another 10-15 minutes. Ball and bulk rest the dough in a covered bowl for 5-11 hours.

Ferment at room temp for about 24 hours total. This will give you the flavor of a longer cold ferment but with stronger gluten. In my experience there is nothing special about fermenting in the fridge for an extended period of time, I get quicker and better results by fermenting at room temp.

After the bulk ferment, divide your dough into two equal portions (about 460 grams each). Ball the dough until it’s smooth, if you’re not getting a smooth ball try gently doing some stretch and folds to incorporate more air and try balling again. You want the dough to be smooth and tight. Place each dough ball into a lightly greased sealable container, preferably round and large enough so the dough can double in size. Place in a safe spot to finish fermenting at room temperature (24 hours total including the bulk ferment)

Find a block of low-moisture full-fat mozzarella and shred, dice or tear by hand. I use about 190-200 grams (6.87 ounces) per 16” pizza, but this should be adjusted to personal preference. Sometimes I’ll do about 80/20 mozz/provolone mix. Always get good cheese and never buy pre shredded

I also use pecorino or Parmesan, or a mix. Preferably hand shredded, about 20 grams.

Cook using your preferred method, I used an Ooni Koda 16 on low after preheating on high for 30 mins.

\*I normally use lower hydration (58%) but experimented with higher, forgot to compare results but this came out fantastic",2025-04-07 15:24:00,61,hey_im_cool,food

I make sure to get one of each every year.  Not the cheapest but it's NYC and also a street fair so that's how it goes.

mkhbig3,1jmqd4i,reddit,"Regarding the wraps: A few months ago, I realized I'd never made a pinwheel or wrap so I looked up a few vids on YouTube and then made some for dinner. The guides I followed said after filling, roll and wrap tightly in cling film and then refrigerate for 1 hour so that everything would hold together. Even so, wben I tried cutting them into pinwheels and transferred them to my dinner plate, much of the filling fell out. I thought ""Ok, I'll just leave the others as whole wraps"" but still a considerable amount of filling out dropped out/squeezed out of the open rear end as they were being eaten.

So, my question is when you are prepping these in great volume, do you individually wrap each roll or do you have a better process - and what's the key to ensuring the filling stays put?",2025-03-30 06:26:15,3,DanielB_CANADA,food

mkcxoke,1jmn1mn,reddit,"255 grams all purpose flour 

15g sugar

1 tablespoon baking powder

1/2 teaspoon baking soda

6g kosher salt

110g unsalted butter - I use either Costco Kirkland or Kerry Gold 

255g greek yogurt 

**2-3 book folds if you want layers or not

Instructions: 
1. Preheat oven to 400F
2. Cut butter into 1 inch cubes 
3. In a mixing bowl, combine, and mix dry ingredients. 
4. Add butter and press flour into the butter until the pieces are about the size of peas. 
5. Add in green yogurt, mix until dough is hydrated and forms.
6. Let the dough rest in the fridge if the dough feels warm.
7. Optional but if you want distinct layers, do the book fold method 2-3 times. 
8. Roll out the dough and thickness should be about 3/4-1inch. (You can use flour to dust but just be sure to brush off any extra before putting them into the pan)
9. My picture shows 7 biscuits in a 10 inch cast iron pan but you can cut them evenly to 6 or 8!
10. Bake until 190-200F internal temp.",2025-03-29 14:20:57,138,bamboo_time,food

mmbhtk0,1jvjzsw,reddit,"32oz room temp cream cheese 2/3 cup sour cream 4 large eggs room temp 1 cup sugar 1 and 1/2 teaspoons vanilla 1/8th teaspoon salt

The crust is

1 stick butter melted 1 and 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs 1 tablespoon brown sugar 1 and 1/2 tablespoons sugar

Pre heat oven to 325.

Mix all crust ingredients together and layer them into the bottom and sides of your spring pan.

If you have a stand mixer combining the cheesecake ingredients will be easier. Mix the cream cheese until smooth, then add the sugar and mix again.

After that add the salt, vanilla and sour cream. Then finally the eggs. I’d add them one at a time, and don’t beat the batter too much, you really don’t want a lot of air added to the mix.

I baked this one for about 55 minutes and then let it set for about 4 hours.

The strawberry topping is one crate of fresh copped strawberries, about a half cup of water, and some lemon juice; cooked down in a pot. I added, if I had to guess, like half cup sugar (I kind of eye balled that one). Then in a bowl with another about half cup of water I mixed in a few spoon fulls of corn starch, and then added that mixture to the pot. I let it cook down until it thickened up to how I wanted it.

The topping was kind of an afterthought :)

Hopefully I this is helpful

The fish should be whole, not in 3 separate chunks. 

Unfortunately they are not chips, they are fries.

The sauce looks weird, can’t tell if it’s meant to be tartar sauce or curry sauce (I’ll go for tartar sauce based on what looks like chopped herb-Inclusion) but the colour is way off regardless.

You need malt vinegar and If possible some white sliced bread. 

Mushy peas should be included.

Chaat masala by itself is so flavorful, how would the pork shoulder stand against it? I mean, pork shoulder is great but a vastly more subtle flavor even with the orange and cumin seasoning. And saffron chicken salad is a taste I have no experience in, except that saffron is again, a very innocuous flavor.

Holy moly is this thing moist! I am happy to report that I think this might be the best carrot cake I’ve had! I followed recipe to the T. Here’s the recipe from the video:

⸻

Carrot Cake

Mix-ins:
	•	3 cups (300g) grated carrots
	•	1 cup chopped pecans

	5.	Add Mix-ins: Fold in grated carrots, chopped pecans, and raisins.
	6.	Bake: Divide batter evenly into the prepared pans. Bake for 35 to 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
	7.	Cool: Let cakes cool in pans for 10 mins, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely (at least 15 mins).

⸻

mm5qrf4,1juk1y5,reddit,"Sooo, no recipe then? :(  I'm mostly interested in a good recipe for a marinara, and yours looks great! I don't see any Italian parsley. What are your opinions on that? It seems like something you would've experimented with. Skim or whole mozz (I'm assuming here)? What types of bread have you tried, and which do you prefer? I don't see any garlic, but maybe it's just under all the cheese. What types are you using? I'll show you mine the hopes that you'll show us yours.

1.5 C shredded part skim mozzarella or Monterey jack  

Chopped Italian Parsley - Honestly never weighed this, but when mixed it should look like there will be a couple of pieces every  1""x1"", but really a person preference.  

1.5 Tbsp store bought minced garlic (plus/minus .5 Tsp depending on preference)  

1.5 Tbsp salted butter  

1.5 Tbsp Mayo  

1 tsp Cholula (hot sauce optional)  


Using the back end of a spoon, or other similar tool, mix until combined and it looks like a spread/paste. This can then be refrigerated, but needs to be soft enough to spread easily onto the bread. Spread a layer onto the bread. The thickness is up to you, but I find it can depend on the thickness of the bread. I like a thinner layer in general. Cook in the oven at 380F for 10-12 minutes. I prefer the oven to an air fryer, but air frying is generally 3-4 mins at 360. My local Whole Foods sells a croissant bread, which of course the best bread I have tried.

I just watched your videos for fun and before I even started cooking, I knew how to do it and approach it and it just felt super easy!

I’ve always wondered about the process of how you make your recipes. Is there a lot of trial and error with getting the correct ingredient amounts? The thing I love about your videos is that you give us a lot of ways to adjust the recipe to our liking with ingredient amounts and substitutions, but what is your process for creating a concrete recipe for your website and when do you say “alright, this is the final version of this recipe that I’m going to publish”?",2025-03-26 16:08:20,168,icywing54,food

mjwmfz4,1jkck6n,reddit,"Chef John! - 

What a chance to reach out to someone that's _actually_ influenced me and my life in tremendous ways. I'm a middle aged man, and have been a ""home cook"" for 12 years. My friends think of me as some chef (I'm -so- not). The reality is, I just watch your videos (and some others), find commonalities, and kind of figure it out from there. I use you as a guide, not an absolute, and that's been great. You've enabled me to bring so much joy to not only myself, but the people who grace me with their presence and allow me to cook for them in my home.  

I -really- appreciate how you teach techniques, and encourage people to experiment. I also DEEPLY value that the only thing that's changed over the 12+ years I've been watching is that the video quality and general editing has gotten better. No fancy and silly animations or sound effects, no skits, no celebrities showing up, no ""omgggggggg sooo good"" reaction faces, and no ""I rated the top 10 _____"" nonsense. Just food. Just lessons. Just the info we so deeply want without the noise trying to be ""viral"". I sincerely believe the reason your channel is one I'll always come back to is because you're true, honest, and you don't waiver. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT.

**Now, a question :**

It seems you do very little ""baking"" as part of your repertoire. I know cooking is kind of like art, and baking more of a science. Would you ever consider bringing more ""baking"" type things into your videos? Things like a chicken pot pie crust, or Yorkshire puddings, or working with philo and puff pasty? I know you touch on it a bit, but would you be willing to explore that more? And, by extension, are there some other less talked about topics you'd really like to get into in the coming year(s)?

Thank you again for everything you're doing. It's a great service to us all, and it's enabled me to live a happier, healthier, and far more enjoyable life with food.",2025-03-26 21:28:24,61,ilovedillpickles,food

My favorites of yours are your homemade marinara and your fresh garden tomato sauce (those are just the top favorites; I have many others). The latter will be used to make tonight's dinner, in fact!

Change very little, save cooking it to (more or less) the same temperature only **in a hotter oven**.  That way you get a little more browning on your pastry dough.

mmgiz2b,1jw8xdk,reddit,"Quick notes:

\- Had some sausage to kill off, some garlic, lemons, parm, eggs - lets try something lol

\- Timing this meal can turn it into a 25min cook time - it's a matter of juggling the prep, boiling water, starting the pasta, begin frying, finish pasta as the frying completes.

\- 4 eggs, about 200g of diced sausage, a good handful of parm, half to a full lemon's of grated rind (go lighter, it's not exactly subtle and can become a bit bitter), 2 cloves of minced garlic, and a knob of butter. I also tacked in a bit of thyme and some smoked paprika for colour.

\- Whipped the eggs with grated parm, added the thyme and a bit of paprika.

\- Fired off on the sausage, lightly frying it until browning a bit, throw in garlic, fry together.

\- Cooked the pasta goes into the pan, with a bit of pasta water, along with the whipped egg, parm, over a low heat. As the bit of pasta water reduces through the egg, I added a knob of butter.

\- Let it all come together in the pan, stirring gently but constantly as to not let the egg cook like scramble, but reduce to a creamy texture.

\- Serve immediately. To taste, a dash of pepper, and a little squeeze of fresh lemon juice.

Result: after eating it, it's fine, but ya, half a lemon rind, and only one garlic clove. Different sausage, too. Could have been better,",2025-04-10 21:22:11,22,crimsontape,food

mkefbo7,1jmjq20,reddit,"Adding more details for those interested, couldn't edit my original post:

I spent a few hours last weekend peeling, mincing and freezing garlic. Had company and help to keep it fun :)

We started with app. 6,5 kg (over 14 lbs) of fresh farmer's market garlic and we still have a bunch left over.

Didn't use any special hacks for peeling, the garlic was lovely and peeled easily.

Ingredients: 

* 4-5 Pound Whole Chicken
* 3 tbsp Butter
* 2 tbsp Olive Oil
* 2 tsp Salt
* 1 tsp Pepper
* 3 Cloves of garlic, minced or grated
* 1-2 onions quartered

* **Preheat** your oven to 325°F. Prepare your roasting pan or a large cast-iron or heavy pan by laying out the quartered onions in a circle on the bottom of the pan.
* **Pat the chicken dry** with paper towels and place it on top of the quartered onions.
* **In a small bowl**, mix together the olive oil, minced garlic, salt, and pepper. **Rub the garlic oil mixture** generously all over the chicken, including under the skin and inside the cavity if possible.
* Add the 3 tablespoons of butter to the top of the chicken and r**oast** uncovered for 2.5 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F and the skin is deeply golden and crisp.
* **Let rest** for 10–15 minutes before carving to lock in all the juices.",2025-04-16 19:32:40,12,lonelyisland789,food

mnkyzz5,1k14zxt,reddit,"I'd eat that! Nice!

A couple of tips...

When you cut the fat, do it in a nice and tight diamond pattern, i.e. don't do the cuts a right angles...

Then, get the kettle on and boil some water. Put the duck breasts onto a rack over the sink and pour some boiling water over the skin/fat side only.

You'll see that it will dissolve some of the fat and contract the rest.

Pat the duck dry and now start in a cold dry skillet (no added fat), skin side down on a low heat.

Slowly let most of the fat render out, that will be plenty to provide you with all the fat you need to cook.
Then turn up the heat a little, and once the skin is nicely golden and crispy, you can flip the duck and add your thyme.

Pat the skin side with a paper towel for some extra crisp, don't baste, it's not a steak and it'll just get your nicely crispy skin soggy again.

Cook another couple of minutes until nice and pink, remove from skillet and let rest.

Now do your sauce, add a little butter, fresh orange juice, splash of lemon, and reduce while the duck is resting.

If you're feeling fancy, strain your sauce to get the bits of thyme out... Season to taste with salt, pepper (and a little sugar if you like it a little sweater). 

Optionally flambé with a dash of Grand Marnier or Southern Comfort or some orange liqueur.

Same ingredients, nothing fancy, just a little added technique and you'll have your dish at the next level!

Keep going!",2025-04-17 13:32:54,45,funwithtentacles,food

    2 lbs. ground chicken
    2 large eggs, slightly beaten
    3 cloves garlic, minced
    3 Tbsp. olive oil
    1 cup seasoned panko crumbs
    3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
    1 tsp. onion powder
    1 tsp. kosher salt
    1 tsp. black pepper
    1/2 tsp. paprika

Sauce:

    5 Tbsp. butter
    4 cloves garlic, minced
    2 tsp. Italian seasoning
    1/4-1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes, add to your liking
    1 cup sundried tomatoes in oil, drained and roughly chopped
    1/4 cup white cooking wine
    1 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
    1 cup heavy cream
    2/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
    8-10 fresh basil leaves, julienned, if desired for garnish

Instructions
 
Chicken Meatballs

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Lined an extra large baking sheet or two large baking sheets with parchment paper. Set aside.

In a large bowl, combine all ingredients for meatballs and gently mix together. Do not over mix. Use a 1 1/2-inch scooper and scoop meatballs onto trays. Bake for 18 minutes until lightly browned and no longer pink inside. Remove from oven and set aside while you make the sauce.

Sauce

In a large oven-proof deep skillet, melt butter over medium heat.

Add the garlic, Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes and sundried tomatoes and cook over medium heat, stirring often for 2 minutes. Add the wine and cook for 2-3 minutes until mostly cooked down. Add the chicken broth, then slowly add the heavy cream and Parmesan and whisk until well combined. Continue to cook until sauce starts to thicken slightly, stirring occasionally.

Add the meatballs to the sauce and mix until the meatballs are well coated. Transfer the skillet to the oven and cook for about 10 minutes until the meatballs are heated through and the sauce is bubbly. Serve immediately.",2025-04-17 13:43:25,5,Fredi_ManYeti,food

mmzu9vp,1jynsbq,reddit,"Checked off a bucket list cooking item this weekend by making ramen from scratch for the first time. Came across u/Ramen_Lord's miso recipe on Friday morning and ended up here on Sunday night. I followed his recipe basically to the letter as best I could minus the sesame seeds in the tare and the bean sprouts in the vegetable topping because the selection at my local Asian grocery store didn't look so hot. Also, my grocery store didn't have enough pork neck bones for the required 4 pounds, so I subbed in some unsmoked hocks to make up the difference. 

All in all, it was a lot of work, but it was incredible and well worth the effort. I should have added more soy to the tare for my personal tastes, and I should have bit the bullet and made a full chachu instead of the little mini bois I did. Bought pre sliced pork belly and rolled the slices up to have a few smaller ones, which worked, but I would have liked some more in my bowl. I will 100% be making more ramen in the future.

mmi7xkn,1jwgh5n,reddit,"Tonkatsu

Score the fatty edge to avoid cupping, salt and dry brine for a few hours, then bake in a 250°F oven until 130°F internal. Flour > beaten egg > panko, frying at 375°F until browned and internal reaches preferred temp, I like 145 to 150°F. 

Tonkatsu sauce

½ cup ketchup 

2 tsp Worcestershire

2 tbs shoyu 

2 tsp sugar, my preferred ketchup is low sugar

1 tsp grated ginger

1 tsp grated garlic

1 tbs mirin 

Mix well and keep in the fridge, I did this when I put the chops in the oven. 

Cabbage

I bought a nifty cabbage shredder, so fun but up until now using a sharp knife has worked just fine! Shred into ice water. Normally I don't think it's dressed but a toss in some rice vinegar helps to cut through the heavy meal. 


Rice

Use your fav, I'm partial to Nishiki sushi rice.

mkjd8hi,1jnfv88,reddit,"**Spaghetti and Meatballs (serves four)**

**Meatballs**

+ 500g beef mince (or 1/2 beef and 1/2 pork)
+ 1/2 an onion, finely diced
+ 2 large cloves of garlic, grated
+ 2 tbsp grated parmesan (parmigiano-reggiano)
+ 2 tbsp parsley, finely chopped
+ 1 egg
+ 1 thick slice or bread, blitzed to breadcrumbs
+ 4 tbsp of milk
+ 3/4 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper, chilli flakes and pinch of nutmeg

+ Soak breadcrumbs in milk for 10 minutes. Saute onions until softened.
+ Squeeze breadcrumbs to get rid of excess milk, and add all other ingredients. Mix until homogeneous.
+ Use an ice cream scoop or tablespoon to devide mixture into balls. Dip the spoon/scoop into some water between each scoop to stop the mixture from sticking. If using an ice cream scoop, half each ball.
+ Using slightly damp hands, roll each ball until smooth. You should now have about 20 meatballs. Rest them in a fridge while you make your sauce.

**Tomato Sauce**

+ 2 400g tins of tomatoes
+ 1 onion, chopped
+ 3 cloves of garlic, minced
+ 1 tbsp tomato puree
+ 1/2 tsp chilli flakes
+ 1/2 tsp dried thyme
+ 1/2 tsp dried oregano
+ 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar, 1 tsp honey

+ Saute onion until translucent. Add garlic and chilli flakes and fry for a minute. 
+ Add tomato puree and fry for a minute before adding the other ingredients and half a tin of water.
+ Add a pinch of salt and pepper and simmer for 30 minutes.

+ While you sauce is simmering, either fry or grill (broil) the meatballs until browned on both sides, drain on kitchen roll to get rid of excess grease.
+ Add the meatballs to the sauce and simmer for a further 30 minutes.
+ 10 minutes before the meatballs are done, boil your spaghetti in salted water until al dente, use 100-125g per person. Reserve the pasta water.
+ Remove the meatballs from the sauce, check sauce for seasoning and add your spaghetti. Mix until the sauce is coating the spaghetti, add some pasta water as needed to get the desired consistency.
+ Devide the spaghetti between four plates and top with the meatballs.
+ Garnish with chopped parsley or basil and grated parmesan. Enjoy!",2025-03-30 16:13:44,3,SquareGoYaBam,food

The buttermilk leftover from making butter, isn't currently the typical Buttermilk used to make biscuits/pancakes/etc.

It is natural buttermilk, but what's typically used today is Cultured Buttermilk. So while it serves the same purpose, it won't really have the same result (missing the tang).

mlxtrde,1jty3no,reddit,"When the days say 10 days let it go as long as you’re comfortable. Just make sure to Ph it for safety. This one went 35 days

Lacto fermented habanero sauce/salsa

1 lb habanero peppers (any peppers)(destemmed you can deseed if needed I don’t.)

1 large white onion (sliced to fit through mason jar opening)

1 whole garlic bulb

1 large red bell pepper (or any color but green bell)

24 grams Canning salt

1 quart cool Filtered water

1 - half gallon wide mouth ball jar

Dark room temp location for 10 days

To do:

Wash all peppers.

Peel garlic and add to jar

Slice bell pepper into slices that will fit into jar I usually cut into 8ths.

Slice onion same way to fit through mouth of jar

Add habanero to jar

Top with glass puck and press if needed to acquire more space. You want to leave about a half inch to inch in the top.

Mix salt and water together until salt dissolves. Pour brine into jar until it covers the glass puck.

Seal with ferment lids and use pump to remove excess air from jar. Place in a dark, room temp location undisturbed for 10 days. You can peek at the jar and see if there are bubbles forming and floating to the top. This means it’s working! Just don’t open it!

After 10 days remove lid and assess. If done properly there may be some white film residue or what appears to be sea foam on the sides. This is a byproduct of some fermentations and is called Kahm yeast, perfectly harmless and naturally occurring. As long as there is no color (green, black) the mold can be wiped away.

Strain the fermented pepper mix to over a large bowl and collect the fermented brine. Add the pepper mix to a blender. (Watch the fumes they’ll gas you) blend and slowly add more brine to reach the desired consistency. You can save any left over brine and add cucumbers to make some spicy pickles or what ever you want.

Refrigerate after bottling. Serve chilled. Do not cook the salsa as it will lose any probiotic value. Chilled shelf life at least 6 months. But I have never had it last that long. Shits good yo.",2025-04-07 22:26:32,15,t-o-m-u-s-a,food

24 Oreo cookies

5 tablespoons butter unsalted, melted

Cheesecake filling

1½ pounds cream cheese softened, 3–8-ounce bricks

1 pound strawberries hulled

1¼ cup sugar

¾ cup heavy cream

¼ cup sour cream

2 tablespoons water cold or room temperature

7 g unflavored gelatin one package



INSTRUCTIONS
 
Blooming the gelatin
In a small bowl sprinkle, the gelatin over the cold/room temperature water. Allow to sit for 5 minutes.


Heat the gelatin in the microwave until liquid, about 30-45 seconds, set aside and allow it to cool.

Making the crust
While the gelatin is blooming add the Oreos to a food processor and pulse until they are crumbs. Add the butter and pulse to combine.


Pour the crust into a parchment lined springform pan. Press down to firmly pack the crust and place it in the refrigerator.

Making the strawberry cheesecake filling
In a food processor pulse the strawberries until they are smooth. Add the sour cream, sugar, gelatin, and cream cheese. Blend until evenly combined.

In a mixing bowl using a hand mixer whip the cream until soft peaks form. Pour in the cheesecake filling and gently fold to combine. Pour the filling into the chilled springform pan, Cover and chill for at least 6 hours to overnight.",2025-04-12 23:20:20,16,ManMeetsOven,food

Stale panko bread crumbs soaked in milk
Broiled on high for colour 

Sauce
Romas, grape tomatoes
Tomato paste
Onions
Garlic
Lots of oil
Sugar

Sauce I always start with half inch of oil, and I essentially lightly fry the tomatoes and onions, I don’t mix it as to prevent any contact of sauce and the heavy bottom pan. I learned this from YouTube: cookinginfinland. Then once it’s ready I add the paste and mix through",2025-04-13 14:51:04,6,A_Venger,food

Season the meat side. I used 5-spice, sugar, salt, pepper, and garlic powder.

Brush the skin with vinegar (I used rice vinegar but any white vinegar will work) and add some salt (some use a salt cap but I just add salt to taste).

In an air fryer, cook for 30 minutes at 95 C to dry out the skin

Brush some oil on the skin (not necessary if you poked the holes) and cook for another 30 minutes at 200 C.

Combine peppercorns, sugar and salt. Place 2 or 3 sprigs of dill in the bottom of a nonreactive baking dish. Sprinkle about ¼ cup of salt mixture over the bottom of the dish. 

Place the salmon, skin side down, on top of the salt and dill, and place a few more sprigs of dill on top of the salmon. Sprinkle all over with another ¼ cup of the salt mixture. 

Cover and refrigerate overnight.

Pour off accumulated liquid. Refill the dish with fresh salt and dill, as before. Cover and refrigerate overnight.

Repeat twice more over two more days.

When salmon is cured, rinse thoroughly and pat dry. Place on a drying rack and refrigerate uncovered overnight.

mncffp7,1k095lt,reddit,"**Strawberry Puree:**
- 1 pound (454g) fresh strawberries, rinsed and hulled
**Cake:**
- 2 and 1/2 cups (285g) cake flour (spooned & leveled)
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 3/4 cup (12 Tbsp; 170g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
- 1 and 3/4 cups (350g) granulated sugar
- 5 large egg whites, at room temperature
- 1/3 cup (75g) sour cream or plain yogurt, at room temperature
- 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup (120ml) whole milk, at room temperature*
- 1/2 cup reduced strawberry puree (see step 1)
- optional: 1–2 drops red or pink food coloring

**Instructions:**
Make the reduced strawberry puree first, and let cool: Puree 1 pound of rinsed and hulled strawberries. You should have a little over 1 cup. Stirring occasionally, simmer the puree over medium-low heat until you’re left with 1/2 cup (about 135g) or slightly more (you need 1/2 cup for the cake). This takes at least 25–35 minutes, but could take longer depending on your pan or how juicy your strawberries were. Allow to cool completely before using in cake batter. I always make the reduced puree the day before so it has plenty of time to cool down. I cover and place in the refrigerator overnight. Allow it to come back to room temperature before adding to the cake batter. (See Notes for further make-ahead instructions.)
Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease two 9-inch round cake pans, line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans. (If it’s helpful, see this parchment paper rounds for cakes video & post.)
Make the cake: Whisk the cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together. Set aside.
Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed until smooth and creamed, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a silicone spatula as needed. Beat in the egg whites on high speed until combined, about 2 minutes. Then beat in the sour cream and vanilla extract. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed. With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients until just incorporated. With the mixer still running on low, slowly pour in the milk *just* until combined. Do not overmix. Whisk in 1/2 cup of room-temperature reduced strawberry puree, making sure there are no lumps at the bottom of the bowl. The batter will be slightly thick. Stir in food coloring, if desired. (I use 1 small drop of pink gel food coloring.)
Pour batter evenly into cake pans. Bake for around 24–25 minutes or until the cakes are baked through. To test for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, it is done. Allow cakes to cool completely in the pans set on a wire rack. The cakes must be completely cool before frosting and assembling.

**Frosting:**
- 1 cup (about 25g) freeze-dried strawberries
- 1 cup (16 Tbsp; 226g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
- 4 cups (480g) confectioners’ sugar
- 1/4 cup (60ml) heavy cream or whole milk, at room temperature
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- salt, to taste

**Instructions:**
Using a food processor or blender, process the freeze-dried strawberries into a powdery crumb. You should have around 1/2 cup. If it’s not grinding down fine enough, you can sift it with a fine mesh sieve to rid larger seeds/pieces. Set aside.
In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter on medium-high speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add confectioners’ sugar, strawberry powder, heavy cream/milk, and vanilla. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then switch to high speed and beat for 2 minutes. Taste. Add 1–2 more Tablespoons of heavy cream/milk if needed to thin out, if desired. (I usually add at least 1 more.) Add a pinch of salt if frosting is too sweet.",2025-04-16 02:36:09,6,ObsdianDrknssHelena,food

**Ingredients:**

  - 2 Tbsp vegetable oil, divided
  - 0.5kg sirloin steak, cut into strips
  - salt, to taste
  - black pepper, to taste
  - ½ red onion, sliced
  - 1 medium tomato, sliced
  -  1 red bell pepper, sliced 
  -  2 Jalapeños, seeds removed and sliced into long strips 
  - 2 cloves garlic, minced
  - 1 Tbsp aji amarillo paste
  - 2 Tbsp soy sauce
  - 1 Tbsp white vinegar
  - 1 Tbsp fresh cilantro, chopped
  - 0.5kg french fries, cooked, hot
  - white rice, cooked, for serving, optional

  
**Steps:**

1.  Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large pan over high heat. Add the steak, season with salt and pepper, and cook until browned, 5-6 minutes. Remove from the pan.

2.  Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in the same pan, then add the red onion and cook for about 5 minutes, until softened and browned. Add the red bell pepper and jalapeno and cook another 3-4 minutes. Add the tomato, garlic, and aji amarillo paste, and cook for another 5-7 minutes, until the tomatoes have released some of their juices, but are still intact.

3.  Add the soy sauce and vinegar and stir to combine, let cook for 1 minute.

4.  Add the steak, fries, and cilantro. Toss gently to coat the fries in the sauce.

5.  Serve with rice, if desired.

\* I use frozen fries, toss them in vegetable oil and cook in air fryer for convenience. Cook them longer than normal so they hold up longer in the sauce.

I always reserve some to serve on the side as well, for extra textural variation.",2025-04-10 10:42:11,8,Dangerous_Ad_7042,food
