1jmikp3,reddit,This Studio Ghibli AI trend is an utter insult to the studio and anime/cinema in general.,"What's up with these AI Ghibli pics recently? Wherever I go, I just cannot escape it. Being a guy who loves the cinematic art in any form, seeing this trend getting this scale of traction is simply sad. I have profound respect for the studio and I  was amazed by their work when I discovered movies like Castle in The Sky, Grave of the Fireflies, Spirited away, etc. And when I got to know how these movies are made and how much manual effort it takes to produce them, my appreciation only increased. But here comes some AI tool that can replicate this in a matter of minutes. This is no less than a slap on the faces of artists who spend hours imagining and creating something like this. 

I am not against AI, or advancements it is making. But there must be a limit to this. You can cut a fruit as well as stab someone with a kitchen knife. Right now, it is the latter happening with the use of AI tools just for cheap social media points. Sad state of affairs.

1jyt5nj,reddit,Hollywood Is Cranking Out Original Movies. Audiences Aren’t Showing Up.,"LOS ANGELES—When director Christopher Landon introduced his new thriller, “Drop,” before its premiere at the Chinese Theater on Hollywood’s Walk of Fame, he had a warning for the packed auditorium.

“It’s really hard out there for an original movie,” he said, urging everyone who liked the Universal Pictures release to “scream it from the rooftops” and on social media.

“Drop” opened this weekend to an estimated $7.5 million domestically, one of two new movies based on fresh ideas that fizzled at the box office. The other was Disney’s “The Amateur,” a spy thriller adapted from a little-known 1981 book, which opened to an estimated $15 million.

After years of gripes from average moviegoers and Hollywood insiders alike about the seemingly nonstop barrage of sequels, spin-offs, and adaptations of comic books and toys, the film industry placed more bets on original ideas.

The results have been ugly. 

Nearly every movie released by a major studio in the past year based on an original script or a little-known book has been a box-office disappointment. Before this weekend’s flops were Warner Bros. Discovery’s“Mickey 17” and “The Alto Knights,” Paramount’s “Novocaine,” Apple’s “Fly Me to the Moon,” Amazon’s “Red One,” and the independently financed “Horizon: An American Saga Chapter 1” and “Megalopolis.”

Jason Blum, who produced “Drop” and built his company Blumhouse largely on original horror franchises, said audiences’ preference for known properties has made it harder to release original movies in theaters, “even though that’s where some of the most exciting and risky storytelling still lives.”

Getting people into theaters more frequently is a priority for a movie industry still recovering from the pandemic. Box-office revenue in the first three months of this year in the U.S. and Canada was the lowest it has been, excluding the pandemic, since 1996.

At the CinemaCon industry convention in early April, theater owners said they welcome more original films, but only if they are backed by robust advertising campaigns. Building buzz for a new film in a media environment fractured between YouTube, TikTok, streaming and sports is tough, particularly when it is an unknown title.

“We’re opening films that have almost zero awareness,” said Bill Barstow, president of Main Street Theatres, a small Nebraska-based chain.

Many consumers are content to wait until an original motion picture is available to rent online a few weeks after its theatrical release or to stream on a service like Netflix in a few months.

The only films succeeding in the current environment are those with built-in audiences, like “A Minecraft Movie,” which was released in early April and has grossed more than $280 million domestically. And these days, even franchises can be far from a sure thing. Long-running series such as Marvel and DC superheroes and live-action remakes of Disney animated classics are showing their age and proving unreliable at the box office.

Studios say they have little choice but to make more original movies they hope will buck the odds.

“Telling original stories and taking risks is the only path toward creating new global franchises,” Bill Damaschke, Warner Bros.’ head of animation, said at CinemaCon.

Some of the increase in original film releases is attributable to Amazon and Apple, which are building film businesses with few well-established franchises. One of the biggest bets on an original film from any company this year is Apple’s “F1,” a June release starring Brad Pitt as a race-car driver.

Amazon hyped 11 coming movies to exhibitors at CinemaCon, of which six were originals. Among traditional studios, Warner Bros. is taking the most risks on originals, with big budget films from directors Paul Thomas Anderson and Maggie Gyllenhaal. 

Hollywood’s next original release comes Friday with Warner’s “Sinners,” a horror movie starring Michael B. Jordan. Next month even Marvel, home to Hollywood’s biggest franchises, is taking a gamble with “Thunderbolts,” about a super team brand new to all but the most devoted comic-book readers.",2025-04-14 07:31:41,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,8123,3781,,0.88,https://www.wsj.com/business/media/hollywood-is-cranking-out-original-movies-audiences-arent-showing-up-cfcf8d75?mod=hp_featst_pos5,OutrageousFootball10

1jwyr9i,reddit,Gladiator II made me finally understand the greatness and uniqueness of Russell Crowe's iconic performance.,"When i was a kid and watched Gladiator, i obviously thought Russell Crowe was great as Maximus, but in the following years i never necessarily understood why he won an Oscar for it.

It's not the typical role and performance for which you are considered worthy of an Oscar, it's not a baity biopic about a real-life famous and beloved figure or an arthouse challenging auteur-driven project, it's an heroic figure in a sandal and sword blockbuster.

What could be so great about this performance that you even win an Oscar for it??

I didn't get it until recently when i saw on theaters the awaited sequel.

Gladiator II and Paul Mescal's performance in it (and i really like him as an actor) made me revalue and understand how hard it is to play convincingly an heroic role like that and how easy and effortless Crowe made it look like.

It's an iconic performance that still resonates today, but not necessarily for reasons the general public thinks about.

He managed to do character-actor work, immersing himself into this character and creating a three-dimensional human being out of this two-dimensional role and also imbue it with huge and rugged movie star charisma and such fierce intensity.

With Crowe's presence, there's such depth and gravitas into a role that on paper could have easily ended up being so flat and dull in the hands of many and many other actors, even good ones.

He's stoic, but never dull or uninteresting, he's absolutely magnetic, always elevating every scene with a ferocious potency.

It's almost a throwback to those powerful, big, theatrical, and commanding performances you would see on those sword and sandal epics of the 40s-50s-60s, but updated, modernized, and made accessible for the audiences of the new millennium.

It's a hard feat he pulled off, much harder than many people think, it's simply not a performance you can just imitate and replicate, and watching recently Mescal trying to inhabit that same type of stoic character made me realize it much more.

Russell's performance wasn't just ""playing the hero"" or the good soldier, there was a personality and specific characterization you can't just copy, an entrancingly unique magnetism you can't just hope to recapture on film.

He's not just great, like i always thought, but quite frankly, no other actor in the world could have played Maximus and suddenly turn it into an Oscar winning role.

It's an unusual, unique, and absolutely deserved Oscar win, and a reminder of Crowe's unique talents and why he became a full fledged movie star after always having been a great actor.

I hope one day we will see him again in another role worthy of him and make a great comeback.

1k2d0zi,reddit,Grandma's Boy was way ahead of its time and doesn't get the credit it deserves,"It's a good solid comedy about a group of friends who work at a video game company in the mid 2000s. Waaay before nerd culture became popular and mainstream. It shows the lives of actual nerds before being a nerd became cool. Is it a cinematic masterpiece and the most well written comedy film ever? Of course not. Is it also a stoner movie? Yes. But it isn't a stoner movie in the way Half Baked or Harold and Kumar are stoner movies. And I think that aspect has always overshadowed the fact that it's just an overall good buddy comedy set in a time that is very nostalgic for a lot of people who were in the same age range as the characters at the time the movie was released. The reason I say it was ahead of its time is because you can swap out the video game company in Grandma's Boy with any creative media/internet/journalistic venture that groups of nerd friends have launched over the past 20 years, and it could serve as the exact same kind of backdrop for a similar story. And seeing how having such a venture is the norm these days in nerd culture, you can't deny seeing the makings of that kind of thing in the modern era of pop culture as early on as Grandma's Boy. Like I said, overall it's just a good comedy. But too often it gets dismissed as just being a typical stoner movie.

Edit: Nice to see all the love for Grandma's Boy. ",2025-04-18 19:12:26,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,4109,574,,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1k2d0zi/grandmas_boy_was_way_ahead_of_its_time_and_doesnt/,Imbetterthanthis1138

But, I'd run out of movies I'd wanted to watch, and I figured I'd give them a re-watch all these years later. Oh, boy, was I impressed. They were all truly a delight to watch from start to finish.

Fortunately, I'd forgotten most of what happens during the films. There are scenes and jokes that I remembered, but they were also fun to watch because they're performed so well. Absolute classics. Then, the rest, had me laughing on the inside and the outside.

1k32v08,reddit,I saw an image of Tim Curry on social media. Which has prompted me to make this post about Tim Curry...,"We all love Tim Curry... but I don't think we stop to appreciate just how amazing he really is. He's an actor, sure... but he can also sing. And sing well! He's willing to undergo makeup and prosthetics to transform himself into crazy characters. But he's also very open to various role offers; from The Hunt For Red October, to Home Alone 2: Lost In New York.


But on top of his amazing live action roles... he is a very prolific voice actor too! Ferngully, Scooby Doo, Wild Thornberrys... if you grew up in the 80s and 90s, dollars to donuts you know his voice! And if you grew up after the 80s and 90s... he has also narrated a few books on Audible. I personally own A Christmas Carol, read beautifully by the man himself!  

He's had a pretty diverse career in TV. Tim even made the venture into video games. Most infamously was Command & Conquer. I don't know much about his career on stage... but apparently he did that too! And two music videos! Thank you, Wikipedia! 


He's worked with Muppets, kids, and even Alec Baldwin! Just goes to show that he is patient and open minded as an actor. But, he's also a very kind person. Seldom will you ever hear anyone say anything but positive things about meeting Tim Curry. He is always very grateful for his career, and has so much time for his fans. 

He has suffered some health problems in recent years... and that sucks. But he hasn't given up! Tim Curry is a fighter and still has all his charm and quick wit that we've come to know him for throughout the years.

I personally will always remember him best from Legend, Muppet Treasure Island, and Home Alone 2... three movies from my childhood. If you line all three of his characters up side by side and told a random person in the street that it was all the same actor... they'd probably laugh in your face. Speaking of laughing... he apparently auditioned for The Joker before Mark Hamill got it. Would've loved to hear that take!


He is the reason so many people are afraid of clowns... but he is also the reason so many people fell in love with his films. 


Tim Curry.

1jvy3xi,reddit,Rewatched the Matrix sequels after 2 decades of recovering...,"Tried Reloaded and Revolutions again to see if they felt any different after all this time. My take:

\- Had the third film been good, Reloaded would have probably got a pass as a 'shaky' middle act in a great trilogy

\- Most of the bitter after taste comes from Revolutions

\- There were enough interesting ideas to have it be more than one great film, but the execution collapses

\- Neo and Trinity would be better as friends

\- Smith's character falls apart after the first film, he goes from delightfully cold and efficient, to gimmicky, then weirdly angry

\- Morpheus feels like a passenger with nothing to do, which was a critical mistake

\- We need to care about Zion, but there's no one there that we like. Morpheus could be there, but instead he's flying around on a ship for some reason

\- The architect scene made a surprising amount of sense, if your attention span is on

\- Rehashing the iconic lobby scene in Revolutions was baffling

\- The Zion council is unbearable and speak as if they have access to the film's script

\- The machines don't feel too threatening... they fly around in octopus swarms a lot

\- You could rewrite both Reloaded and Revolutions into great films if you took a different direction",2025-04-10 13:37:43,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,2165,684,,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jvy3xi/rewatched_the_matrix_sequels_after_2_decades_of/,Beneficial_Toe_2347

[Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/sinners-review-michael-b-jordan-ryan-coogler-1236363344/) (70):

>It's vibrant and richly acted, and also a wild throat-ripping blowout. But though overloaded at times, it's the rare mainstream horror film that's about something weighty and soulful: the wages of sin in Black America.

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/04/sinners-review-ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan-x-2-reteam-vampire-movie-1236365142/):

>*Sinners* marks another strong reason why Ryan Coogler is at the top of his generation of filmmakers, and Jordan continues to show why he is a real deal movie star.

[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/sinners-review-michael-b-jordan-ryan-coogler-horror-1236186742/) (90):

>The movie is smart horror, even poetic at times, with much to say about race and spiritual freedom. It’s not in the Jordan Peele league in terms of welding social commentary to bone-chilling fear. But *Sinners* is a unique experience, unlike anything either the director or Jordan has done before.

[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1831292/sinners-ryan-coogler-movie-review/) (9/10):

>""Sinners"" is several things at once — a monster movie, a blood-soaked action film, a sexy and sensual thriller, and a one-location horror flick as intense and paranoia-driven as anything from the original ""Assault on Precinct 13"" or Quentin Tarantino's filmography – but its greatest strength comes from how well Coogler blends every big idea on his mind.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/sinners-review-ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan-vampire-horror/) (88):

>“Sinners” is a bloody, brilliant motion picture. Ryan Coogler finds within the vampire genre an ethereal thematic throughline; and within the music genre a disturbing, tempting monster. Stunningly photographed, engrossing cinema — epic to the point where it seemingly never ends, which is undeniably indulgent, but no great sin. This is a film about indulgence, the power indulgence wields and the dangers indulgence invites into our lives. It’s a sweaty, intoxicating, all-nighter of a movie, and its allure cannot be denied.

[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/sinners-movie-2025-michael-b-jordan-cast-ryan-coogler-b2730833.html) (4/5):

>If cinema weren’t in such a sickly state, *Sinners*’s electric fusion of genres – historical epic, horror, and squelchy actioner – would be a guaranteed box office sensation. Instead, the film arrives with an uneasy sense that this is some kind of final stand for original ideas. One can only hope audiences recognise its bounty of riches.

[The Guardian](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/sinners/) (3/5):

>For many, the movie could as well do without the supernatural element, and I admit I’m one of them; I’d prefer to see a real story with real jeopardy work itself out. But there is energy and comic-book brashness

Vanity Fair (80):

> Sinners is propulsive and stirring entertainment, messy but always compelling. The film’s fascinating array of genres and tropes and ideas swirls together in a way that is, I suppose, singularly American.

[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/sinners-review-ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan-vampire-movie-1235114698/) (83):

>Sinners is nothing if not a film about genre, and the distinctly American imperative of cross-pollinating between them to create something that feels new and old — high and low — at the same time.

1jqil80,reddit,"What movies were saved by studio interference, that most people don't realize?","Hey there. So I have recently done a post in this subreddit asking about movies that were ruined by studio interference and meddling.
And I got a comment saying that the opposite isn't talked about enough.
It got me thinking what are some movies that were saved by studio interference/meddling.
The best examples I found of studio interference making a movie better were:
Predator (1987) The Studio insisted that the movie did not have enough gun fight scenes. As a result, McTiernan added the scene where the team looses it shoot their guns off into the jungle in every direction.

Apocalypse Now (1979) The studio insisted that Francis Ford Coppola, reduce the run time by an hour. So he edited out a number of scenes. If you have ever seen Redux you know how good of an idea it was.

The Warriors (1979): The studio made Walter Hill remove the comic book panels that he had originally put in the movie. The director’s cut reinstates the comic-book scenes that Hill wanted and they just don't work.

Alien (1979) The studio (producers Walter Hill and David Giler) added in the character of Ash, which original co-writer Dan O’Bannon felt was a completely unnecessary addition. If They Hadn’t Stepped In: We wouldn’t have had Ash, which means we potentially wouldn’t have had the whole Weyland-Yutari conspiracy plot.

So with these examples out of the way, does anyone have any other examples of movies being saved like this?",2025-04-03 13:34:17,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,2093,997,,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jqil80/what_movies_were_saved_by_studio_interference/,miguelrgabriel23

1jt84ve,reddit,The Gamble New Line Cinema made making the LORD OF THE RINGS Trilogy was INSANE,"Imagine being New Line founder & head honcho Bob Shaye. It’s circa 1998 & you’ve just been shown a presentation by a kiwi filmmaker most people have never heard of it. You’re shown costumes, weapons, cgi tests, miniatures, all funded by a rival studio that decided it can’t make this project because it’s just too expensive. So said Rival studio boss has given kiwi filmmaker a chance to pitch the project elsewhere. Every studio in town has turned the pitch down since there are some very large strings attached. Rival studio boss must be reimbursed for the millions in spent development costs, he must be given a % of the box office and you only have a 24 hours to decide. You were kiwi film makers last stop before heading back to New Zealand in defeat.

The kiwi filmmaker is pitching you a two film adaptation of perhaps the most well known book trilogies in existence. Your film company needs a hit, badly. After the presentation everyone looks to you for a reaction. “I don’t understand” you say. You see the faces of kiwi filmmaker and his team go white with dread before adding “it’s 3 books? It should be 3 movies”. 

And that’s it. That’s the start of one or the biggest most insane gambles in Hollywood history. The price tag? 270 million. That number will go up before all is said and done. 


Just think about it for a minute. New Line funded the production of 3 films shot back to back in a tiny country halfway around the world, by a director whose never had a hit movie, using unproven technology, with no A List star and if none of it works, the movie doesn’t succeed? You might lose your company. 

The production goes way over budget, loses a main actor after a few days of filming, New Line is constantly trying to mitigate its risk by cutting the runtime down, selling foreign distribution rights(boy will they come to regret that) 

The press is all over New Line. “This is insane”. “It’s going to fail”. “What are they going to do when it does fail” etc. But then…



May 2001 hits. Newline decides to preview 20 minutes of the first movie at the Cannes film festival. This is where everything changed. The public and press got its first real look at the film and the response is better than anyone could hope. New Line loosens up. Gives more money to finish the movie. There some actual buzz & hype now. 

But then 2 things happen. 


One is another highly anticipated book adaptation is coming out a month prior. Basically the hottest property on the planet not named Star Wars or Pokemon. “Harry Potter”. And when it does come out? It has the biggest opening weekend of all time. 

The other thing? Tragedy. 9/11. Do audiences even want to see a movie about wars and elves and hobbits? Will anyone care? 

Boy did they ever. December 2001 the gamble pays off. Whats more? They get 13! Academy Award nominations. It’s now officially a phenomenon.
 
And you’ve got 2 more movies to release. Each more successful than the last, an unheard or rarity for sequels of that era.",2025-04-07 00:00:23,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,1797,223,,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jt84ve/the_gamble_new_line_cinema_made_making_the_lord/,MrGittz

1k64fnp,reddit,"Fake (AI) Trailers are becoming a problem, in my opinion","Around Christmas time my mother was visiting my family and just casually we started talking upcoming movies. She then proceeded to get excited about the ""new"" twilight movie with all the original cast. She showed this trailer to my wife and myself and it was blatantly fake so we informed her. 
With that context in mind of both my wife and me being able to spot it, my wife today sent me a trailer for ""The Conjuring: Last Rites"" and she was convinced it was real. There are tell tell signs like clips from previous movies, completely unrelated movies such as ""The Woman in the Yard"" and most egregiously, shots of the cast, alone, just kinda motionless or the camera panning slowly. 

My main issue is the people posting these having no indication it's fake, or a concept trailer or anything, just very misleading. 

I don't necessarily have a problem with their existence, creative liberty and all that, and with AI it give people a chance to easily put ideas out there, however, is preface that fake trailers, regardless of intention, should give the watcher the knowledge, easily accessible, to know it is indeed not real.

1jtyamn,reddit,"April 4-6 Box Office Recap: 'A Minecraft Movie' massively over-performs, debuting with a colossal $162.7 million domestically. Worldwide, it earned $313.4 million, the second biggest debut for a video game movie.","https://preview.redd.it/3kitircrohte1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=92e79a33892ca9682412307a2d502234da9c8839

After some very weak months, the box office finally picked up steam with April.

And that's practically all because of ***A Minecraft Movie***, which overcame months of negative buzz to deliver a record opening weekend for a video game adaptation, as well as the biggest debut of the year.

The Top 10 earned a combined $190.8 million this weekend. That's up a massive 135.3% from last year, when ***Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire*** stayed on top, while ***Monkey Man*** and ***The First Omen*** underwhelmed.

Debuting atop, WB's ***A Minecraft Movie*** surpassed all expectations, earning a colossal $162.7 million in 4,263 theaters. That's even bigger than WB's ***Barbie*** ($162 million), and it's only behind ***Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2*** ($169 million) for the studio's biggest debut. The opening is also higher than the previous video game record, ***The Super Mario Bros. Movie*** ($146 million), although ***Mario*** debuted on a Wednesday and burned off demand.

Simply put, it's a fantastic film. Especially after months of negative buzz surrounding the film's trailers. And a much needed win for WB after a slate of disappointing performers like ***Joker***, ***War of the Rohirrim***, ***Companion*** and ***The Alto Knights***.

Back in September 2024, when the teaser trailer debuted, the film earned poor reception, with many criticizing the VFX. To win over audiences for the other trailers, studio marketing suits added more VFX and quelled rabid fans by conveying that their Minecraft will stay true to the game. But that's perhaps the key; people will talk badly about a product, but that buzz translates into awareness, which builds into curiosity.

Of course, not all negative buzz translates into curiosity (***Snow White*** waving in the distance). But the advantage for this film is simply ***Minecraft***. Despite the belief that the game lost relevance years ago, the stats say otherwise; ***Minecraft*** is the best-selling video game of all time, with over 300 million copies sold and nearly 170 million monthly active players as of 2024. Clearly, there's already an audience awaiting for a film, and they happily paid tickets for this. Even lukewarm reviews (48% on RT) didn't dissuade fans from checking it out.

According to Warner Bros., 67% of the audience was male, and 78% was under 25 years old. They gave it a middling ""B+"" on CinemaScore, which is very mediocre for a family film. While word of mouth among children is very positive, adults are less thrilled with the film. We'll see in subsequent weeks how much it drops, but for now, a $450 million domestic total is in the cards for ***A Minecraft Movie***.

Last week's champ ***A Working Man*** added $7.3 million this weekend. That's a 53% drop, which is slightly worse than ***Beekeeper***'s 48% drop. Of course, that film had incredibly weak competition, but it's a sign that the film might not be able to leg out as hoped. Through 10 days, the film has amassed $27.8 million, and it should finish with around $40 million domestically.

In third place, ***The Chosen: Last Supper — Part 2*** earned $6.9 million this weekend. That's down 42% from ***Part 1***'s performance last week. Let's see how ***Part 3*** fares this weekend.

With the arrival of a big blockbuster, ***Snow White*** had another terrible drop this weekend. It fell a rough 59%, earning just $5.9 million this weekend. The film's legs appear to be running out. Through 17 days, the film has earned a terrible $77.3 million and it's gonna finish with less than $90 million domestically. That's absolutely pathetic.

Blumhouse's ***The Woman in the Yard*** added $4.5 million this weekend. That's a 52% drop, which isn't that bad considering the film's poor word of mouth. Through 10 days, the film has earned $16.6 million, and it should pass $20 million by next week.

***Death of a Unicorn*** earned $2.6 million this weekend. That's a 53% drop, which is quite rough for a comedy. Through 10 days, the film has earned just $10.7 million and it will struggle to get to $15 million by the end of its run.

With the arrival of ***Part 2***, ***The Chosen: Last Supper — Part 1*** collapsed a horrible 84% this weekend, earning just $1.8 million. That took its domestic lifetime to $17.9 million after 10 days.

There was another wide release this weekend, Neon's ***Hell of a Summer***. Debuting in 1,255 theaters, it earned an okay $1.7 million. With weak word of mouth and horror/thriller competition on the way, it's gonna disappear quickly from theaters.

In ninth place, Bleecker Street's ***The Friend*** expanded to 1,237 theaters and earned $1.6 million this weekend.

Rounding up the Top 10 was ***Captain America: Brave New World***, which fell 54% and added $1.3 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $199 million and it will crack the $200 million milestone sometime this week.

#**OVERSEAS**

***A Minecraft Movie*** also took over the rest of the world. The film earned a huge $150.7 million overseas, for a $313.4 million worldwide debut. That's the second biggest debut for a video game movie, behind ***Mario***. The best debuts were in the UK ($19.9M), China ($14.5M), Mexico ($11.2M), Germany ($10.6M) and Australia ($8.3M). It still has other markets left, including Japan. We'll see if the film can be strong enough to hit the $1 billion mark.

***Snow White*** is running out of steam and it's already its third week. It added just $9 million overseas, which takes its worldwide total to a terrible $168.6 million.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

None.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

We're getting FOUR wide releases, and none stand a chance in dethroning ***Minecraft***.

The first is 20th Century Studios' ***The Amateur***, which stars Rami Malek as a CIA cryptographer who seeks revenge against his wife's killers. With ***A Working Man*** slowing down, this could be a main attraction for old-school action fans.

Another release is Universal/Blumhouse's ***Drop***, which stars Meghann Fahy as a widow who is contacted by a stranger to kill her date, or her family will be murdered. The film already premiered at SXSW and it has received strong reviews (89% on RT). Can it be the hit that Blumhouse wants and needs?

Another is A24's ***Warfare***, which follows in real-time a platoon of Navy SEALs on a mission through insurgent territory in 2006. It's directed by both Ray Mendoza and Alex Garland (although the latter states his role is more secondary), and it has earned great reviews so far (93% on RT). It's unreasonable to expect numbers similar to ***Civil War***, but perhaps it could be a surprise breakout for A24.

And finally, there's Angel Studios' ***The King of Kings***, an animated film about the life of Jesus Christ. Angel Studios has delivered a big marketing for the film, and pre-sales are reportedly strong here. Maybe it could surprise.

1jle7lo,reddit,My interpretation of the car accident in 'No Country for Old Men': Anton Chigurh is a dead man walking.,"There's a famous quote attributed to anthropologist Margaret Mead that the first sign of civilization in archaeology is a healed bone because anywhere else in the animal kingdom a broken bone is a death sentence and only humans working together had the ability to reset the bone and care for the individual while it healed.

We know that when Chigurh gets hurt he'll steal medical supplies and tend to himself. But a snapped arm bone can't really be treated like this and whatever he could do he'd still be left crippled to a point where he's unable to to do the only job he's capable of. Without going to a hospital he'd no longer useful to his employers.  

I don't know if any of this is a part of McArthur's intention. I've seen the interpretation that it's symbolic of the brutality inherent to the world that not even he can escape. But no one else in the story is so acutely vulnerable to this situation as he is; a man who is violently anti-social and entirely self-reliant presented with a situation that requires the willing help of others. And this vulnerability is highlighted by the lengths and pains he has to go to heal a much less serious wound. 

To put it in his terms: if he had been more like his victims, following the rules of society, then those rules would have in fact been of great use to him in that moment. And now it's his own rules that could be said to have ultimately failed him.

EDIT: I forgot to mention he’s a very distinct looking person, wanted for murder, on foot, walking away from a crime scene less than a mile away with a bone sticking out of his arm.",2025-03-27 21:25:53,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,1522,172,,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jle7lo/my_interpretation_of_the_car_accident_in_no/,porktorque44

On my first watch as a kid, I thought this was just a desperate plea. But rewatching as an adult, I realized Christof was actually telling the truth from his perspective. The real world Truman was escaping to in 1998 was already filled with reality TV, manufactured personas, and the early stages of our current parasocial nightmare.

Truman wasn't escaping artifice for reality - he was just trading one stage for a bigger, more complex one where he'd have the illusion of control.

This adds such a haunting layer to that final bow and ""In case I don't see ya - good afternoon, good evening, and good night."" It's not just a goodbye to his fictional world, but almost a greeting to ours.

>While many bad films are made with love, sequels, spinoffs and big-budget adaptations often make the artform feel inert because they are produced with so little heart that they might as well have been generated by AI. But here's the thing: I actually liked *A Minecraft Movie*. I'm as surprised as you are. This is not a disaster. Not by a mile. In fact, for most of its duration, it's downright charming and, in parts, had me laughing out loud.

>Watching “A Minecraft Movie,” we’re always aware that the story is something that’s been grafted onto the world, and that we don’t have much of a dramatic stake in it — that it’s just the film’s way of cobbling together something that “works.” (Which, in its way, is very Minecraft.) Some of this is amusing, but like the rest of “A Minecraft Movie” it never feels like it matters. Yet it’s no insult to say that, in this case, that’s actually true to the spirit of a video game that turns life into a blockhead version of itself.

[The Hollywood Reporter - Lovia Gyrakye](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/a-minecraft-movie-review-jason-momoa-jack-black-1236179043/)

>The most disappointing aspect of *A Minecraft Movie*, directed by the husband-wife duo who go by Jared Hess (*Napoleon Dynamite*, *Nacho Libre*), isn’t that it’s born out of an existing IP. We live in a world of low-effort reboots, unnecessary remakes and movies operating as extensions of corporate brands. Another one of these gluttonous projects is hardly surprising. What makes *A Minecraft Movie* so dispiriting is how it fails to spark the imagination, betraying a core tenet of the game on which it’s based. 

[The Wrap - Michael Ordona](https://www.thewrap.com/minecraft-movie-review-jason-momoa-jack-black/)

>The most accurate summation of “A Minecraft Movie” is probably “It is what it is.” It’s what it’s supposed to be. It probably won’t dig up many new converts to the game, but should strike box-office silver, at least. (And fans, be sure to stick around for two credits scenes – especially the second one.)

>It’s a real credit to Black’s irrepressibly unique comic energy that “A Minecraft Movie” never feels quite as hypocritical as it should. Either disastrously ill-suited for its message about how money is the enemy of joy, or immaculately *well*\-suited for its message about much harder it is to build things than it is to destroy them, Hess’ film can’t help but feel like its very existence is an affront to the creative freedom that has allowed “Minecraft” to become such a vital form of self-exploration for kids around the world (even Warner Bros.’ choice to call it “A Minecraft Movie\*”\* as opposed to “The Minecraft Movie” implies a spectrum of different concepts, despite the reality of a business that can only imagine this one). But Black — whatever his charms, and regardless of how well they’re deployed here — is a living testament to the idea that people can still thrive by staying true to their own expression. If not in this world, then perhaps in one of their own design.

>For a big-studio adaptation of a massively popular video-game, A Minecraft Movie lets a surprising amount of its director’s personality shine through. Napoleon Dynamite’s Jared Hess manages to fit some laugh-out-loud silliness into his Overworld saga before surrendering to the obligations of CG-driven fantasy adventure. Thematically, A Minecraft Movie offers a pat world-is-what-you-make-it lesson, but Jack Black and Jason Momoa in particular sell it with a lot of comic enthusiasm.

[AV Club - Jacob Oller](https://www.avclub.com/a-minecraft-movie-review)

>One could rightfully question pretty much all of *A Minecraft Movie*, a formulaic template ornamented with surrealism. Some moments bear the scribbled signature of a filmmaker with offbeat passions. These are quickly plastered over by the hotel artwork of a four-quadrant IP extravaganza—and even the by-the-numbers sequences seem jumbled, out of order, or repeated. Yet, there’s something fitting about this film’s contradictions. *Minecraft* is fertile ground for innovation and exploitation. It’s adaptable, limited mostly by those playing it. One can build something personal, copy something mass produced, or attempt to tweak one with the other. Those behind *A Minecraft Movie* saw infinite possibilities laid out before them and—unlike another adaptation of a popular building pastime, *The Lego Movie*—opted for the one that’s been made a thousand times before.

>Your noggin will certainly be done in by Steve and Garrett (Momoa) flying through the air in a risque position suggesting a sex act. Really, “A Minecraft Movie” a 101-minute lobotomy. Put that on the poster. For the uninitiated, the Overworld — I’m pretty sure — is a pixelated place where a player can erect buildings, create tools and design weapons out of blocks. The rules are unclear, as the filmmakers picked silliness over storytelling. Stacking cubes would not, at first glance, seem like a strong plot to hang an action-adventure film on, however “The Lego Movie” did so with cleverness, heart and humor. Trust me: “The Lego Movie” is “Lawrence of Arabia” next to “Minecraft.”

>There’s a world where “A Minecraft Movie” actually backs the idealism of creativity, which it so proudly boasts in its barebones story. Maybe if the film were animated, it could’ve played far better to the concept of endless possibilities and allowed for a far more visually dazzling spectacle. Inherently, maybe it would never even be possible, as the idea of creativity can only be celebrated as little as possible when it’s given the parameters of being in such a lazy ip scrape of the barrel as this. There used to be a time when a majority of children’s films were made with such care and intention. Now it seems all you need is buzzwords, celebrities, and “Avengers: Endgame” clap-inducing moments, all of which “A Minecraft Movie” has, unlike a soul, which at least the game feels like it possesses.

>So sloppy is *A Minecraft Movie* that it can’t keep track of its various concerns, highlighted by a mirthless subplot—in which Jennifer Coolidge’s vice principal picks up and woos an Overworld resident who’s traveled to our universe—that it basically drops around the midway point. Buried deep within Hess’ wannabe blockbuster is a message about how creativity is cool and, thus, so too are outcasts. Yet nothing about this hodgepodge fits together. *Minecraft* enthusiasts will be pleased by the film’s various nods to its multiplatform predecessor. Nonetheless, shouting out isn’t the same thing as faithfully celebrating and translating, and those with no experience assembling towers, villages, and weapons in Mojang Studios’ sandbox will undoubtedly find it all scattershot and wearisome.

1jxmkqd,reddit,Terminator 2 hits so much harder as an adult.,"I was born in 1993, my first time watching Terminator 2 was with my family (when age appropriate, probably 10 years old or so lol) in preparation for us going to the Universal Studios theme park where they had the Terminator 3-D experience (does that even exist anymore?). 

My brothers and I became obsessed and would literally put the DVD in just to watch the Minigun/Helicopter scene or the Motorcycle/Truck chase through the storm drains. 

Watched it with my wife last night, it’s probably been at least 15 years since I watched it front to back, I could still quote most lines but now that I’m an adult with a career, wife and pets that depend on me it felt completely different. 

The scene that hit me the hardest was Sarah Connor attacking Miles Dyson’s house. The man is brilliant, successful, has a beautiful house/family and is a part of a groundbreaking technology but also oblivious to the potential that this technology makes him “responsible for the death of 3 billion people” because it hasn’t happened yet. Why would he have thought of that? At the end he’s willing to sacrifice himself for the good of mankind. 

Skynet doesn’t even feel that farfetched at this point, in fact it’s probably going to be worse considering there’s no politics involved in the movie. 

I feel like my perspective on the movie completely changed from someone that idolized Arnold for being a badass to realizing how scary the reality is of the situation. 

All of this is not mentioning the acting, special effects cinematography and everything that helped make the movie such an incredible experience. I hate to say it but it’s as close to a perfect movie if I’ve ever seen one.

Some Reviews:

[IndieWire](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/226) \- [David Ehrlich](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/david-ehrlich) \- B-

>“Warfare” is a film that wants to be felt more than interpreted, but it doesn’t make any sense to me as an invitation — only as a warning created from the wounds of a memory. The film is a clear love letter to Elliot Miller and the other men in Mendoza’s unit, but the verisimilitude with which it recreates the worst day of their lives — when measured against the ambiguity as to what it hopes to achieve by doing so — ultimately makes “Warfare” seem like a natural evolution of Garland’s previous work, so much of which has hinged on the belief that our history as a species (and, more recently, America’s self-image as a country) is shaped by the limits of our imagination. 

[San Francisco Chronicle](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/402) \- [G. Allen Johnson](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/g-allen-johnson) \- 4/4

>Garland has become this generation’s Oliver Stone, a studio filmmaker who is able to fearlessly capture the zeitgeist on hot-button issues few other Hollywood filmmakers touch, such as AI (2015’s “Ex Machina”), the political divide and a society’s slide toward violence (“Civil War”), and now the consequences of military diplomacy.

[Empire Magazine](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/148) \- [Alex Godfrey](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/alex-godfrey) \- 5/5

>War is hell, and Warfare refuses to shy away from it. Free of the operatics of most supposed anti-war films, it’s all the more effective for its simplicity. It is respectfully gruelling.

[The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/213) \- [David Rooney](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/david-rooney)

>Garland is working in peak form and with dazzling technical command in what’s arguably his best film since his debut, *Ex Machina*. But the director’s skill with the compressed narrative would be nothing without the rigorous sense of authenticity and first-hand tactical knowledge that Mendoza brings to the material — and no doubt to the commitment of the actors.

[AV Club](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/833) \- [Brianna Zigler](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/brianna-zigler) \- B+

>Simply depicting the plain, ugly truth of human combat makes *Warfare* all the more effective as a piece of art setting out to evoke a time and place. The bombing set piece is equal parts horrific and thrilling; the filmmakers draw out the sensory reality of the slaughter as the men slowly come to, disoriented, ears ringing, ultimately leading to a frenzy of confusion, agita, and howling agony. The cacophony of torment and its reaction in the men meant to arrive with help is as grim as the bureaucratic resistance to send in medic vehicles to give the wounded any chance to survive their injuries.

[Independent (UK)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/691) \- [Clarisse Loughrey](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/clarisse-loughrey) \- 3/5

>Alex Garland has now constructed what could be called his trilogy of violence... Warfare, at least, is the most successful of the three, because its myopia is a crucial part of its structure. Garland and Mendoza do, at least in this instance, make careful, considerate use of the film’s framework. We’re shown how US soldiers invade the home of an Iraqi family who, for the rest of *Warfare*’s duration, are held hostage in a downstairs bedroom, guns routinely thrust into their faces. In its final scene, they reemerge into the rubble of what was once their home, their lives upended by US forces and then abandoned without a second thought. It’s quite the metaphor.

[Daily Telegraph (UK)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/921) \- [Robbie Collin](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/robbie-collin) \- 5/5

>It’s necessarily less sweeping than Garland’s recent Civil War, and for all its fire and fury plays as something of a philosophical B-side to that bigger earlier film. I’d certainly be uncomfortable calling it an action movie, even though vast tracts of it are nothing but. It leaves questions ringing in your ears as well as gunfire.

[Guardian](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/205) \- [Peter Bradshaw](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/peter-bradshaw) \- 3/5

>In some ways, Warfare is like the rash of war-on-terror pictures that appeared 20 years ago, such as Kathryn Bigelow’s The Hurt Locker or Nick Broomfield’s Battle for Haditha, or indeed Brian De Palma’s interesting, underrated film Redacted. But Warfare doesn’t have the anti-war reflex and is almost fierce in its indifference to political or historical context, the resource that should be more readily available two decades on. The movie is its own show of force in some ways, surely accurate in showing what the soldiers did, moment by moment, though blandly unaware of a point or a meaning beyond the horror.

[Times (UK)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/823) \- [Kevin Maher](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/kevin-maher) \- 5/5

>This is a movie that’s as difficult to watch as it is to forget. It’s a sensory blitz, a percussive nightmare and a relentless assault on the soul.

[Deadline](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/2256) \- [Gregory Nussen](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/gregory-nussen)

>While it aims for an unromantic portrait of combat, it can only conceive of doing so through haptic recreation in lieu of actual characterization. The result is a cacophonous temper tantrum, a vacuous and perfidious advertisement for military recruitment.

[London Evening Standard](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/source/446) \- [Martin Robinson](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critics/martin-robinson) \- 4/5

>Given all the America First stuff going on, and the history of the Iraq War, Warfare may suffer from a lack of sympathy for American military operations.

Just finished my A24 weekend marathon (wrapped up with Everything Everywhere All At Once, Talk to Me, and Civil War) and I'm struck again by how consistently this studio has managed to dominate cultural conversations around film for the past decade.

What started as an indie darling has become a full-on cultural phenomenon - to the point where ""it's an A24 film"" has become shorthand for a certain aesthetic and quality expectation. They've somehow managed to bridge the gap between critical acclaim and cult following in a way that feels unique in today's fragmented media landscape.

Their formula seems deceptively simple: find distinctive directorial voices, give them creative freedom, market the films with striking visuals and minimal exposition, and let word-of-mouth do the rest. But the consistency is remarkable.

What I find most interesting is how they've become a trusted brand for younger audiences who might otherwise be disengaged from non-franchise cinema. The way their films spread through TikTok and social media feels different from traditional film marketing.

Do you think any other studio has matched their cultural impact in recent years? ",2025-04-22 11:53:30,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,1118,239,,0.85,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1k54e5s/a24ification/,Bluntfeedback

1k37f8i,reddit,Does it bother people when time limits given in movies are not followed?,"I've just watched San Andreas, which is a fun but unsurprisingly unrealistic movie, but one thing that's stood out to me as particularly immersion breaking is the use of time. It's just arbitrary.

For example, at the start of the film there's a scene where a rescue helicopter is running low on fuel whilst hovering during a rescue.

The Rock (I don't even think the character has a name, it's always just The Rock playing himself) says ""we have 5 minutes!"". 

About 15 minutes later and the helicopter is still going. And then they finally rescue the girl and fly back to base, the lack of fuel completely ignored for the rest of the flight.

The scene already had plenty of jeopardy, why add low fuel as well if it's going to be ignored immediately?! 

And then later, The Rock is saving his daughter from drowning whilst appearing to hold his breath for 30mins all while doing intense physical exertion. 

Bonus points for him watching her drown before deciding to try kicking the blockage to free her...

Do these silly time related discrepancies annoy anyone else more than they should?

Incredible film, acting and music. The pacing is great, and keeps your adrenaline up. The way they explained technical terms and concepts was great for someone that has basic knowledge of the stock market. I did have to go back a few times to rewatch some parts. 

Not being an American citizen, it was shocking to see the reality of what a mess the banks made of the mortgage market. My face must’ve looked more shocked than Steve Carell’s character throughout the movie. The greed and apathy of the top guys is incredible. I especially liked the Mr. Chau character (who is a real person). And the gotcha at the end when they revealed only 1 person got a prison sentence out of this shit show. 

The parallels with what’s going on right now is quite freaky. My favourite part was how they blamed immigrants and the poor. They’re still blaming immigrants and the poor.

With Booker (Matthias Schoenaerts) still in exile after his betrayal, and Quynh (Veronica Ngô) out for revenge after escaping her underwater prison, Andy grapples with her newfound mortality as a mysterious threat emerges that could jeopardize everything she’s worked towards for thousands of years. Andy, Nile (KiKi Layne), Joe (Marwan Kenzari), Nicky (Luca Marinelli) and James Copley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) enlist the help of Tuah (Henry Golding), an old friend who may provide the key to unlocking the mystery behind immortal existence. Directed by Victoria Mahoney, and also starring Uma Thurman, The Old Guard 2 is an emotional, adrenaline-pumping sequel, based on the world created by Greg Rucka and illustrator Leandro Fernandez.

1jo3nv7,reddit,Inglourious Basterds Ending,"Just finished watching and I’ve seen a lot of people say Hans’ betrayal didn’t make sense but to me this ending was practically perfect.

In the first scene Hans harps on the importance of perception. The difference in treatment between rodents (rats and squirrels), and he also revels in the nickname awarded to him by the french (the jew hunter).

He also describes his ability to think like two different beasts, the hawk and the rat, which make him perfect for his role. For most of the film, he is positioned as a hawk as it’s beneficial but by the end we see his ability to align his identity with that of the rat to carve his name on the right side of history.

I also noticed the constant readjustment of his badges throughout the film which I attributed to his receptivity to public opinion and general desire for respect. It makes why he’d prefer to be seen as a double agent rather than a soldier turned halfway through the war.

1js2mnh,reddit,What non-horror movie did you find most disturbing?,"I saw the Ballad of Buster Scruggs weeks ago and still can't get it out of my head. It was marketed as a comedy, so I wasn't prepared for how sad and serious some of the stories would be. I had an uneasy, anxious feeling while watching, uncomfortable with the un romanticized nature of the stories. The gold prospector story was nice but still disturbing to see calloused competition and cruelty.

I watch horror movies and usually don't feel disturbed so it's been puzzling trying to pin down why Buster Scruggs got to me.

You just know that things like that did happen during those times and while they happen today too, what disturbs me is that back then it was much more common and normal for tragedies to occur, and there was much less opportunity for accountability and awareness of the true events.

It disturbs me to think that people in the film had a limited ethical and moral compass not because they were evil outliers but simply because they were limited by the era and conditions they were born into. I don't like thinking of this powerlessness.

While watching I felt like I was grieving for my ancestors for what their ""normal"" was, how harsh those times were, and frankly amazed my ancestors survived things like that. It made me feel grateful to be living in modern times, especially with technology.

1jpny7s,reddit,The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is an absolute delight.,"I rewatched this movie for the first time in a while yesterday and was reminded of how much damn fun this movie is. Each part of the anthology has something else going on it, and carries the energy through, which is hard to do in a collection type work like this.



Anthology pieces invite comparison, and I think the short pieces collected here work well together.



Standout moments for me:


1. Steven Root chasing James Franco down in a homemade suit of armor as Franco tries to shoot him. ""PAN SHOT.""


2. Everything in Meal Ticket. Neeson plays such a convincing sleazebag. This one packs a punch.



3. Tom Waits in the one about the prospector hunting for gold. The land itself is a character here. I could watch him work in the wilderness all day.



4. Every. Dang. Second. of the Oregon Trail love tragedy. The stuff about her brother's dog, named President Pierce, holds a special spot in my heart. ""President Pierce is a nervous creature, and excited by animals larger than himself."" ""Almost all animals are larger than President Pierce.""



5. The last sketch is the only one that doesn't pack quite a punch, and whose ending is telegraphed early on, but watching Tyne Daly and Brendan Gleeson play off one another in the coach is pretty great.

1jmurh9,reddit,BASEketball: Squeak is the MVP,"The first scene of pro Baseketball, we see Coop blow the Denslow Cup. He gets psyched out so bad that he falls forward, and barely makes it in the direction of the rim. Squeak made his shot right before to bring Coop to the plate with a chance to walk off Denslow Cup 4. 

Squeak gets roasted nonstop the entire movie. He cannot be psyched out. He gets more fucked up shit said to him than anyone by far. He lives and plays with the best psych-out artists in the league. On the surface he seems like a nervous wreck, but he's the most clutch shooter on the team. He also psychs out Tuttle to beat the LA Riots to clinch a playoff spot.

Squeak always protects Joey's heroic image of Coop, even though Coop is a complete asshole to him. It's all about the kid. He tells Joey that Coop is a major dude, while not pursuing the girl at the bar. Coop falls asleep at the plate, throws the 3rd homerun over the garage, and almost kills Joey at the hospital. Before that, Coop and Remer spend Joey's whole day with the team fighting over Jenna. 

Squeak is a leader. With Denslow Cup 5 slipping away and the team getting blown out, It is Squeak who rallies the team on the Mulakalaka balance board of trust, while dressed as a pineapple. Remer doesn't even try, while Coop merely sucks until then. Once again, Squeak never misses. In fact, the only shot Squeak misses the entire movie is when he's not even playing, and doesn't know the rules yet.

Squeak puts himself in scoring position in the Denslow Cup 5 game so many times, he collapses from running the bases. He then scores the tying run on the game winning shot. Only then, with the championship won, does Squeak engage with the girl from the bar.

Coop is overwhelmed and out of his element as the player/owner. He gets distracted with the ownership of the team on the line by chasing Jenna instead of maintaining the Beers franchise and trying to make the playoffs. He flies to Calcutta to deal with his clothing line scandal and barely makes it back in time for the big game.

Remer is the team cancer. When he doesn't get his way, he pouts. He cares way more about money and status than winning. He actively colludes with the Dallas owner to begin turning the league into everything it was meant not to be. He basically gives up on the team on anal-probe night, dragging the rest of the team down. Only Squeak isn't pissed off about not controlling the team they aren't the owner of.

Wind River is one that comes to mind, but there was a bit of levity in it with how good the chemistry between Olsen and Renner was. I prefer something that really doesn’t let up and wants you to feel as miserable and scared as the characters do.

1k5fed2,reddit,Movies you loved as a kid & adult only to discover the movie had a negative reputation with critics & audiences. For me it’s got to be “Ghostbusters 2”,"I grew up loving Ghostbusters. The movies, the cartoons, and the toys.

But as I got older I started realizing more and more that “Ghostbusters 2” had a less than stellar reputation. That shocked me. I mean is it as good as the first? No. But it’s still a damn good time. It’s got a great plot device(negative charged slime), a scary bad guy(VIGO!), some fun set pieces(court room bust) but most all?
You get to spend time with these actors playing these characters. They have this wonderful chemistry together. 

They have such great chemistry. I remember coming across the IMDb score for the 2nd Ghostbusters. Back then it was much lower than it is now. In the 5/10 range. What gives?

I watched Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel, fans of the first film, rip the sequel to shreds. 

I would read how critics and audiences thought it’s a retread of the first film, it wasn’t funny, didn’t make sense. “Why are people still not believing in ghosts after the first film”. That last one never made sense to me. In the entire film only like 3 people say they don’t believe. One or which is an insane judge. Another a kid I mean…it’s 2025 and people still think we didn’t go to the moon or that the earth is flat. So I don’t think everyone would be accepting to the idea of ghosts and marshmallow men.

1k19giz,reddit,"Wasn't the biggest fan of The Whale, but I'm shocked at the number of people who don't seem to understand Charlie's character at all","So many people hate him because they say it was selfish for him to eat himself to death with his daughter back in his life, and if he really loved her, he would try to get better.

But the point of the movie isn't to be some big redemption story for Charlie.  He binge eats because he's essentially given up on himself due to a combination of guilt and self loathing.  He abandoned his family and failed his lover.  Every day he's alive reminds him of what a piece of shit he feels he is.  When you're that deep in the hole, it's not so easy to just pick yourself up and try to get better.  You don't feel like you deserve it.  In his mind, he deserves to die, and the only thing about him that's worth giving to his daughter is his money.

So he saves money for his daughter as a way for him to justify his continued existence, and he doesn't really believe he deserves to be part of her life, so he keeps his distance.

When he finally does contact her, I don't think it's really a rational decision.  He still feels like he doesn't deserve to be in her life, but he knows he's dying, and he can't stomach the idea of leaving the world without having some kind of relationship with her, so he ends up kind of sheepishly trying to re-insert himself into her life to some degree.  I don't think he ever tries to squeeze forgiveness out of her.  He just doesn't want to go to his grave knowing she hates him and that he didn't try to do something right for her before the end.

It's a lot of conflicting emotions and decision-making from a highly flawed human being who doesn't really want to live anymore, but is still trying to ""something"" right with the time he's got left.  Him giving his daughter the money doesn't make up for what he took from her, and that's not really what he's trying to do anyway.  It's all he's really capable of giving her at this point, and he doesn't want to die knowing he did nothing for her at all.

People saying that he should've just stopped eating clearly don't understand why he's eating.  It's not because he loves food.  It's because he hates himself.  He doesn't feel like he deserves to live, but he's also still afraid of death.  The base human instinct to continue living is extremely strong.  Anyone who's been severely depressed and suicidal but still can't stop themselves for going about their daily routine can tell you that.  So he eats to numb the pain, and once he realizes it's killing him, he sees it as a just punishment for his failings as a person and allows it to continue happening.

I can understand not empathizing that much with Charlie to some degree, but the people who see his refusal to get well as actively malicious and selfish on his part don't really understand what it's like to be truly depressed to that degree.  You might as well be telling a suicidal person to just ""suck it up"" or a depressed person to just ""stop being depressed"".  When you're that deep in the hole, it's nearly impossible to pull yourself out because you've already resigned yourself to death and also to the idea that you're not worth saving, and everyone would be better off with you gone.

Same thing with him hiding his money from the caretaker.  He wasn't consciously doing it to make her life harder.  He was doing it because he felt he didn't deserve to get better, and he knew if he'd told her, she wouldn't have understood because who would willingly watch someone kill themselves like that.

I think it was realistic how frustrated people became with him, but also a little grating at times that no one seemed to be able to comprehend why a mentally ill person would make irrational, self destructive decisions.

He's not a hero, and he's not a villain.  He's a guy who made an incredibly selfish, impulsive decision, caused a lot of suffering as a result, and then paid for it with his happiness and his life.  When we meet him, that person is long dead, and he's a shell of the man who did those things.  I don't think the film is trying to absolve Charlie of his past wrongdoings.  It's just painting a picture of an unfortunate situation that people often find themselves in in the real world.  There aren't always happy endings or meaningful lessons to learn.",2025-04-17 10:27:42,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,744,79,,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1k19giz/wasnt_the_biggest_fan_of_the_whale_but_im_shocked/,moal09

1k4o61c,reddit,"April 18-20 Box Office Recap: 'Sinners' opens with a fantastic $48 million domestically, making it the best opening for a live-action original film in years. Meanwhile, 'A Minecraft Movie' crosses $700 million worldwide.","https://preview.redd.it/ve54b1yp29we1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=d66d93333fd7c823d8b731a79eebfac3bfbba7ad

On Easter weekend, audiences decided to go watch ***Sinners***. The result? A #1 debut, and the biggest debut for an original film in the post-COVID era. While ***A Minecraft Movie*** had to cede the top spot, it's already over $700 million worldwide.

The Top 10 earned a combined $127.9 million this weekend. That's up a massive 109.7% from last year, when ***Civil War*** held the top spot from disappointing newcomers like ***Abigail*** and ***The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare***.

Debuting atop, Ryan Coogler's ***Sinners*** earned a fantastic $48 million in 3,308 theaters. This is the best debut for Coogler's career outside the ***Black Panther*** films. In fact, it's the biggest debut for a live-action original film in the post-COVID climate, opening above ***Nope*** ($44.3 million).

Simply put, it's a fantastic start. Take into account, getting an original film to open this high is a miracle, given that audiences are pivoting to focusing on franchises. It's a testament to the strength of Ryan Coogler and Michael B. Jordan. So how they did succeed where other original films failed?

For the past decade, Coogler has earned some great good will, thanks to his works in films like ***Creed*** and ***Black Panther***. The films have earned fantastic reception, allowing him to finally get an original title like ***Sinners*** to get greenlit. It wasn't easy, obviously; a big reason why some studios turned it down was Coogler's request to have the film rights revert to him after 25 years. So Warner Bros. took the bullet and agreed to his terms, [a decision that apparently scared a lot of Hollywood executives.](https://www.vulture.com/article/to-hollywood-the-scariest-part-of-sinners-is-ryan-coogler.html)

The film's clear selling point was Coogler and Jordan, but the premise was also very important: a 1930s horror film, with Jordan playing twins. 2025 has been very weak for horror; the biggest horror film is ***The Monkey***, which hasn't even topped $70 million worldwide. The audience was starving for a horror film and ***Sinners*** arrived at the right time to offer just that. The film's fantastic reviews cannot be ignored either; it's sitting at a marvelous 98% on Rotten Tomatoes and 84/100 on Metacritic. That makes it one of the best films of the year, so even non-horror fans wanted to see if the film would live up to the hype.

According to Warner Bros., the biggest demos were black (49%), Caucasians (27%), Hispanic and Latino (14%), and Asian (6%). They gave it an incredible ""A"" on CinemaScore. This makes it one of the few horror films to get an ""A"" on the site (***Poltergeist*** and ***Aliens*** are the other two) in its 46-year-old history. Yes, it's insanely hard for a horror film to get this grade.

What does this mean? That the film is gonna have some damn great legs. It's already seen in the weekend; horror films can drop over 40% on Sunday, yet ***Sinners*** dropped just 25%. With no horror competition till ***Final Destination: Bloodlines***, ***Sinners*** can have a lot of space. For now, we're predicting a $170 million domestic total for the film, which is simply fantastic all around.

***A Minecraft Movie*** dropped 48% this weekend, grossing $40.4 million. That's not a bad drop, but it's still rough just like last week's. The film is not collapsing, but it's not showing great legs either. The film has amassed $343.8 million so far, and it should still hit over $450 million domestically. 

Unsurprisingly, ***The King of Kings*** benefitted from the Easter weekend. It dipped just 9%, earning $17.5 million this weekend. That's one of the best holds for a film playing at over 3,000 theaters. Through 10 days, the film has earned $45.6 million, although with the holiday over, maybe it will have a steep drop next weekend.

20th Century Studios' ***The Amateur*** was hit by the arrival of ***Sinners***. It dropped a rough 53%, earning $7 million this weekend. While the film was aiming an old audience that doesn't go to opening weekend, it looks like the film is struggling to leg out. Through 10 days, the film has earned a weak $27.1 million, and it remains a question mark if it will hit $40 million domestically.

In fifth place, A24's ***Warfare*** dipped 42%, adding $4.8 million this weekend. Through 10 days, the film has earned $17.1 million, and it will probably end its run with around $25 million domestically.

Universal/Blumhouse's ***Drop*** added $3.2 million this weekend, which is a poor 55% drop after its already low start. Despite positive reviews and word of mouth, the audience doesn't appear to be interested in the film. Through 10 days, it has earned just $13.4 million, and it's now guaranteed to miss $20 million domestically, making it one of Blumhouse's lowest grossing titles.

***COLORFUL STAGE! The Movie: A Miku Who Can’t Sing*** managed to sneak into the seventh spot, despite playing in just 800 theaters, earning $2.8 million this weekend.

Focus Features' re-release of ***Pride & Prejudice*** earned $2.8 million in 1,393 theaters. That takes its lifetime total to $41.3 million.

***The Chosen: Last Supper — Part 3*** collapsed 75% this weekend, earning just $1.5 million this weekend. Through all 3 installments, the show has made $42.9 million so far.

Rounding up the Top 10 was Disney's ***Snow White***, which is nearing the end of its run. It had another brutal 58% drop, earning just $1.2 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at a poor $84.6 million so far.

Bleecker Street released ***The Wedding Banquet*** in 1,142 theaters, although the film earned just $922,906. That means that the film is gonna make less than what Ang Lee's original made back in 1993 ($6.9 million).

But the real worst performer of the week was Briarcliff's animated film ***Sneaks***. Despite playing in 1,500 theaters, the film earned an abysmal $530,786 this weekend. That's one of the worst debuts for a film playing in over 1,000 theaters. Expect this to fade quickly.

Ahead of its wide release this week, A24's ***The Legend of Ochi*** debuted in 4 theaters, earning $52,514. That's a $13,129 per-theater average, which is quite low (usually buzzy titles like this make $25K or more). Let's just hope it can do better when it hits wide release.

Janus Films also released David Cronenberg's ***The Shrouds*** in 3 theaters, where the film earned $49,361. Alos a low $16,454 per-theater average. It will continue expanding in the coming weeks.

#**OVERSEAS**

***A Minecraft Movie*** earned $59 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $720 million. The best markets are the UK ($59.2M), Germany ($27.8M), Australia ($27.4M), Mexico ($24.8M) and China ($24M). The billion mark is becoming more and more likely, pals.

***Sinners*** earned $15.4 million in 71 markets, taking its worldwide numbers to $63.5 million. The best debuts were in the UK ($3.2M), France ($2M), Mexico ($1.1M), Germany ($898K) and Australia ($842K). An okay start, but it's pretty clear it's gonna lean heavily on the domestic side.

***The Amateur*** added a further $11.6 million this weekend, for a $63.8 million worldwide total. The best markets are the UK ($4.1M), France ($3.3M), Mexico ($3.2M), Japan ($2.3M) and Spain ($2M). At the very least, it should hit $100 million worldwide. That'd be great if it didn't cost $60 million.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Dog Man* | Jan/31 | Universal | $36,001,940 | $97,970,355 | $140,534,355 | $40M

- DreamWorks' ***Dog Man*** has ended its run with $97 million domestically and $140 million worldwide. Definitely a success, given it cost just $40 million. But something weird about the film are its legs. Normally, animated films leg out to a 3x multiplier. But ***Dog Man*** finished with just a 2.72x multiplier, making it one of the most front-loaded animated films. While the Super Bowl impacted its second weekend, not hitting the $100 million milestone after its debut is kinda disappointing. But then again, this should be enough if DreamWorks wants a new franchise.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

We've got three wide releases, though it's unlikely any of them can take the top spot.

The closest that could challenge the top spot is Amazon MGM's ***The Accountant 2***, which brings back Ben Affleck, Jon Bernthal, Cynthia Addai-Robinson, and J. K. Simmons in their roles. The original film earned $155 million worldwide, and has been a huge success in streaming and home media, so a sequel was pretty much imminent. Although the 9-year gap raises concerns that they might have waited too long.

Another release is Sony's ***Until Dawn***, an adaptation of the video game. Director David F. Sandberg has had success in the horror field, and in fairness, the movie tries to change things up from the game. Nevertheless, the film's premise (a time loop involving different killers) suggests it pretty much abandoned the game's original plot. It remains to be seen if the fans will be willing to buy a ticket.

And as mentioned, A24's ***The Legend of Ochi*** is hitting wide release. The limited release numbers were quite underwhelming, but perhaps it could surprise when it hits wide release.

1juswsc,reddit,The T-Rex in Jurassic Park is the Greatest Special Effect Ever - And I'm not Talking About the CGI One,"So, *Jurassic Park* is a very important movie to me. I'm in my early thirties, and I've grown up watching this movie, as well as it's first two sequels (I'm admittedly not a fan of the *World* sequels). I've seen it more than any other movie by far, and it never ceases to amaze me. When I was a kid in the 90's, entering the Jurassic Park section at Universal Studios in Florida was a magical experience as they perfectly re-captured the feeling of entering the park from the movie. The music still gives me goosebumps every time I hear it. My favorite dinosaur? It's got to be the T-Rex. And I truly believe it's the greatest special effect that was ever in a movie, or ever will be. And I'm not talking about the CGI one - despite being a ground breaking achievement, it doesn't hold a candle to the life sized animatronic Stan Winston Studios created for the movie.

Unfortunately, over the years, I feel like the life sized animatronic T-Rex has been overshadowed by the CGI one. Sure, it a huge step in a totally new form of digital effects. And sure, 30 years later and it still manages to hold up due to Spielberg's restraint and cleaver usage of the medium. But having an actual 30 foot tall [T-Rex sized robot that looks and moves as realistic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFTsYGgdR9k&t=59s) as it did is just jaw dropping. I'm currently watching the Industrial Light & Magic docuseries on Disney+ and they, along with everyone else in other similar videos discussing the cultural impact of the film, always highlight the CGI effects and don't seem to spend as much time discussing how incredible the practical effects were. 

During quarantine, I was lucky enough to interview Stan Winston's son Matthew Winston regarding his father's legacy. He told me how he was present on set for multiple movies his father worked on, and got to be up close and personal with Aliens, Predators, Terminators, Pumpkinheads and everything in between, but nothing was as incredible and surrealistic as seeing the T-Rex in all it's glory. I could only imagine how mystifying that would have been.

They went even bigger with *The Lost World* by having two T-Rexes. Say what you will about that movie, but they absolutely devoured every scene they were in (sharing a bite with each other is one of the coolest deaths in the series). While the third movie continued the practical dinos, the modern trilogy either seemed to lean fully into CGI (which is already dated) or used practical effects that were somehow less effective than ones used decades prior. 

How do you feel about the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park? Have they left a huge impression on you? Do you think any special effect has come close? I personally think Gollum in LOTR would be the most noteworthy, and I also think the practical effects, costumes, set design, etc in that trilogy is phenomenal as well.

1jmhcmi,reddit,The World's End became way more relevant than I initially gave it credit for,"This movie came out over 10 years ago; I don't think I have to litigate its quality to anyone here. 

I originally saw this movie in 2014, a couple years after it released. I figured, it's no match for Shaun of the Dead, which I grew up watching from when I was 10, and not as clever as Hot Fuzz. It was just a lukewarm movie that I got a handful of laughs out of. 

It wasn't until I entered adulthood that I realized how much this movie spoke to who I am as a person. It laid bare my inadequacies far clearer than any media I have ever viewed.

I think the vast majority of viewers see Gary King as a pitiful character. Some may have even known someone like him. 

One thing that has always struck me about this movie in later years is that it felt like it was talking directly to me in its plot points and characters.

Gary King is not just a fictional character. He's me. I've never felt more affinity for a fictional character than hearing Gary's monologue towards the end of the film. 

""That was supposed to be the beginning of my life. All that promise and fucking optimism. It was a big lie. Nothing happened.""

Fuck, man. I watched this shit for the first time when I was a sophomore in high school, out of obligation for Shaun and Fuzz at the time. I had no idea it would go on to describe an essential part of who I was for 10 years. 

I like to think that most people empathize with Gary here, but some of us really are that fucking pathetic to hold on to our ""glory days"" all these years later. For some of us, it really was all we ever had.

It never got better than that night.",2025-03-29 07:52:17,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,708,80,,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jmhcmi/the_worlds_end_became_way_more_relevant_than_i/,Danielnrg

1jxomw0,reddit,We need more movies like Dungeons and Dragons. Especially in this era.,"I recently rewatched the movie, put it on as background noise, but found myself looking at it critically. I realized just how good of a movie it is and not just based off being a fan of DND. There’s so much to like about this movie even if you don’t like or care about DND.

The dialogue is tight. The plot is simple, but endearing. Characters are defined quickly and are all played really well. You can feel the sincerity and fun they had being these characters and being in the movie. 

With Snow White being all over with comments from the actress disparaging romance in movies. I like how the movie counters the romantic plot being needed without having to call attention to it. I especially love Ed and Holga’s relationship and how naturally platonic it is without needing one of them being secretly in love with the other or something cliche like that. I love how it ties into the overall plot as well with Ed realizing Holga was the mother his daughter loved and deserved. It reinforces the platonic dynamic and gives you an alternative family dynamic without feeling like it needs to justify it or parade it around unlike other movies that see it as a selling point. 

All in all, this movie is amazing and something we need more of. I need another movie with this much depth and sincerity.

1k5dqo6,reddit,"Don Bluth's All Dogs Go To Heaven (1989) never ceases to be a emotional experience, especially when you realize the tragic backstory for some of the scenes","Judith Barsi, the child actress who voiced Anne-Marie, was killed by her dad right after she did the voice-work for the movie. 

The last scene of Charlie (Burt Reynolds) saying goodbye to Anne-Marie, Reynolds' teary voice can be heard because it was real, the actor kept breaking down whenever he voiced his lines as he had to hear the voice of a dead child telling him how much she loved him. 

Judith Barsi struggled to sing the song, [Soon You'll Come Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSMJTSKXtLs), because of the abuse at home and how she related to the song. She broke down crying and they ended up using another girl to dub Barsi's singing. 

The movie itself is a moving and solid picture. I don't think Burt Reynolds getsw enough credit on how good he was in this voice acting role. He even showed he could sing. I like his duet with Melba Moore.

1jo09uu,reddit,I was NOT expecting Pan’s Labyrinth to end like that,"This movie has been on my watchlist for a long time and I finally got around to seeing it tonight.

I thought the special effects were rly well done, especially the CGI given the time this
came out.

I also loved the way this is more of a war period piece than a straight up fantasy, and how it blends aspects of fantasy into its very ground story!

I was honestly expecting for it to be like a Tim Burton-esque “Labyrinth [circa 1986]” where after she first goes into the labyrinth it takes her on a magical journey, but I was pleasantly surprised how much of the storyline is just between the drama of fascists and the resistance. The moments of fantasy act as a nice addition to how Ofelia sees the world as a coping mechanism to the trauma around her (war, her mother’s sickness, etc.)

I am so curious as to what was real and what was just in Ofelia’s head, because Vidal physically picked up the baby Groot fetus thing and threw it into the fire… but then the Pale Man wasn’t there from Vidal’s perspective when he chased her through the labyrinth, so can only she see these spiritual entities or..?

I also just.. I was not expecting for her to die at the end let alone getting shot point blank like that. I haven’t been this shocked watching a movie in a long time, I was lying down and when that happened I shot my head up and sat up in pure disbelief, mouth agape, eyes watering. The ending made me cry fr seeing her in the afterlife reunited with her family and having the “prophecy” fulfilled for the “princess to return to the land of spirits/leave the land of mortals” wrapped up the fantasy aspects of the movie in such a way that made me rethink the meaning of everything fantasy-related that I just watched. 

What i didn’t like about the movie was that there are a few little blunders with the audio syncing  and also seeing someone who’s dead breathe for a slit second mildly takes me out of the movie for a sec, but other than that I give nothing but praise for this film. Praise for the costume designers who adorned the rich environments that brought colorful life into each scene, esp. the fantasy set pieces! Praise for the adult acting and the NOT god-awful child acting muchísimas gracias a Ivana Baquero por darnos un gran performance fr. Praise to how Del Toro worked his craft and made such a unique, eerie, curious, intense work of art that pushes boundaries and major took risks with its characters. Mad respect to u for that Sr. del Toro. What a wonderfully melancholic movie, I can’t wait to see it again with actual subtitles this time when i buy the blu-ray

1jm9nz4,reddit,12 angry men,"This movie wasn’t supposed to surprise me. The ending was spoiled for me long before I even hit play nd to make it worse i had already seen a few key shots on YouTube so going in I thought, 'What is left to enjoy?' Turns out , everything lol
Even knowing the outcome, this movie hooked me in ways I didn’t expect. It is not about what happens it is about how it happens. Watching these 12 strangers argue ,clash nd unravel felt like seeing raw human nature laid bare. Their biases , egos nd frustrations it ia all so uncomfortably real nd that is where the brilliance lies !!
The cinematography blew me away. At first, the camera looks down on the jurors like we are judging them from a distance but as the movie progresses the angles shift. The room feels tighter ,the shots get closer nd by the end, we are looking up at these men. It is subtle but genius without saying a word , Sidney Lumet forces us to respect them , to understand that justice requires effort, humility nd courage.
Speaking of Lumet how is this his debut feature film? The man came in swinging. His ability to pull such distinct layeered performances from his cast is ridiculous. Every juror feels so real like you kinda have met them before lol tthe stubborn one , the quiet one , the loud one who doesn’t shut up etc ..nd yet, together, they form this chaotic but gripping puzzle. Lumet doesn’t overdo anything like he keeps it simple , letting the dialogue nd performances do all the heavy lifting lol . As much as I loved the movie , it doesn’t quite fit the intensity I usually crave in films. Don’t get me wrong this is smart, layered nd almost flawless but it is more cerebral than emotional ,I honestly didn’t feel gutted by it the way I do with darker nd more tragic stories. It challenged me sure but it didn’t hit as hard as I expected

1jzno5m,reddit,"[US] The King of Kings (2025): Y'know, for kids. (Jesus Christ!)","I was made to watch *The King of Kings* yesterday, and I’m still processing the fact that someone watched *The Passion of the Christ* and thought:

“Let’s do that again. But make it adorable.”

There’s no mystery to what this is—it’s a sermon dressed as an animated film. Imagine if *The Prince of Egypt* had less artistry, less heart, and more of that weird Sunday school energy where you’re afraid to ask questions. That’s this.

The movie starts with Charles Dickens (yes, really) telling his kids bedtime stories about Jesus, which somehow becomes the framing device for a full-on Gospel recap. The animation? Think *Pixar meets Playmobil*. Big heads. Smooth, rubbery faces. That eerie uncanny valley where everyone looks like they were designed in a Christian metaverse.

But the tone is the real kicker. One second you’re watching cartoon kids giggle at the manger. The next, Jesus is being flogged behind a post by a dead-eyed Roman doll with a whip. When they lift Funko-Jesus onto the cross, I actually said “no way” out loud.

This movie in the (un)holy baby of tonal mismatch and weird choices: Roman officials are “complex,” but every Jewish character who questions Jesus is a full-on villain with the face of a propaganda sketch. That’s not subtext. That’s just text.

To be clear: If you want to show this to your kids, fine. But don’t pretend this is a movie. It’s a delivery system for doctrine. And at times, it feels like the kind of doctrine that doesn’t trust children to think for themselves.

This’ll be sold as wholesome family entertainment. Personally? I think it’s a little terrifying.",2025-04-15 09:34:29,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,500,265,,0.78,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jzno5m/us_the_king_of_kings_2025_yknow_for_kids_jesus/,Man_of_Stool

Sure its campy notably the infamous ""Stop eating my sesame cake!"" but that's what made it entertaining for me.

1jyg7q6,reddit,An appreciation for the dying art of practical Blood Squibs. There’s just something different about them. It’s one of the last things I feel CGi hasn’t been able to replicate 100% correct. What are some of the greatest blood squib effects in film?,"I love blood squibs. For anyone who doesn’t know, these are practical blood packs put on an actor or stunt person to simulate bullet hits. Are they realistic? No. But there is something visceral and cool about them. And they are becoming a lost art. 

You can see why CGI blood hits have taken over. Blood squibs take ALOT OF TIME. There’s the rigging, the safety, the clean up. There’s none of that with digital. Add it in post and you are good to go. There’s way more control with digital. Far more safety.  

Imagine blowing a take during the final big shootout of Django Unchained? Those were legit blood squibs. And the room’s walls are painted red. The clean up to start again? Hours. That’s a lot of $. 

But for some reason, unless there’s an example I don’t know about, I haven’t seen CGI replicate what a blood squib does. With CGI you get the red mist, but I don’t see the chunks or clothing. There’s a look to squib hits. And I’m sure cgi maybe could get it exact if they really tried, but I don’t think it’s treated as seriously or something important enough to spend precious R&D time on. 

But I also think squibs affect the actors performance. Think of Al Pacino in Scarface. You feel those bullet hits and his body reacts to them. There’s a physical reaction the actors have. When you watch John Wick and John is blasting these guys left, right and centre, you don’t see the actors reacting to them too much. And look I love those movies. But the bullet hits don’t have much of an impact. It’s not visceral. 


 Of course digital makes it easier to remove for ratings. Look at Die Hard 4. Released as PG13 and got an unrated cut for dvd. They added the blood in digitally and it looks awful.  Same many of the “unrated” cuts of movies that originally had PG13 ratings. Awful blood hits. It’s like they all use the same digital file to render the blood. 

 So you can see why it’s dying. For a filmmaker to use legit blood squibs in today’s filmmaking world? I feel that needs to be celebrated. Because everything is going against you. Time, money, and yes safety. To set off a blood pack is requires a small explosive charge. They can hurt.

When I watch John Wick 1-4, or the Deadpool movies, I’m hoping for some legit blood squib action. 

So. In celebration of practical blood squibs, What are your favourite blood hits in cinema? I already mentioned Django Unchained. What else? 

Bad Boys 2 has some great squib work. In the opening scene especially. 

Predator 1 & 2? Jesse Ventura’s death is *chefs kiss*. Total Recall has some beauties. 

Of course one of the GOAT’s and one of the first major uses of a squib was in Godfather. The when Michael avenges his father’s death. Man. The hang time of that blood in the air is beautiful. In fact Godfather has a few great blood sequences. Sonny’s death is amazing.

1k4sfzb,reddit,Free Solo (2018) is NERVE-WRACKING,"Quite possibly the most nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat documentary I've ever watched in my life. My palms were sweaty for like, 90% of the runtime. The way each climb is shot by the filmmakers Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Vasarhelyi can only be described as epic. The grand scale of Alex Honnold's achievement is presented perfectly by the camera work, from the wide angle shots that frame him dwarfed by the massive wall of death he's climbing, to the tight close-ups of his fingers and feet digging into the rock face.

1jwlotr,reddit,Finally watched Arrival (2016) - Instant Favourite,"For the longest time I've had this movie hidden away in my backlog, like a dowagers dark secret. Knew it was supposedly ambitious and the kind of movie that makes you think, but never bothered to read up on it, and I'm glad I didn't spoił it for myself.

A great sci fi story, and probably the most interesting alien movie out there. Granted, I may be biased because I did study linguistics, so the movie was right up my alley, but I get the feeling it's be quite intriguing even if you're not into that particular science.

I am giving the movie a big, fat, enthusiastic 9/10, and now I want to continue with the alien motif. I'll go for Sputnik either tonight or tomorrow, but can't decide what movie to pick as the third.

1jwzgxi,reddit,"After all these years, I finally watched Grave of the Fireflies… and I’m broken.","I went into *Grave of the Fireflies* completely clueless , I had no idea what to expect. But by the time the movie ended, only one thought kept echoing in my mind:

**“Whoever starts the war, no matter who wins or loses, the ones who truly suffer are the people just trying to survive it.”**

The pain, the sorrow, the daily struggle of those living through wartime…it’s unmatchable. Unless you've lived it, you can never truly understand it. And I was in tears by the end.

I came across some online discussions where people were blaming Seita, the brother, saying his pride got them killed. But honestly? I don't agree. During a war, everyone is pushed to the edge , there’s food scarcity, fear of sudden death, bombing raids. Every morning, you wake up wondering if you’ll live to see another day. In that kind of world, the mind doesn't function normally.

Even the aunt, who many view as cruel, was also a victim of the war. You could see how it was mentally breaking her. Seita and Setsuko were just children. Seita had just lost his mother, had no contact with his father or relatives, and on top of that, he had a little sister to protect. How is a child supposed to carry all that?

People say it was pride...but if it was, would he have risked stealing food again and again, even after getting beaten, just to feed his sister? That’s not pride. That’s pure, desperate love. He didn’t have an adult to guide him. He was just a boy, doing the best he could in a world that had collapsed around him.

This movie doesn’t draw a line between good and bad—it shows how **unfair** war is to everyone. And I think this is the **saddest movie I’ve ever seen in my life**. I don’t want to watch it again... but I truly believe *everyone*, especially our generation, needs to see it **at least once**. You’ll learn something that no book or lecture can teach.

Also, that background music , Absolutely unforgettable. And that fireflies scene... the red glow, Seita and Setsuko sitting together on the bench in the night ,that image is forever engraved in my heart.

This movie... it’s more than a story. It’s an experience. And I’ll never forget it.",2025-04-11 20:16:16,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,396,189,,0.76,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jwzgxi/after_all_these_years_i_finally_watched_grave_of/,Kudoshinichi0007

The monkey “bit” works perfectly to support underlying message and somehow did not detract from visual. Not to mention his sober portrayal of himself as a self aggrandizing, selfish, drug addicted, and fame obsessed person. Did not try to make excuses for himself yet I came out a fan. 

Complete Unknown was ok and predictable. Better Man deserves the Oscar noms.

The whole movie builds up this toxic cycle between him and Fletcher, and yeah, it looks like Fletcher is the manipulative villain while Andrew is just this ambitious underdog. But by the end, it’s not that simple. Andrew needs Fletcher’s validation. He’s been so brainwashed that he’ll go to any length for that one moment of acknowledgment.

And Fletcher.. well he’s a wreck too. He loses his job, his respect, everything but still clings to this idea that greatness only comes from suffering. In that final scene, he basically traps Andrew, tries to humiliate him and Andrew still gives him what he wants. It’s messed up. They’re not enemies, they’re enablers.

There’s no real “winner” here. They both pushed each other past the edge. And while it ends with that incredible solo, it’s not triumphant. It’s tragic.

>Production values are top notch, with a shout out to the special effects team for a spectaular set piece involving a pool collapse in Berlin that serves as the highlight of the action sequences. The screenplay by Ken Nolan and Gary Spinelli tries its best to avoid the cliches of the overworked spy genre and manages to help create a worthy character for Malek to run with, maybe not as fast as Jason Bourne, but no less memorable.

[Variety - Owen Gleiberman](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/the-amateur-review-rami-malek-1236362272/)

>This is the third thriller that Rami Malek has made since becoming a star in “Bohemian Rhapsody,” and it nudges his tense, twitchy moodiness even closer to the center of his brand. He’s the right actor to play a digital geek turned mindhunter; those eyes of his glare like lasers. Mostly, though, Malek plays out his methodical mission of vengeance as if it were something almost theoretical. The conceit of “The Amateur” — that Charlie must do all this himself — remains, at heart, a conceit. That’s why the movie is okay but never, you know, killer.

1jqlv9q,reddit,"""Worst"" movie you defend to the death?","I don't mean defend in a ""so bad its good"" way i mean defend in a ""you're all misunderstanding this masterpiece"" kind of way.

For me its AVP Requiem.

And i'll tell you why.

Yes, maybe the lighting was bad but i was watching it on my PC so i never experienced the theater viewing, but i think all of the characters were well characterized, their dynamics well explored. I've heard people complain that we never hear what the main character did to go to jail or why he was friends with the sherrif, but i honestly think there's nothing wrong with that, we don't need to know, the movie does a great job of simply showing that although this guy has a rough past, he very clearly has a very very long relationship with the sherrif, by him getting home from jail it shows him as being bold.

The predalien and the aliens in the movie were extremely intimidating, it seemed like all of the characters, except for Wolf, were completely powerless. The predalien looked awesome as well, so that's a plus.

The movie is also EXTREMELY ballsy in it's edginess, i can't think of many other cheesy action movies for mainstream audiences that kill children and has pregnant women die in horrific ways. Not to mention the attractive love interest being absolutely massacred? I can't think of a single one of the copy-cat summer blockbusters that did that.

1jxcf3q,reddit,Everest (2015) is a surprisingly well crafted movie,"Found it on Netflix and just finished watching, don’t remember seeing anything about it when it came out.

Stars Jason Clarke, Josh Brolin and Jake Gyllenhaal. They had top billing for obvious reasons, Brolin and Gyllenhaal are what attracted me to it, but there’s a lot of actors sharing the screen and they’re all top notch in this movie.

I decided to watch it despite thinking to myself “okay, this is gonna be one of those movies that I can go ahead and play in my mind with probably 70% accuracy.” I thought it was gonna be superficial and formulaic - it was not.

It’s based on a true story of a disaster on Mt Everest in 1996. Won’t go into more detail than that to avoid spoilers.

I doubt the movie would blow anybody’s mind but it’s just a really good, solid film. There’s a lot of human drama that felt very genuine to me, no melodrama. No cheesy dialogue. No caricatures. No actors hamming it up or overacting, in my opinion. No major genre cliches that I can recall. In fact I feel that it’s the type of movie that kinda defies genre, although you could categorize the themes well enough.

Plot wise I didn’t find it predictable at all. If you’re already familiar with the story then I think you’ll find that the events aren’t portrayed predictably. No cheap thrills or cheap sentiment, just real ones. It made me feel shit.

The cinematography is great, there’s a lot of astounding shots of the mountain and surrounding environment. I don’t know if it was IMAX, but I’d have to assume it was because of some of the photography that just screams IMAX. Watch it on your biggest screen

Bridgette Wilson was okay as Sonya Blade. I found her believable in her quest for revenge and her fight scene with Kano worked. I do feel her subplot was quickly rushed out. The one thing I liked about the new MK was that it gave us more Kano and Sonya.

1jzb9wd,reddit,"April 11-13 Box Office Recap: On its second weekend, 'A Minecraft Movie' became the second biggest video game movie worldwide with $552 million. 'The King of Kings' over-performs projections, 'Warfare' opens decently, while 'The Amateur' and 'Drop' underwhelm.","https://preview.redd.it/5wk8mzvkhvue1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ba860803c8b374c941afb76643bcd1250c8556d

Despite four wide releases this weekend, none of them could fight ***A Minecraft Movie*** for the top spot. ***The King of Kings*** delivered Angel Studios' second biggest debut, while stuff like ***The Amateur*** and ***Drop*** failed to light things up, although ***Warfare*** had a solid start.

The Top 10 earned a combined $145.1 million this weekend. That's up a colossal 112.4% from last year, when ***Civil War*** debuted with A24's biggest opener.

***A Minecraft Movie*** was still at #1, adding $78.5 million. That's a 52% drop; not as bad as some other video game films, but it's also quite rough for a family flick. For contrast, ***The Super Mario Bros. Movie*** dropped 36.9% on its second weekend. Through 10 days, the film has earned $278.8 million, and it's still on track to finish with over $450 million domestically.

In second place, Angel Studios' ***The King of Kings*** earned $19.2 million in 3,200 theaters. That's the studio's second biggest debut, behind ***Sound of Freedom*** ($19.6 million). It's also the biggest debut for an animated bible film, surpassing ***The Prince of Egypt*** ($14.5 million), although ***Prince*** sold more tickets adjusted for inflation.

This is promising, and Angel Studios did a fantastic job with marketing. Not to mention having the film open with Easter around the corner, which should help it leg out. Like their prior films, they used the ""Pay It Forward"" feature, wherein someone can pay for a ticket for anyone else. The numbers reported are only those that were redeemed this weekend.

According to Angel Studios, 59% of the audience was female. Despite middling critic reviews, the audience loved it more: they gave it a rare ""A+"" on CinemaScore, indicating strong word of mouth. The film should leg out all the way to $60 million at the very least, especially with no animated competition till June.

In third place, 20th Century Studios' ***The Amateur*** debuted with $14.8 million this weekend. This debut is lower than the recent action film ***A Working Man*** ($15.5 million), although that had a more bankable name in the lead role.

While it's tough to get better numbers, one still thinks that the film could've opened higher than this. After all, Disney and 20th Century mounted an extensive campaign for the film, hoping to replicate other action film successes. But the thing with ***The Amateur*** is that it simply didn't offer anything new in the genre: a man loses his wife and sets out to get revenge. That's a genre that has been copied so many times, and it's tough to get excited for the 37th time it's played out. Even reviews (62% on RT) aren't really glowing.

According to 20th Century Studios, 57% of the audience was male, and 47% was 25 and over. They gave it a so-so ""B+"" on CinemaScore, which doesn't exactly inspire confidence. With options like ***Sinners*** and ***The Accountant 2*** coming up, it'd be a surprise if ***The Amateur*** got close to $40 million lifetime.

In fourth place, A24's ***Warfare*** debuted with $8.3 million in 2,670 theaters. That's A24's sixth biggest debut, and while far off from Alex Garland's ***Civil War*** ($25.5 million), it wasn't ever going to come close to those numbers.

All in all, it's a solid start for the film. War films have been finding success in theaters, although films revolving around Iraq War have been quite inconsistent; some have succeeded (***American Sniper*** and ***The Hurt Locker***), others not so much (***Green Zone*** and ***Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk***). A24 did a great job in emphasizing the film's plot points: a real-time story of soldiers in Iraq. Some fantastic reviews (94% on RT) certainly helped as well.

According to A24, 72% of the audience was male, and 53% was 25 and over. They gave it a great ""A–"" on CinemaScore, which is A24's best grade (their only other film to get this grade was ***The Iron Claw***). This is very encouraging, and suggests the film could leg out. For now, a $25 million domestic total is likely for ***Warfare***.

In fifth place, Universal/Blumhouse's ***Drop*** earned just $7.3 million in 3,085 theaters. That's below other Blumhouse titles like ***The Woman in the Yard*** ($9.3 million) and ***Wolf Man*** ($10 million). These numbers are also below director Christopher Landon's ***Happy Death Day 2U*** ($9.8 million), which was considered a disappointment back in 2019.

Even though the film cost just $11 million, it feels like Universal simply didn't know what to do with the film. Even though they premiered it at SXSW, where it earned great reviews (83% on RT), it feels like they didn't push it hard enough. Or maybe the concept: a woman asked to kill her date to save her family didn't entice audiences. It's not unreasonable to believe that had the film come out during Blumhouse's golden years, it could've opened with $20 million or more. Are audiences giving up on Blumhouse? 

According to Universal, 53% of the audience was female and 35% was in the 25-34 demographic. They gave it a middling ""B"" on CinemaScore; this is not bad, but it's not great either. With some competition on the way, it's unlikely it save some face. It'd be a surprise if the film came anywhere close to $25 million lifetime.

***The Chosen: Last Supper — Part 3*** earned $6 million this weekend. That's a 14% drop from ***Part 2*** ($6.9 million) last week. Across these 3 films, they have amassed $36.3 million domestically.

***A Working Man*** was hit hard by the newcomers. It dropped a steep 59%, adding $3 million this weekend. The film has earned $33.4 million so far, and it looks like it will struggle to hit $40 million domestically.

Disney's ***Snow White*** continues its freefall. The film now dropped 51%, adding just $2.8 million this weekend. Clearly, this film simply has no legs. The film has earned just $82 million so far, and it's guaranteed to finish below $90 million domestically. Terrible all around.

Ninth place belonged to Blumhouse's ***The Woman in the Yard***, which fell 54% and added $2 million this weekend. The film has earned $20.3 million so far, and it's finishing with something close to $25 million.

Rounding up the Top 10 was ***The Chosen: Last Supper — Part 2***. The film collapsed 86% this weekend, earning $961,861 this weekend. Through 10 days, it has earned $10.9 million so far.

#**OVERSEAS**

***A Minecraft Movie*** was still the #1 movie overseas. It added $79.6 million, taking its worldwide total to a colossal $552 million after just 2 weekends. The best markets are the UK ($39.8M), China ($20.3M), Germany ($18.9M), Mexico ($18.7M) and Australia ($18.5M). With this, it has already passed the ***Sonic*** movies to become the second biggest video game movie ever. The billion milestone is becoming more and more likely.

***The Amateur*** slightly over-performed projections overseas, earning $17.2 million for a $32.2 million worldwide debut. The best debuts were in France ($1.6M), the UK ($1.4M), Mexico ($1.4M), Germany ($1.1M) and Japan ($1.1M). Based on the pattern of other action films, the film should hit the $100 million milestone, although some rough competition will put a challenge to that.

***Snow White*** is nearing the end of its run worldwide. The film added just $4.7 million overseas, for a terrible $182.3 million worldwide total. Based on its drops, it looks like the film might go under $200 million worldwide. On a $270 million budget. Ouch.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Moana 2* | Nov/27 | Disney | $139,787,385 | $460,405,297 | $1,059,197,729 | $150M
*Novocaine* | Mar/14 | Paramount | $8,809,436 | $19,861,854 | $33,545,800 | $18M

- ***Moana 2*** has closed with $1.059 billion worldwide. Considering it was heading straight to streaming, that's a huge win for Disney Animation. Even if the quality of the film suffered as a result. The film debuted with a gigantic $389 million worldwide, which was the biggest debut for an animated title. But the film proved to be a bit front-loaded, especially for an animated film. A third film is inevitable, but Disney should really begin development as a film, not a half-assed TV show changed to a film.

- No pain, no gain. Paramount's ***Novocaine*** closed with just $33 million worldwide, failing to recoup its $18 million budget. That's eerily close the numbers earned by Jack Quaid's previous film, ***Companion***. Despite hitting #1 on its opening weekend, the film simply couldn't find an audience in the weeks afterwards. Quaid may be popular online, but that doesn't mean people are paying to watch him lead a movie.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

One film will try to challenge ***Minecraft*** for the top spot.

That film is Ryan Coogler's ***Sinners***, which stars Michael B. Jordan in a dual role in this horror title. Warner Bros. has backed up the film with an extensive marketing campaign, granting Coogler with his terms: the film's rights will revert back to him in 25 years. Coogler has had massive success with the ***Creed*** and ***Black Panther*** films, but this is his first major original film. And early reviews suggest he really cooked: it's sitting at a fantastic 100% on RT with 45 reviews so far. The big question is: will audiences support this?

Every time the usual ""what trope do you hate"" thread shows up, someone mentions the protagonist letting the villain live - bonus points if they mention that the protagonist killed henchmen on the way to the final fight. This sort of comment has become cliched in its own right.

To me, this has never bothered me; usually henchmen are killed in self-defense while the antagonist is typically disarmed and vulnerable.

Additionally: maybe killing the villain in cold blood is the ""right"" move to protect others, but I can't really fault the protagonist for not wanting to do that. I know I wouldn't want to have to deal with the psychological ramifications of that.

1k6yvw7,reddit,'Havoc' - Review Thread,"Director: Gareth Evans

Cast: Tom Hardy,  Jessie Mei Li, Timothy Olyphant, Forest Whitaker, Justin Cornwell

Logline: *After a drug deal gone wrong, a bruised detective must fight his way through the criminal underworld to rescue a politician's estranged son, unravelling a deep web of corruption and conspiracy that ensnares his entire city.*

**Rotten Tomatoes:** [67/100](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/havoc_2025)

**Metacritic:** [59/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/havoc/)

Some Reviews:

[The Hollywood Reporter - David Rooney](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/havoc-review-tom-hardy-gareth-evans-netflix-1236198216/)

>With Hardy in fine form at the wheel, *Havoc* knows what its audience wants. It also looks great, with regular Evans DP Matt Flannery’s dynamic cameras zipping in and out of the bloody fray and textured visuals slashed with throbbing colors. The setting is a city so grim and seedy it seems to exist only at night. The fact that the environments were mostly constructed at a studio in Cardiff suggests there’s lots of ace craftspeople hiding out in Wales.

[SlashFilm - Chris Evangelista](https://www.slashfilm.com/1842207/havoc-movie-review-tom-hardy-gareth-evans/)

>To be clear: I love a good, violent action movie as much as the next dude, but you have to give me something more than just one extreme shootout followed by another. Perhaps if the hyperviolence was a little more stylized it would play better. Instead, it's just ugly stuff repeated in numbing fashion. By the time ""Havoc"" ended, I felt as exhausted as Hardy's beaten and bruised character. I suppose Evans and company deserve some credit for making an action movie that really leans into the brutality, but there's only so much of that you can put up with before it starts to grow tedious.

[Variety - Peter Debruge](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/havoc-review-tom-hardy-gareth-evans-1236375320/)

>There’s a reason big-studio producers looked to Sundance darlings like Colin Trevorrow, Rian Johnson and Jon Watts to handle their tentpoles: not because those guys are great at action, but because they keep the interpersonal dynamics interesting. That’s precisely where Evans wreaks the most havoc, ignoring (or simply not understanding) what connects us to such characters in the first place — and therefore ensuring that his unwieldy Netflix vehicle is dead on arrival.

[NextBestPicture - Giovanni Lago](https://nextbestpicture.com/havoc/) \- 6/10

>After years of waiting, it feels like “Havoc” was never going to reach the pre-conceived levels of hype that it was supposed to live up to. It’s clear that whenever certain moments were filmed years later than the original period of principal photography (mainly due to Hardy’s more than apparent changes in beard thickness), there’s doubt it made any real difference in the final cut that Evans envisioned. Still, when “Havoc” hits, it only reminds us how awesome it feels when Evans gets to do his own thing. Even a flawed Gareth Evans film satisfies more than most action flicks today.

[Empire - Beth Webb](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/havoc/) \- 4/5

>There’s also something refreshingly egoless to it; Hardy may have top billing but takes not only many sucker punches to the face but an entire roof to the head. Around him Evans utilities his full cast, throwing greener actors like Quelin Sepulveda, who plays Charlie’s partner Mia, into the eye of the storm, armed with a meat cleaver and a mission to survive. The result is a throbbing, bone-crunching diorama of violence with the occasional horrifying, glorious flourish (you’ll never want to see a fishing harpoon again).

[Slant Magazine - Jake Cole](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/havoc-review-tom-hardy-gareth-evans/)

>Instead of elaborate exchanges of close-quarters strikes and counters, the characters here tend to get the upper hand based on who has the quickest reflexes in tackling an assailant or getting a block up at the last possible second. Despite the advanced choreography that Evans and Flannery capture with a generally superior sense of visual fluidity than they displayed in the *Raid* movies, there’s an overwhelming sense of chaos here that feels realistic.

[Nick Schager - The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/tom-hardys-havoc-review-the-action-extravaganza-of-the-year/)

>*Havoc* is such relentless, hardhearted business that the squeamish need not enlist. Nonetheless, those with a hankering for escalating insanity will be well satiated by this saga, whose narrative convolutions are untangled in a second half that puts a premium on combat. Disappointingly, Evans (who wrote the script) shortchanges Olyphant in a role that’s barely one-dimensional and receives no stand-out moments—to a large extent because he shares only scant screen time with Hardy. The director makes up for it, however, with a barrage of broken bones and mutilated corpses—and set pieces drenched in slow motion and decorated with flying glass, splinter, and bodily debris—that tips the material into sensory-overload territory.

[Collider - Tania Hussain](https://collider.com/havoc-movie-review-netflix-tom-hardy/)

>*Havoc* might deliver on its promise of blood, guts, and glory, but it’s these committed performances that keep it from completely collapsing under its self-induced chaos. While the vision by Evans swings hard as a stylishly savage brawler, it rarely lands with meaning, which also feels like an injustice to the filmmaker’s incredible past work. Despite a top-tier cast and bone-rattling action to keep you engaged, the Netflix flick buckles under a cluttered story with chaotic execution. It’s watchable, even entertaining in bursts — but beneath all the bruises and broken bones, there’s not much else to hold onto.

[IndieWire - David Ehrlich](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/havoc-review-netflix-tom-hardy-1235117850/?utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter) \- B-

>Rote as Evans’ plot might be, and wasteful as its treatment of certain characters *definitely* is (pour one out for Jessie Mei Li, whose screen time as Walker’s new partner greatly outweighs her purpose to the story), he has a well-developed ear for ice-cold gangster speak, and he isn’t afraid to make people pay a steep price for their penance. It’s enough to forgive him — and/or the movie gods — for making us wait so long to see him do it again. ",2025-04-24 18:01:24,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,318,196,,0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1k6yvw7/havoc_review_thread/,ChiefLeef22

'The Chosen' and 'The Woman in the Yard' had decent debuts, but 'Death of a Unicorn' flopped with just $5.7 million.","https://preview.redd.it/1vs90px2d3se1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2ebc5ef1c093da9fe4611c8661655c971899f16

A $270 million movie couldn't win against Jason Statham.

***A Working Man*** over-performed projections and managed to steal the #1 spot, marking another win for Jason Statham. That was at the cost of ***Snow White***'s second weekend, which had a horrible drop amidst negative buzz and word of mouth. The rest of the newcomers was a mixed bag; ***The Chosen*** had a fantastic debut, ***The Woman in the Yard*** did okay, while ***Death of a Unicorn*** flopped.

The Top 10 earned a combined $68.4 million this weekend. That's off a poor 47.3% from last year, when ***Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire*** opened with $80 million.

Debuting #1, Amazon MGM's ***A Working Man*** earned $15.5 million in 3,262 theaters. This debut is almost on par with Statham and Ayer's previous film, ***The Beekeeper*** ($16.5 million).

All in all, this is a great start, and it's a sign that Statham can still attract audiences to theaters after more than 20 years in the business. The premise and the trailers were basically what you come to expect from Statham: an ""ordinary man"" with a job, who is actually a badass guy who kills bad guys. That's not different from other Statham titles but remember: if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Which might be why Statham is still having a lucrative career, and is also one of the very few actors who only make theatrical films and zero TV shows. No amount of mixed reviews (52% on RT) will change the audience's mind here; with Statham, you know what you're getting.

According to Amazon MGM, 60% of the audience was male and 37% of the audience was in the 18-34 demographic. It was a ""dad movie""; 42% of the audience was 45 and over. They gave it a middling ""B"" on CinemaScore, below ***Beekeeper*** (B+). It's unlikely it can hold as well as ***Beekeeper*** due to the amount fo competition, but it should still finish with over $45 million domestically. Statham already has another film, ***Mutiny***, ready for January 2026 and it should also perform well.

Oh, ***Snow White***.

You know, we're not gonna act like there was hope here. The opening weekend fell way below expectations and the film posted some mediocre weekdays, indicating that the film would not have legs. Yet we weren't prepared for the second weekend drop.

***Snow White*** earned $14.3 million this weekend. That's a brutal 66% drop, which is worse than any of the Disney live-action remakes. It's similar to the second weekend drop of ***Dumbo*** (60.4%), but that film had ***Shazam!*** ($53.5 million) and ***Pet Sematary*** ($24.5 million) as competition, while ***Snow White*** has almost nothing. This drop is a testament of negative buzz and word of mouth that has plagued the film.

Through 10 days, ***Snow White*** has earned a terrible $66.9 million so far. With ***Minecraft*** coming to take away its PLF screens, it will continue falling. One thing is clear from this: the film is gonna miss $100 million domestically, which is simply unbelievable. 

In third place, ***The Chosen: Last Supper — Part 1*** surpassed expectations. Playing in 2,478 theaters, the film earned a pretty great $11.7 million this weekend. By far the best debut in the ***Chosen*** franchise. The second and third parts will be released on April 4 and April 11, respectively.

Universal/Blumhouse's ***The Woman in the Yard*** debuted with $9.3 million in 2,842 theaters. That debut is not far off from Blumhouse's ***Wolf Man***, which disappointed with just $10.8 million back in January.

Considering the very low buzz and anemic pre-sales, this is a very solid numbers. And it's a testament to Blumhouse's strength that they can get a nothing film like this to debut to almost $10 million. Especially considering the weak reviews (43% on RT). Perhaps with very few horror choices, ***The Woman in the Yard*** managed to attract an audience that really wanted to go to the movies.

According to Universal, 55% of the audience was female, with its biggest demo women over 25 (31%). While it surpassed expectations, don't expect this to have a long life in theaters. It got a terrible ""C–"" on CinemaScore, which is the exact same grade as ***Wolf Man***. With competition on the way, it's unlikely ***The Woman in the Yard*** can make more than $25 million domestically.

In fifth place, A24's ***Death of a Unicorn*** flopped with just $5.7 million in 3,050 theaters. That's one of the worst debuts for a film playing in over 3,000 theaters, and it's another A24 misfire after the performance of ***Opus*** two weeks ago.

Comedy horrors can be a tough sell; A24's ***Y2K*** was another one of those which flopped back in December. Even with big names like Paul Rudd and Jenna Ortega attached, they have not found much success outside franchises. And despite the A24 name usually signaling quality, the reviews for the film were very middling following its SXSW debut (55% on RT).

According to A24, 51% of the audience was male and its biggest demo was women over 25 (29%). They gave it a poor ""B–"", which is quite bad for a comedy. With so many options on the way, ***Death of a Unicorn*** will probably finish below $15 million domestically. That'd be disappointing.

GKids re-released ***Princess Mononoke*** in 330 IMAX theaters this weekend, where it earned a pretty great $3.8 million. That took its lifetime total to $14.7 million.

***Captain America: Brave New World*** eased 27%, adding $2.9 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $196.6 million.

***Black Bag*** went from second place to eighth place, dropping 48% and adding $2.1 million this weekend. The film has earned $18.7 million, and it's gonna finish with around $22 million domestically.

***Mickey 17*** is nearing the end of its run. It dropped 47%, grossing $1.9 million. The film's domestic total stands at $43.6 million, and it's going to finish with around $47 million.

Rounding up the Top 10 was Paramount's ***Novocaine***, which continues its collapse. This time, it had a steep 60%, earning just $1.4 million this weekend. The film has amassed just $18.8 million, and it will make just $21 million at most. Practically the same amount as ***Companion***.

***The Alto Knights*** didn't save face on its second weekend. It collapsed 65%, earning just $1.1 million this weekend. Through 10 days, the film has earned an anemic $5.5 million, and it's gonna gonna close with less than $7 million domestically. Pathetic.

The documentary ***The Encampments*** (which follows the 2024 Palestine solidarity campus encampments at Columbia University and other pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses during the Gaza war) broke records despite playing in just one theater (the Angelika Film Center in New York). It earned $76,419 this weekend, which is the biggest per-theater average for a documentary. It will continue expanding in a few weeks.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Snow White*** was still the biggest Hollywood entry, but it added just $22.1 million overseas. And that took its worldwide total to just $142.7 million after two weeks. The best markets are the UK ($8.7M), Mexico ($6.9M), Italy ($6.6M), France ($5.5M) and Brazil ($4.5M). Very brutal all around. With the way it's dropping, the film won't much further than $200 million worldwide. Hell, if ***Minecraft*** surprises, it could go sub $200 million. At a $270 million budget, that's a flop for the ages.

***A Working Man*** debuted with $16.6 million overseas, for a pretty good $32.1 million worldwide debut. The best debuts were in China ($2.9M), Germany ($1.4M), Australia ($1.1M), Mexico ($1.1M), and the UK ($867K). With so many markets still left, this should get to $100 million worldwide easily.

***Mickey 17*** added $5.2 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $120.9 million.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Sonic the Hedgehog 3* | Dec/20 | Paramount | $60,102,146 | $236,115,100 | $491,115,100 | $122M

- ***Sonic the Hedehog 3*** has closed with a fantastic $491 million worldwide. While it was later surpassed by ***Mufasa*** in daillies, the film is not a loser in the slightest. It's hard to be disappointed at a franchise where each film makes more than the one prior. Paramount already found their next big franchise, to the point that they already scheduled a fourth film for March 2027. That one should definitely hit $500 million.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

After years stuck in development hell, ***A Minecraft Movie*** is finally hitting theaters. The film stars Jason Momoa, Jack Black, Danielle Brooks, Emma Myers, and Sebastian Hansen, and follows four misfits who are pulled through a portal into a cubic world that thrives on imagination, having no choice but to master the world while embarking on a quest with an expert crafter named Steve. The trailers have been... quite terrible, to say the least. But despite that, the popularity of ***Minecraft*** is just too big that families will probably still watch it. Let's just hope the final film is less painful than its trailers.

1jsqdg8,reddit,The Secret Of NIMH is probably the single greatest American work of animation,"It's America's answer to Hayao Miyazaki, and I personally prefer it to Miyazaki. I grew up as an anime kid with a strong bias against anything Disney, and it was partially because of movies like this that surpass anything they've ever made tenfold. It blows my mind that Don, (in my opinion) would never again create a work of cinema anywhere near as compelling as The  Secret Of NIMH. I can't think of an other animated movie like it. I consider it to be the greatest children's movie ever made.

The sheer depth of the characters and their relationships, colors, situations, the densely layered and imagined environments the characters live in. The theme music. Back plot and narrative of events we never see that unfolded just before the start of the movie, and connect with the events during the course of the movie. The dark and violent scenes meant to show children the ugliness of blind greed. The mystery element of the necklace, and especially the animation. There's no doubt these are the most expressive and human feeling animal characters ever in a film. I have no idea how they were able to animate them that way. Amazing to see these mice and rats move, speak and behave exactly like human beings. All of the characters are deeply thought out, and balance perfectly against one another. The movie, among many other things, is an allegory of how corrupted, powerhungry people hold down the struggling and the poor. Sure, familiar tale, especially in animation, but it's done so flawlessly in this movie. I feel terrible for any fan of animation who has never seen this. You MUST watch it. It's one of the greatest films I've ever seen, and I feel so lucky that I got to experience it as a child. I remember it moved me to tears even then.

1jl66oi,reddit,Lethal Weapon 4 is a good example on how to handle a forced unnecessary sequel and make it enjoyable,"We all know that feeling, right? When Hollywood milk too much a franchise and you rolls your eyes because there too much sequels and they are kind of useless. Nevertheless, Lethal Weapon 4 is an exception. That movie is kind of underrated but ""full"" of quality. It's a perfect example on how to make a good forced-sequel-that-nobody-asked-for.

Firstly and important point, it acknowledge the aging of the actors (and therefore, their characters) and even allows them to live an evolution. The best thing I suppose is the moment when Riggs use the famous ""I'm too old"" line from Murtaugh, which is a very logical move. But it also keep every running gags and codes of the previous movies to not stray too far from this franchise's nature (this is good too, to not lost the hardcore fans imo) while in the same time, showing new things to still give its own identity to this fourth sequel.

The Triad is an interesting new antagonist and we are even seeing the international debut of a young rising star (Jet Li). I am also kind of surprise by the final fight scene because of various aspect : it's a little more violent than what we are used to and throught this it also cemented the bromance/alchemy of Riggs and Murtaugh. It's also not a duel but a... truel? definitely not what we are used to in an action movie or a buddy cop movie. Last note, I love so much how Murtaugh and Riggs move in different direction (like a cross) when the fight is about to happen, it's very martial movie-like.

Thanks to all this, LW 4 made you feel like you are watching friends or a family that you have been seeing for years. The last scene is the best and almost pretty meta since it totally made you feels like you are a part of the Lethal Weapon family. So, kudos to the late Richard Donner and the whole crew.",2025-03-27 15:10:57,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,215,101,,0.87,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jl66oi/lethal_weapon_4_is_a_good_example_on_how_to/,CitizenTony

1jxdz8a,reddit,Perspective change on the truman show,"
Just finished rewatching The Truman Show for the first time since I was a teenager, and I'm genuinely stunned by how prophetic this film was.

Back in 1998, the idea of someone's entire life being broadcast 24/7 seemed like pure science fiction. Now we literally have people voluntarily documenting every aspect of their lives for strangers online.

The scene where Truman realizes patterns in his world (same people walking past at the same time) reminds me of how recommendation algorithms keep showing us the same content. And when he tries to leave town but encounters obstacles? That's basically what happens when we try to disconnect from social media - there's always something pulling us back in.

The most haunting part was when Truman asks ""Was nothing real?"" That question hits harder now when we're all curating these perfect online versions of ourselves.

Anyone else revisit older films that seem to predict our modern reality in ways that weren't obvious when they were released?

\- This was on the TV like 7 or 6 years ago.

\- Think Toy Story but live action (with actors on set yk) and the bad toys were real bad and had a grudge against the main character.

\- There was an army of toys marching up a river bank.

\- They had killed someone....? I think fire was involved (im not 100% sure tho)

\- The toys were going to atack the main characters.

\- It was either an action, or a horror.

1k2wect,reddit,BACK TO THE FUTURE at 40,"BACK TO THE FUTURE turns 40 this year… so if ‘Doc’ had decided to go 40 years ahead instead of 30, he’d arrive in 2025.

It feels unreal that that the film is 40 (and that I’m pushing 50). I watched it with my 5 year-old this morning and he absolutely loved it!

The script (by Zemeckis and Gale) is still taught at film schools today as an absolutely brilliant example of Three Act structure and how to set-up/payoff. 

So tell me - were you around in ‘85 to see it theatrically? Did a parent show it to you? How do you think the film plays today? For me it works just as well and I even occasionally find things I’d never noticed before.

1jzv8sj,reddit,"For as much as Tom Cruise loves to push his limits of doing stunts, I would love to see him do a modern Buster Keaton style stunt comedy.","Buster Keaton being famous for his courage and willignness to pull of some crazy stunts, giving us some of the best slapstick and stunt comedy films ever made. To this date there hasn't been anybody nearly at his level (and courage) to pull off some of the things he did. 

The closest to him currently is Tom Cruise who has become well known (among other things) for his own willingness to pull of some crazy stunts. As the Mission Impossible series has shown us, as well as Top Gun and other films, Tom Cruise is always pushing his own limits and challenging his own capabilities in his stunt work, all for the sake of cinema. 

For that reason, I would LOVE to see a modern Buster Keaton style slapstick film, feeling like Tom Cruise is the only one with the capability to pull it off. What made Buster Keaton films so great was both the stunts and also the dry deadpan humor. Keaton's stoicism to the chaos around him is something we've seen with Leslie Nielsen in Airplane/Naked Gun. 

Leslie Nielsen experienced a career renaissance that made him a household name in comedy, despite having no comedic chops himself. Simply because he used deadpan humor and being the every man who pretends like everything is normal as the chaos unfolds around him.

This is where I think Tom Cruise would be perfect to do a Buster Keaton style film. As an action star Tom Cruise isn't well known for his comedic chops, but he doesn't need to be. He can maintain the deadpan seriousness and stoicism of Buster Keaton and Leslie Nielson reacting to the craziness happening around him and showing off his stunting capabilities in increasingly absurd situations.

A) The term is immediately followed up by the definition:

THE GORGE

OPPENHEIMER

“It’s a kangaroo court with a predetermined outcome!”

B) Just saying the same thing twice:

MORBIUS

“It’s lethal to bats … but deadly to humans.”

C) Saying out loud what is clearly already happening:

PEARL HARBOR

“I think World War 2 just started…” 

Generic example:

*gunshots are heard and car windows shatter*

“They’re shooting at us!”

Gimme your best.

Edit: Great examples, everyone. Getting a kick out of reading these.

D) Comically redundant *on purpose*

Just to defend my Morbius quote: yeah I stretched it as far as the category goes, but this is still repetitive as hell in spirit. Of course something can be lethal to one animal and not lethal to another, but the wording makes two clauses where there should have been only one.

Carl (Steve Buscemi) calls Jerry (William Macy), says there’s a problem. Jerry asks, “How’s Jean?” Carl pauses and goes, “Who’s Jean?”
Killed me. 
He didn’t even know the name of the woman he kidnapped.

All the ‘yeaaaah’’s always stuck. The accents also did play a huge part in making the movie so loveable. 
They should do a serious sequel with Scotty (the son) and how he grows up all messed up.

You know those movie scenes that just get stuck in your brain and you can't shake them? Not necessarily the best scene ever, or from your favorite movie, but just a single, specific moment that pops up in your head out of nowhere, even years after you've seen it.

What's that one scene for you? What movie is it from, and what's so unforgettable about it? Was it something shocking, something beautiful, something weird, or just a really powerful moment?

Like those flowers that had human-like features, or even the way the crew members started to get mixed up with the environment and each other. That whole visual of nature and people merging in this bizarre, unnatural way was so creepy and unsettling. It really made you think about what was happening in that zone. That whole idea of things losing their boundaries and becoming something else… yeah, that sticks with you. Coming from a person with plant biology background may be a reason.

1juirmg,reddit,Kelly LeBrock: The Woman in Red whose career never reached the promising start she got,"I like Kelly LeBrock. She had a unique look and when you saw The Woman in Red, you couldn't take your eyes away from her. She emulated Marilyn Monroe but made it her own. Sure, it stretched credibility that she'd ever be interested in grumpy, aging Gene Wilder but that movie was always a male fantasy. 

That's what LeBrock was, a male fantasy. I thought she was a good actress but men were mesmerized by her body and iconic lips. She then did Weird Science, playing a virtual woman, created by two geeks, and that film became a instant cult classic. In the 80s, she was the perfect woman. 

So what happened? Two words: Steven Seagal. She married the famed martial arts movie star, after working together in Hard to Kill, and the troubled marriage lasted 9 years. 

She barely acted but while her film career went up in flames, she did turn to a good cause, helping the Terminally ill by being a spokesperson for Club Carson, a foundation helping children with cancer. 

A good woman, her film career didn't rise to the potential she had, but she has used her fame for a worthy cause and this is what matters the most. 

And she's still stunning.",2025-04-08 17:07:59,movies,movies,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,160,57,,0.84,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1juirmg/kelly_lebrock_the_woman_in_red_whose_career_never/,CinephileCrystal

1jse0uz,reddit,Man I miss New Line Cinema when it was its own separate studio.,"Back in the 90’s to mid 2000’s  they were one of the most balliest studios in Hollywood that took chances on quirkier movies like Austin Powers, The Mask, or Elf that even back then the other majors would’ve never done. And give up and coming directors like David Fincher and Paul Thomas Anderson their breakouts. Heck they manage to greenlight all three Lord of the Rings in one go. 

They were like the equivalent to a punk rebel teenager  doing movies their way 

Unfortunately that’s what killed the studio after Return of the King putting whatever out there and most of them were box office failures or absolutely terrible like Son of the Mask or Hoot and  then spending $180 million on The Golden Compass which bombed so hard that Time Warner decided to it was enough  to absorb it into Warner Bros. 

And now it’s just a small label under WB  that makes some horror movies and 2 or 3  movies in other genres  that’s kind of forgotten about within a couple of months. 

But at least WB still keeps that legacy going but I do have the feeling in 5 years they'll eventually retire the name.

I feel like New Line's spiritual successor is Lionsgate where they still make smaller budgeted quirkier movies that other studios wouldn't dare to do.

But if I do, any action or industrial noise or sweeping orchestral score is going to blow the roof off. It's anti-social if I live near anybody. This isn't a professionally-outfitted cinema. This is home viewing.
