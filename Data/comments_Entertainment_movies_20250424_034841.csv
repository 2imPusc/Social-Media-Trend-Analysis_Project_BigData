movies,1jt4etu,mls66t3,"My husband and I took our niece and nephew to it. They are both big Minecraft fans. We've never played a second of it and know basically nothing about it except the basic premise and color scheme.

I expected to be bored to tears, unimpressed, and probably annoyed by the chatter of an audience full of kids.

I actually was...pretty amused. The parts in the real world were actually fairly funny, Jack Black was allowed to just ham it up as hard as he could (no pun intended), it seemed pretty self-aware as a dumb movie, and the potty humor wasn't quite at an obnoxious level. It was kind of fun to see Jason Momoa to get his ass handed to him by every critter in the world. The only thing I really *hated* was the tween lead, who was capable of exactly one facial expression and whose lisp seemed forced. 

It's the same directing team as Napoleon Dynamite and Nacho Libre, and that really shines through in a few parts, so if you hated those movies you'll certainly hate this one.",215,2025-04-06 23:48:03,spaghettifiasco

When he says “I never liked that name” or whatever to brad and ryan, he’s trying to jump ship and change careers, just as one might make up some excuse about a gap on their resume during a job interview.

movies,1jo3nv7,mkpr3hf,"I have my issues with Basterds and Tarantino as a whole, and I'd never accuse the man of being too subtle. But I do think that what you're pointing out isn't just a sly detail, but the entire point of the film. You can kill Hitler (and you should), but the most insidious Nazis will find a way to avoid consequences and scurry elsewhere, almost unscathed.

Like you said, Landa isn't terrifying because he's a true believer—it's because he *isn't*. The circumstances of his situation allowed him to commit atrocities with little to no consequence, and be awarded a life of status and comfort for doing so. My takeaway wasn't that he betrayed the Nazis, but that he saw what the Basterds' infiltration represented. If the Germans could be so thoroughly compromised and lured into a death trap, it would *keep happening*, even if he exposed them in that moment. Better to force a winning hand now and join the victors as soon as possible.

Furthermore, Landa had no idea if there was a greater force elsewhere. An invasion. More spies. He could expose everyone in the theatre and still die to their backup or their contingency plan. So he arranged a way to create a life of status and comfort for himself after the war.

This literally happened. Operation Paperclip. The many Nazis who used so-called ratlines to flee to Uruguay and Argentina—countries without extradition treaties. And everyone knows it, which is why Raine and Little Man make sure that, even in his relative safety, Landa is robbed of the ability to become truly anonymous.",51,2025-03-31 17:09:11,NowGoodbyeForever

movies,1jo3nv7,mkq381o,"I’ve always felt it was obvious that Hans wasn’t *really* a Nazi, like not a true believer.

Yes, he obviously worked for the Nazis. Yes, he obviously held some Nazi viewpoints. Yes, he does a lot of Nazi shit. But it’s all a paycheck to him. He doesn’t actually give a shit if Germany wins the war. He doesn’t give a shit about killing Jews are pushing Nazi ideology on the world. He’s the kind of guy who would have just as quickly worked with the Basterds if he were American and there was enough benefit in it.

Even the way he talks, feels like a guy doing a job. He quotes propaganda almost verbatim. Does he truly believe it? Maybe. But much more likely he exactly that - a parrot just repeating what he’s been told. He says things like “I work for the Nazis” not identifying himself as one. As OP mentioned, even the nickname “Jew Hunter” is something he leverages differently depending on his angle.

I’m not saying he’s opposed to the Nazis, nor am I saying he can’t possibly be at least somewhat of a supporter. I’m simply saying that the most obvious interpretation is that he’s a psychopath working with whoever benefits him the most.

Therefore, his betrayal not only makes perfect sense, it would make no sense if he didn’t do it.",14,2025-03-31 18:08:24,Misterfahrenheit120

He’s so casually dedicated, and really good, at his profession that’s it’s just treated as a simple fact almost. The scene where he threatens to deport an agent if they don’t speak up like it’s an average Tuesday for him, his calm and collected reaction to his wife’s infidelity and him thinking about what that implies for his mission and holding course because of that, swimming in that public pool in the freezing cold every morning no matter what’s going on or what’s just happened. Truly methodical and detached and wholly dedicated to the agency and it freaked me the fuck out aha.

movies,1js2mnh,mljc450,"*Wit*, with Emma Thompson.

>Professor Vivian Bearing (Emma Thompson), an expert on the work of 17th-century British poet John Donne, has spent her adult life contemplating religion and death as literary motifs. Diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer, she consents to an aggressive and experimental form of chemotherapy administered by Dr. Kelekian (Christopher Lloyd) and his assistant, Dr. Posner (Jonathan M. Woodward), her former student. Facing death on a personal level, she reflects on her life and work.

[Trailer](https://youtu.be/NPoGXqNV_wc)

Why I found it disturbing: Professor Bearing has spent her entire life treasuring her intellect and wit which have carried her far. As she struggles with the side effects of a particularly brutal (yet ultimately ineffective)l regimen of chemotherapy, she feels those slipping away.

Similarly, HAL 9000 pleading with Dave Bowman not to kill him haunts me, too. ""My mind is going... I can feel it... I can feel it.""

EDIT: Found this interesting writeup of the film:

Quoted:

>The film Wit depicts several ethical violations including lack of compassionate care, inadequate informed consent, and a focus on scientific achievement at the expense of the patient's well-being. These issues highlight critical flaws in the medical ethics guiding patient treatment. The narrative criticizes the tendency for healthcare professionals to overlook the emotional and physical needs of patients in favor of research objectives.

movies,1jztmq0,mn8orod,"On its face, the new film *Warfare* resembles a traditional military drama. But the movie is really a portrait of “the incremental, tedious surrealism of war,” writes David Sims.

The director Alex Garland’s 2024 film, *Civil War*, was “gritty, realistic, and often horrifying to watch, but it was fundamentally a flight of fantasy,” Sim continues. Its follow-up, *Warfare*, is a “tougher pill to swallow than its predecessor.”

Garland wrote and directed the movie in collaboration with Ray Mendoza, a former U.S. Navy SEAL who also served as the military adviser on *Civil War*. The film re-creates an operation from the 2006 Battle of Ramadi, during the Iraq War, when things went punishingly awry for Mendoza’s unit. “Where *Civil War* envisioned a dark future, *Warfare* conjures a specific, harrowing day from Mendoza’s past,” Sims explains. “What’s fascinating is how so much of the film commits to the waiting that exists during battle: the taxing, dull tension of knowing that something might happen any minute.”

*Warfare* is a “complete rejection of the typical storytelling rules for how to portray action: that it should have peaks and valleys throughout a three-act structure,” Sims writes. Instead, the film “is anticipation, then chaos, then a cooldown for relief.” Featuring cast of young stars on the rise, including Will Poulter, Charles Melton, Noah Centineo, Kit Connor, Joseph Quinn, and Cosmo Jarvis, there’s a “thrill in trying to piece together each person’s role amid the things that are going wrong with the group’s mission,” Sims continues. “We watch the men respond differently to the unexpected attacks they face and process the tension growing within their outpost.”

Most of the servicemen in *Warfare* have to learn to embrace the frustration and confusion that can come with wartime conflict, and viewers are encouraged to do the same. Still, “*Warfare* is a “bluntly neutral” film, Sims writes. It “depicts a circumstance that many audiences would likely never want to experience,” and “it’s all the more crucial, then, to stare down the frightening ambiguity without narrative assuagement.”

That Derek's rhetoric doesn't seem sufficient to justify his actions is a result of both his duplicity and the hollowness of the movement's beliefs--if spoken plainly, people dismiss them out of hand.

Please head over there if you have any questions/comments for Peter. He'll be back on Tuesday to answer.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Peter Stormare will be joining us on /r/movies for an AMA/Q&A on Tuesday 4/22 at 12:30 PM ET. The post will go live before that (maybe even today) and will be pinned to the top of the sub. His credits are too lengthy/impressive to fully list:

https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001780/

His newest film, **Until Dawn**, is out in theaters nationwide next weekend.

> One year after her sister disappeared, Clover and her friends head to the remote valley where she vanished to search for answers. Exploring an abandoned visitor center, they soon encounter a masked killer who murders them one by one. However, when they mysteriously wake up at the beginning of the same night, they're forced to relive the terror over and over again.

It's directed by David F. Sandberg (/u/dauid), director of **Lights Out**, **Annabelle: Creation**, and both **Shazam!** films.

Transformers One was incredibly well executed - the character development, the colours, the cameos and Easter eggs dotted through the whole thing.  Even Bumblebee was decent enough comic relief.

movies,1jjy32g,mjrczy5,"To your point about Bumblebee being annoying, yeah he was, but in the end I think it made the movie better. He is childish comic relief for the kids to latch on to and relate with, but in the dark and serious moments he's not funny. He takes it seriously, he understands the gravity of the situations and doesn't crack a joke to break the tension. 
When the gang sees the surface for the first time all he says is ""I'm speechless"" and lets a beautiful awe inspiring scene be just that. During the revelation in the cave he reacts appropriately with pain and dispair at the realization that his entire life is a lie. During the execution of Sentinel and rise of Megatron he's not yelling ""knife hands"", he's scared and he fights with desperation instead of the zany antics we saw just moments before. He behaves like someone who just watched one of his best friends murder 2 people (one being another of his best friends) then collapse in on themselves and begin a violent rampage.
The contrast between his stupid quips and the more serious moments gives those scenes much more weight because of his presence and the glaring lack of comic relief when you most expect it.

movies,1k19giz,mnklm38,"I straight up haven’t watched this movie because I think it would actually trigger me. I used to weight almost 500 pounds, and a large part of your paycheck at that point is shame in yourself for getting that weight, hatred of yourself, a feeling you can never lose the weight. That’s even before you factor in the societal shaming that occurs.  

A lot of people want to treat you like garbage because it makes them feel morally superior. And because those people do exist (and you hate yourself), you start feeling like anyone you see is judging you.

I’ve lost nearly 300 pounds, gained half of it back, and lost half of that again. And what I’ve learned is that unless people really know you, they will 100% define you by your weight. People will judge anything you do more harshly when you’re morbidly obese and be willing to forgive things when you’re a healthy weight.

It’s not about ""earning"" love or forgiveness. It’s about reaching out one last time from a place of deep despair. His choices are tragic, yes, but painfully real for anyone who's been close to that level of hopelessness.

Previous century Flat earthers were a joke, most were to ashamed to confess their view publicly. Nowadays you have entire subreddit, YT/TikTok/Facebook/Instagram channels genuinely (not satirically) dedicated to that opinion.  
  
When you have people who think that **Homelander** is a hero, you can't expect critical thinking from them. I had to explain that **Gordon Gekko** is an iconic bad guy a la Darth Vader rather than the hero. When the director of **American Psycho** laments that people misunderstood ~~his~~ **her** movie and love **Patrick Bateman**, you can't expect people to understand the motive and psychological intricacies of a complex character.

If they let Angel move into the cottage right away, he might decorate it in a way that doesn't keep with the villages aesthetic and might lead to a negative impact on their score.

The D&D movie would not have turned out as well as it did if it weren't for their direction. A fine example is the older live-action Dungeons & Dragons movie released in the year 2000. Absolutely awful. 

The two directors were also behind the movie Game Night (2018) and you can feel their brand of comedy balanced by solid characterization extended to the latest D&D movie.

D&D:HAT unfortunately bombed, which makes me wonder if these two directors will ever get a shot at making big projects again due to ""director jail.""

I also loved how the Faun was friendly but could also be scary. Both the Pale Man and the Faun were portrayed wonderfully by Doug Jones. He and Del Toro have worked a lot together where he’s played other creatures like Abe Sapien in Hellboy and the Amphibian Man in The Shape of Water (another great film). He has a role in the TV series What We Do In The Shadows where we once again get to see his creature work but also his face. It’s been fun because I’ve been able to recognize him by his style when he’s in other movies.

The real middle finger is calling it ""A Serbian Film"", which inseparably ties it to the average person's familiarity with Serbian movies, which is the last kind of perception the government would want people to have of their art scene.

movies,1jsl254,mlnejzo,"I've heard a mix. Some folks say that if you understand the history and culture of the Balkan region, it does satirize some aspects of that. Others have said that the director (the actual person) has a history of claiming his work is deeper than it really is.

I don't know either way, but I do think a little of what it says about pornography and how it is often linked to crime and violence (just by nature of all three of those things being taboo)        is kind of interesting from an American perspective, where violence in the media is considered a frequent issue.

My take is that I think the character of Milos and what the director (the character) puts him through are pretty standard horror fare. Like the director is obviously a deeply disturbed person and Milos just wants to be a family man, and those themes work together. There are a lot of movies where the relatively normal protagonist gets in over their head with an over-the-top madman.

I also think shock plays a part in that story. However, I totally understand people who think it goes too far. To me, the ending is meant to be ridiculous, like it's a cartoonish plot that is pretty divorced from reality, which happens a lot in horror. Milos literally kills a guy by sticking his penis into the man's eye. To me, the juvenile aspects seem to be the point. But it plays with fire in that it builds the ridiculous plot with acts that are automatically repulsive to a good percentage of people, even if they're not taken seriously. 

So when it comes down to brass tacks, I don't think the movie is completely without merit. I think there are some ideas in the film about violence and the human desire to see and experience forbidden things that may not be fully formed, but they are there.

The real question is whether or not the subject matter, especially what happens in the last 20-30 minutes, overshadows that, and I think that's a personal judgement call.

I sorta half said without looking up ‘Ah great book…. Giraud’s art is brilliant.’  Then I hear that sorta nasal tone pipe in and say ‘yea man, his shit in inks is awesome.’

I kinda went *hey I know that voice* and looked up and it’s QT, dark glasses and not really looking like what you would expect.  I said hello and kinda frazzled and said the first thing that popped in my mind: ‘Dude, Robert Forster was robbed for Max Cherry.’ (I absolutely adored Max in *Jackie Brown* and still think he should have got that Oscar) and he grinned and said ‘yea I know.’

He picked up a few Blueberry graphic novels and said see ya and walked off to pay.  I was so star struck I probably looked like a large mouth bass.  

Years later, he brought out *Django* and it occurred to me that maybe he was doing research or something while down for panels.  Or maybe he just liked good stories.

>This movie wasn’t supposed to surprise me. The ending was spoiled for me long before I even hit play, and to make it worse I had already seen a few key shots on YouTube so going in I thought, 'What is left to enjoy?' Turns out, everything (lol).

>Even knowing the outcome, this movie hooked me in ways I didn’t expect. It is not about what happens, it is about how it happens. Watching these 12 strangers argue, clash and unravel felt like seeing raw human nature laid bare. Their biases, egos and frustrations... It is all so uncomfortably real and that is where the brilliance lies!! 

>The cinematography blew me away. At first, the camera looks down on the jurors like we are judging them from a distance but as the movie progresses the angles shift. The room feels tighter, the shots get closer and by the end, we are looking up at these men. It is subtle but genius without saying a word. Sidney Lumet forces us to respect them, to understand that justice requires effort, humility and courage. 

>Speaking of Lumet how is this his debut feature film? The man came in swinging. His ability to pull such distinct layered performances from his cast is ridiculous. Every juror feels so real, like you kinda have met them before lol: the stubborn one, the quiet one, the loud one who doesn’t shut up, etc. And yet, together, they form this chaotic but gripping puzzle. Lumet doesn’t overdo anything like he keeps it simple, letting the dialogue and performances do all the heavy lifting lol . 

>As much as I loved the movie , it doesn’t quite fit the intensity I usually crave in films. Don’t get me wrong this is smart, layered and almost flawless, but it is more cerebral than emotional.  I honestly didn’t feel gutted by it the way I do with darker and more tragic stories. It challenged me, sure, but it didn’t hit as hard as I expected.

movies,1jwev1e,mmj6k84,"The movie's final scene with the Iraqis in the streets shows how pointless this war really was. 

It was interesting to compare it to BlackHawk Down where every actor/soldier got a star moment or story beat. In Warfare, some soldiers, including leadership, were genuinely stunlocked and could not fully process what was happening. Surviving an IED will definitely do that to you. Also, for the thousands of bullets they shot in this town, I think they showed only like 2 Iraqis get hit in the entire movie. This is not a criticism of the soldiers or calling them bad at their job, it was just so real to reaction of their situation. 

It was truly choas with the first tank noping out of there in the beginning, then the soldiers being denied more tanks until they had to pretend being a Commanding officer on the Radio to get the approval to risk damaging expensive tanks for a second attempt and lastly the soldiers risking their lives to pick up the hardware they left in the open street. I am aware that they are trained not to leave weapons behind because they will be used against them in the future, but it's pretty clear that the director focused on the hammer on the street in the shot over the guns to highlight what is considered more valuable than lives.",563,2025-04-11 08:51:42,l_Banned_l

This is also their first full length animated movie, and lordy, does it show. characters are constantly in motion, over animated to the point of being overdosed on caffeine or something. The are far too animated when talking. Eyes, head, hands, body, constantly moving as they will die if they stop moving. They also have unnatural swaying movements while doing anything.

Setting aside subject matter, the whole thing is almost a technical disaster on same level as Norm of the North.

>There was also a mayoral race going on in that small town. One of the candidates “had enormous influence over this particular town, because he was an old oil money family kind of guy,” the filmmaker shared.

movies,1k320uj,mnyn3wv,"Look, the stunts in these films are pretty cool in this way, but two things:

One, it sort of risks becoming a Metastasian situation where the story is built around the stunt rather than there being a story and them going ""hey, this cool stunt could quite easily fit HERE."" The stunts are becoming a little too much the MVP of the piece.

Two, there's one really BIG stunt like this in each Mission Impossible film so the overall effect is becoming diluted AND it's just not enough to sustain a two-hour-ish film if the story isn't up the snuffs. This was the case for me with the latest entry - the part one to this part two - and to a lesser extent also with Fallout.

By contrast, Rogue Nation and to a lesser extent Ghost Protocol were more sparing with insane stunts but they worked well on a story level: To my mind, they represent a peak for this series. It also helps that they did not attempt an interconnected storyline, unlike Fallout and Death Reckoning: that was an unnecessary burden for these films.

But beneath the façade of their supposed ideal life, a storm is brewing – as Theo’s career nosedives while Ivy’s own ambitions take off, a tinderbox of fierce competition and hidden resentment ignites.

The film will be released on August 29 through Searchlight.

Directed by Jay Roach (Bombshell, Meet the Parents, Trumbo) and written by Tony McNamara (Poor Things, The Favourite, The Great)

Based on the novel 'The War of the Roses' by Warren Adler, which became a movie in 1989 by Danny DeVito

movies,1jqu808,ml9nlqd,"""Last year, it was announced that 2025 would see the release of two Predator movies. One of these we know is Predator: Badlands, a feature film directed by Dan Trachtenberg of The Predator: The Hunt. The other, until now, is a mystery.

The only clue as to what this movie might be came in October of last year when Gizmodo said it had heard a ""rumor"" that the film is an animated anthology with three stories of the Predator fighting great human warriors. One of these would be a samurai, and the other a pirate. Now, Omelete can confirm that this rumor is correct.

The new Predator movie is indeed an animated anthology with the monster hunting humans in different times and countries. What we don't know is what the theme of the third story is, which could be where Trachtenberg will make his promised sequel to The Hunt. And, as reported by journalist Jeff Sneider, the name of the film is Predator: Killer of Killers.

The animation will be released in the middle of the year, before Badlands in November. 20th Century Studios has suggested in the past that Killer of Killers will be released directly to streaming.

Predator: Badlands will arrive on November 7, 2025, inheriting the window freed up by the removal of Blade from the MCU calendar.

We know little about the story of Badlands, but the film has two main characters: Thia and Tessa. The first spent most of her life in a laboratory and now adventures around the world. The second is marked by a militant intensity when it comes to her goals and those of her family. Elle Fanning (Maleficent, The Great) will play one of the two.

Unlike the other Predator films, Badlands is set in the near future. In addition to this film, Trachtenberg is also working on a sequel to The Hunt, continuing the story of the Native American protagonist played by Amber Midthunder during the colonization of North America.

The Predator films focus on the encounters between humans and alien beings from a race that has hunting as its religion, purpose and main entertainment. The first film in the Predator franchise was released in 1987, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger in the lead role. Two sequels were released. In 1990, Predator 2 came out, which took the action from the jungle to the city and starred Danny Glover in the lead role. In 2010, we had Predators, a film that brings together several dangerous humans in a hunt against various adversaries.

In addition, Predator had two crossovers with the character Alien in the films Alien vs. Predator. Predator, from 2004 and 2007. The film The Predator, from 2018, served as a failed reboot for the franchise, raising possibilities of sequels that seem to have been entirely discarded.

Predator: The Hunt, released in 2022, is available on Disney+.""",43,2025-04-03 21:05:02,acautelado

It would've been awesome to hear his thoughts on that scene.

Also, I'm a bit surprised by how blunt he is and I respect his honesty. Not a lot of people tend to openly talk about being wrong or making bad movies.

I guess I sort of felt like he caused his sister's starvation, but he wasn't responsible for it. And in the end, he starved too, so the outcome may have been inevitable.

The aunt I maybe put a little more responsibility on. What did she actually expect the brother to do? He says clearly his school and factory were bombed, and he has no parents, and nobody else is looking after his sister, and she didn't try to get them to stay or look for them when he said he was leaving.

I love the practical effects of the first one and I don't mind rewarding them one movie ticket if they somehow find a way to up the ante on them. Visually, this one looks pretty damn good.

Tbh I only even considered the movie because I love Josh Hutcherson. After the absolute insanity of Futureman, I told myself I'd forever give a chance to anything he's willing to put himself in. So I got stoned and watched FNAF when it went on peacock, and it wasn't a masterpiece but it was fun enough, and I was pleasantly surprised at Mathew Lillard being in it as well.


Overall I probably won't ever bother to watch the first one again, but I'll gladly see the second one.




P.S. Futureman is one of the most stupid ridiculous shows I've ever enjoyed watching and I highly recommend it even though I strongly suspect most people willing to take my recommendation will end up thinking it's a trash show.

Past an opening scene, they spend nearly the entire movie as either ambiguously harmless or actively friendly with the main characters in what feels like a catastrophic miss for a game that was about being stalked by creepy animatronics. I know it wasn't actually going to be scary scary, and there's even a good argument for making them team up with the protagonists by the end, but it should have at least *tried to make them creepier for even slightly longer,* rather than so immediately setting them up as total best friends - it felt like the biggest miss possible.

movies,1jqnwid,ml8ds4i,"I will say one thing I did appreciate about A Complete Unknown was that they avoided trying to ""explain"" Dylan,  the idea of Dylan being this allusive force who acts as this shifting representation of the culture at the time is interesting. The way he engages with people like Baez and Seeger is interesting, this idea that he can take folk music to places it's never been and gives it a chance to have a real impact, but then leaves it behind is most interesting when it's depicted with real melancholy, Edward Norton does a brilliant job with that, and the stuff with Woody Guthrie is great too. However I don't think the film does enough with those interesting elements, there's a really great movie hiding in there somewhere, instead we just get a decent film instead.

 I don't know if Better Man was super groundbreaking but it was very well made and fully entertaining. If you're a fan of Robbie, it's probably more fun but even if you aren't, it's not like unfamiliar songs dissuade people from watching Disney movies. 

The main character being a metaphor incarnate was more cheesy than clever but you really hardly even notice after the first 15 minutes. It also saves the trouble of worrying about whether the actor looks the part enough.
