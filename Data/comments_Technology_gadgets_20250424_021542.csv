gadgets,1jpolgt,ml0qsay,"From the article: Nintendo has finally shared many of the key specs about the Nintendo Switch 2 as part of its Switch 2-focused Direct. The system launches on June 5th.

The device has a 7.9-inch screen, but it’s still 13.99mm thick, like the first Switch. The LCD screen has a 1080p resolution, and supports HDR and up to a 120fps refresh rate.

The Joy-Con controllers are bigger, too, and as hinted at, they can be used similarly to a mouse. (Though a footnote says that mouse mode will only work with compatible games.) And they stay connected to the Switch 2 via magnets.

It has 256GB of internal storage, up from 32GB on the first Switch. As shown in the Switch 2’s initial reveal trailer, it also has two USB-C ports for connecting accessories and for charging.

When using the dock, you can play games at up to 4K resolution at 60fps. The dock also has a fan to keep the system cool.

The new C button can also be used to activate a chat menu that lets you access controls like muting your voice during the Discord-like “GameChat” calls.

To help users better understand the features of the Switch 2, Nintendo will also be releasing a Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour paid digital game that will be available on launch day.

The game cards for the Switch 2 will be red, a change from the black cards for the original Switch. The system also supports MicroSD Express cards, but original MicroSD cards for the Switch are not compatible.",872,2025-04-02 13:31:27,chrisdh79

gadgets,1k4f004,mo9go5v,"From the article: As I reported just last week, cheap-yet-awesome retro handhelds are being marched to the guillotine in the name of Trump tariffs. One of the first companies to have its head on the block is also one of the most prolific. Handheld maker Anbernic told customers Sunday that it would stop all direct shipments to U.S. customers, at least until President Donny finally offers any clarity on how much people will pay in import duties for products from China.

Anbernic is known for its enormous library of handheld video game emulation hardware. These handhelds are able to use console emulators—essentially full video game consoles translated into software—to play new homebrew titles as well as digital copies of older games, known as ROMS. In a page describing the new shipping policy, Anbernic said “due to changes in U.S. tariff policies, we will be suspending all shipping from China to the United States starting today. We strongly recommend prioritizing products shipped from our U.S. warehouse.”

Until today Anbernic let customers ship products either directly from China or from it’s U.S. warehouse, where supplies were more limited but products would ship out faster. It’s unclear how long the current supply of consoles in the U.S. will last. I reached out to Anbernic for comment, but did not immediately hear back. The handheld maker said it would update customers when it received “confirmed updates regarding import duties.”

Fortunately there’s more than one way to get a console from Anbernic. You might still be able to find its products on Amazon, or AliExpress. The dropshipping site typically sells these handhelds for much cheaper than you could get elsewhere, too. The classic Anbernic RG35XX Plus Game Boy-like device goes for $48 on AliExpress, $50 on the Anbernic site, and a whopping $80 on Amazon. As American supplies dwindle we can assume those prices will increase.",70,2025-04-21 14:33:35,chrisdh79

Remember the 240 watt limit on USB-C is only for 48v output. I believe if you're sending 12v, it's limited to 60 watts. To go above that, your device probably needs a DC-to-DC converter, which is adds costs and reduces efficiency.

There have been over 100 cases of owners whose chips have died after working for a short amount of time, and for no obvious reason.

Reddit user natty_overlord compiled a [list](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASRock/comments/1i5iy9a/update_and_summary_on_the_dead_9800x3ds/) of all 108 Reddit posts involving a Ryzen 7 9800X3D that died. The chips passed POST and worked for varying amounts of time before dying with no signs of failure.

What's interesting is the brand of motherboard these failures occurred on. 98 of the cases, or 82%, happened on Asrock boards, though that could be due to their popularity as a more budget-friendly board maker. Tom's Hardware notes that the company released a new firmware update for AM5 motherboards in February that improved boot problems in AMD 9000 series CPUs.

“Don’t Copy That Floppy” was a slogan before valve existed. I think her husband’s recollection in this instance is correct “we always intended to release DRM”.

The music industry was already being devastated by the time Steam came round. I can’t believe a marketing exec in the software and entertainment industry needed a “wow the piracy thing might impact sales” in 2003. Also Microsoft had moved to requiring online/phone activation for windows xp and office 2 years before Steam and she worked as an exec at Microsoft so she surely was aware of the somewhat universal acceptance by that organization that online activation was the solution and would be tolerated by users.

It inspired not the Steam DRM, but the cd-key used on the original release of Half-Life, years before Steam even launched. Obviously, the impact of CD burners and piracy were widespread by 2003, so the anecdote doesn't quite make sense in that context. But they were much more novel in the 90s:

>In the final weeks of Half-Life’s development, Mike was working furiously on some of the game’s final code. For Mike and Monica, it was stressful and tense because they knew exactly what was at stake. The rest of the team had mostly finished their work. Finally, in November, the game went to duplication and they had a ship party where Mike broke open a pinata filled with candy to everyone’s cheers. After that day, it was eerily quiet, almost like purgatory. In those days, it still took a while to get boxes out to retail and start getting feedback on how the game was actually selling.

>At the time, consumer-level piracy was just becoming a real issue. Monica’s nephew had just used a $500 check she had sent him for school expenses to buy a CD replicator, and being the nice guy he was, he sent a her a lovely thank you note saying how happy he was to be able to copy and share games with his friends.

>“I knew he wasn’t a bad kid – he just saw the world differently – a generational change, combined with new technology put our entire business model at risk,” Monica said.

>Because of gamers like Monica’s nephew, Valve implemented an authentication scheme where customers had to validate and register their copy with Valve directly. Soon, gamers were flooding the message boards saying that the game didn’t work. It was enormously stressful. For a few days, Mike called everyone he could find who complained about the authentication – and NONE of them had actually bought the game. Which meant the authentication system was working extremely well. It felt like a near-death experience.

>Then, in early December, as game industry reviews started coming in, the Wall St. Journal article appeared with the title “Valve’s Storytelling Game is a Hit.”",4,2025-03-27 01:29:31,TheOvy

It's really hard to say how many cards need to be binned because they have failures & how many need to be binned just to meet market demand. I wouldn't assume that any 9070 you buy will be stable flashed as a 9070xt, but I suspect most every 9070 has some disabled cores that are functional.

Hopefully AMD doesn't disable the feature for consumers, it's bad for business if Dell & OEM can get more than they paid for (and make the cards appear less reliable in the process), but if a consumer with a bit of knowledge and skill can squeeze out a bit extra it may well be worth the good will.

You just have to gate the process behind some technical skill which leaves a record to prevent warranty abuse. An easily cuttable lead or resistor would do it.
