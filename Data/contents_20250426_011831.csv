1jrdz46,reddit,Live Asteroid Event Tracking with NASA API Integration,"Take command of your own virtual spy satellite with the Sentinel Spy Satellite Simulator - NASA API Edition! This interactive Python-based simulation puts you in the pilot’s seat of a high-tech orbital observatory, blending real-time NASA data with an immersive ASCII art experience. Powered by NASA’s open APIs (EPIC and NeoWs), this tool fetches live Earth imagery coordinates and asteroid proximity alerts, merging them seamlessly into a dynamic satellite control interface.

What It Does: • Real-Time NASA Data: Pulls live telemetry from NASA’s EPIC API (Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera) for authentic latitude,

longitude, and timestamps, plus NeoWs API for near-Earth object events. • Interactive Simulation: Control your satellite with real-time commands—scan sectors, transmit data, or repair systems—via intuitive keypress controls (S, D, C, T, R, Q). • Dynamic Events: Encounter randomized space hazards like debris fields or asteroid alerts (with real NEO data), requiring quick decisions to evade or intercept. • ASCII Art Display: Watch your satellite animate in retro-style ASCII art, with visual states reflecting health, scanning, transmitting, or repairs. • Persistent State: Tracks your satellite’s health, solar power, data collected, and missions completed, saved between sessions.

Features:

• NASA API Integration: Uses your NASA API key (or the included demo key) to fetch real data, with robust fallback to simulated telemetry if NASA’s servers are offline (e.g., during rare 503 errors).

• Sound Effects: Optional Pygame audio for boot-up, events, scans, and transmissions (requires sound files: boot.wav, event.wav, scan.wav, transmit.wav).

• Cross-Platform: Runs on Windows, macOS, or Linux with Python 3.x, requests, pygame, and colorama libraries.

• Customizable: Adjust frame speed, log missions to satellite\_log.txt, and tweak solar power regeneration rates.

• Educational & Fun: Perfect for space enthusiasts, coders, or educators wanting to explore NASA data interactively.

How to Use:

1.  Install Python and required libraries (pip install requests pygame colorama). 
2. Add your NASA API key (get one free at api.nasa.gov) or use the fallback mode.
3. Run the script, by putting satellite\_animation.py on desktop then run in terminal cd \~/Desktop hit enter then run python3 satellite\_animation.py

Whether you’re a developer curious about APIs, a space geek dreaming of orbit, or a creator looking for a unique project, this simulator delivers an out-of-this-world experience. Download now and launch your satellite into the cosmos!

Note: Includes full source code (Python) and setup instructions. Sound files sold separately or create your own.

1jrbdqn,reddit,Programming my e-commerce app to send custom metrics [OpenTelemetry],"I've been a user of default/ infra metrics for a while. Recently, for work, I  started playing with custom metrics when I was trying to wrap my head around OpenTelemetry. Used a simple e-commerce app to experiment and play around. 

Couple of insights,  
  
\- Ability to get tailored data. For example, number of users who leave mid-checkout, average cart-size at a point in time.  
  
\- I worked with Flask, and instrumenting it was a smooth process. Used the `opentelemetry-sdk` and `opentelemetry-api` to manually instrument the Flask app. While OpenTelemetry does provide auto-instrumentation for Flask, I needed custom metric generation inside business logic so opted for manual setup.  
  
\- I used SigNoz for visualisation, which doesn't charge extra for custom metrics, which was different from some other platforms. 

I've noted my findings in a blog and some examples \[with code\], give it a read, if you guys also use custom metrics or have plans to try it out!  
  
\[Disclaimer - I work at SigNoz\]  
  
It'd also be cool, if you can tell me how you have implemented custom metrics for any project/ work?

1jo3lnz,reddit,Lessons from Rollbar on how to improve (10x to 20x faster) large dataset query speeds with Clickhouse and mySQL,"At Rollbar, we recently completed a significant overhaul of our Item Search backend. The previous system faced performance limitations and constraints on search capabilities. This post details the technical challenges, the architectural changes we implemented, and the resulting performance gains.

Overhauling a core feature like search is a significant undertaking. By analyzing bottlenecks and applying specialized data stores (optimized MySQL for item data state, Clickhouse for occurrence data with real-time merge mappings), we dramatically improved search speed, capability, accuracy, and responsiveness for core workflows. These updates not only provide a much better user experience but also establish a more robust and scalable foundation for future enhancements to Rollbar's capabilities.

This initiative delivered substantial improvements:

* **Speed:** Overall search performance is typically 10x to 20x faster. Queries that previously timed out (>60s) now consistently return in roughly 1-2 seconds. Merging items now reflects in search results within seconds, not 20 minutes.
* **Capability:** Dozens of new occurrence fields are available for filtering and text matching. Custom key/value data is searchable.
* **Accuracy:** Time range filtering and sorting are now accurate, reflecting actual occurrences. Total occurrence counts and unique IP counts are accurate.
* **Reliability:** Query timeouts are drastically reduced.

I recently open-sourced a little repo I’ve been using that makes it easier to run **Puppeteer on AWS Lambda**. Thought it might help others building serverless scrapers or screenshot tools.

📦 GitHub: [https://github.com/geiger01/puppeteer-lambda](https://github.com/geiger01/puppeteer-lambda)

It’s a minimal setup with:

* Puppeteer bundled and ready to run inside Lambda
* `chrome-aws-lambda` support
* Simple example handler for extracting HTML

I use this setup in **my side projects**, and it’s worked well so far for handling headless Chromium tasks without managing servers.

1k5it2y,reddit,TargetJS: A Novel JavaScript UI Framework for Simplified Development and Enhanced User Experience,"I have always been drawn to the JavaScript literal object. It is expressive, compact, and readable, if only there was a way to execute it. But JavaScript didn’t guarantee property order for a long time, until ES2015, which finally made the order predictable. It also introduced the shorter method syntax. This made the object literal more powerful and even more compact.

This inspired the core idea behind TargetJS:

* Provide an internal wrapper (called ""targets"") for both properties and methods of the literal object.
* Execute the targets sequentially in the same order as the code is written, using the framework's execution cycle.
* Enable a functional pipeline between adjacent targets.
* Add lifecycles, looping, and timing to targets so they can execute or re-execute themselves when a condition or time is met. This also makes the functional pipeline even more powerful as we will see later.

That's the basic idea.

To make the framework suitable for front-end development, TargetJS allows CSS styles to be integrated into the same object as targets especially since CSS styles closely resemble JavaScript object literals. To enhance style property utility, we added value iteration, so we can animate styles easily.

**What does TargetJS solve?**

TargetJS addresses several common pain points in front-end development:

1. Complexity of Asynchronous Operations: TargetJS addresses this by providing a structured, synchronous, and predictable execution flow, allowing developers to avoid asynchronous operations altogether.
2. Scattered State Management: In TargetJS, state management is inherently handled through its core concept of Targets.
3. Boilerplate and Verbosity: TargetJS code is compact and follows a predictable execution flow. Method calls are not allowed, and loops and conditional statements are rarely needed.
4. Rigid Static Layer of HTML: TargetJS minimizes reliance on traditional HTML and CSS, allowing JavaScript to be the primary player, resulting in a better and more dynamic user experience.
5. Disjointed Development Workflow: Developers often juggle multiple tools and concepts (UI libraries, animation libraries, state managers, event handlers). TargetJS provides a *unified* solution, simplifying the learning curve and development process.
6. Difficult Animation Control: TargetJS makes animations first-class citizens.
7. Performance Bottlenecks with Large Lists: TargetJS optimizes rendering for large lists by using a tree structure that renders only the visible branches.

1jybljz,reddit,"Coding in MiniScript Feels Like Python or Lua – Simple, Clean, and Fun","I've been experimenting with [MiniScript](https://miniscript.org/) recently, and I have to say—it's surprisingly enjoyable. If you're into lightweight, clean scripting languages like Python or Lua, you'll probably feel right at home. The syntax is super minimal, and yet it’s powerful enough to build full games.

What really makes it shine is using it with [Mini Micro](https://miniscript.org/MiniMicro/) — a tiny virtual machine for making retro-style games. It genuinely feels like coding on an old-school computer from the 80s or 90s, but with modern comforts (like instant code reloads and visual feedback). Perfect for prototyping ideas or just having fun with game dev in a nostalgic way.

It’s honestly refreshing to work in such a small, focused environment. If you're tired of bloated engines or just want to mess around with a simpler toolset, I highly recommend checking it out. Also, you can use it for game jams!

Disclaimer: It's not self-promotion, [Miniscript](https://miniscript.org/) is made by Joe Strout, and I am just sharing my experience, its really fun :)

Anyone else tried it? Or have you used similar minimalist tools for game dev?

Some more game examples:

* OLTP vs. Batch Processing
   * Online Transaction Processing (OLTP): Managed real-time user interactions via screens, developed using CICS and IMS.
   * Batch Processing: Handled bulk data operations, processing large files, datasets, and databases. Jobs were scheduled using JCL and managed by job schedulers.
* Data Interchange - Initially relied on batch transfers, FTP, and EDIs for machine-to-machine communication.
* Evolved into API gateways, XML messaging (XMS), and modern EDIs for faster, more dynamic data exchange.
* Reporting & Analytics - Early systems ingested large datasets into reporting databases, which later evolved into data warehouses and data marts for structured analytics.
* Security - Early mainframes used RACF (Resource Access Control Facility) for strong authentication and authorization .",2025-04-01 06:15:06,programming,programming,technology,Technology,[],0,0,0,,0.22,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2EAw1y-kWA,Lifecoach_411

1k6e202,reddit,Open source zero-code test runner built with LLM and MCP called Aethr,"I was digging around for a better way to run tests using AI in CI and I stumbled across this new open source project called [**Aethr**](https://github.com/autifyhq/aethr). Never heard of it before, but it’s super clean and does what I’ve been wanting from a test runner.

It has its own CLI and setup that feels way more lightweight than what I’ve dealt with before. Some cool stuff I noticed:

* Test are set up entirely through natural language
* Zero-config startup (just point it at your tests and go)
* Nice built-in parallelization without any extra config hell
* Designed to plug straight into CI/CD (works great with GitHub Actions so far)
* Can do some unique tests that without AI are either impossible or not worth the effort
* Heavily reduces maintenance and implementation costs

There are of course, limitations

* Some non-deterministic behavior
* As with any AI, depends on the quality of what you feed it
* No code to back up your tests

Anyway, if you’re dealing with flaky test setups, complex test cases or just want to try something new in the E2E testing space, this might be worth a look. I do think that this is the way software testing is headed. Natural language and prompt-based engineering. We’re headed toward a world where we describe test flows in plain English and let the AI tools run those tests.

1k3q0st,reddit,Swarm Debugging with MCP,"Everyone’s looking at MCP as a way to connect LLMs to tools.

What about connecting LLMs to other LLM agents?

I built Deebo, the first ever agent MCP server. Your coding agent can start a session with Deebo through MCP when it runs into a tricky bug, allowing it to offload tasks and work on something else while Deebo figures it out asynchronously.

Deebo works by spawning multiple subprocesses, each testing a different fix idea in its own Git branch. It uses any LLM to reason through the bug and returns logs, proposed fixes, and detailed explanations. The whole system runs on natural process isolation with zero shared state or concurrency management. Look through the code yourself, it’s super simple.

If you’re on Cline or Claude Desktop, installation is as simple as npx deebo-setup@latest.

[Here’s the repo. Take a look at the code!](https://github.com/snagasuri/deebo-prototype)

[Here’s a demo video of Deebo in action on a real codebase.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/141VdQ9DNOfnOpP_mmB0UPMr8cwAGrxKC/view?usp=sharing)

Deebo scales to real codebases too. Here, it launched 17 scenarios and [diagnosed a $100 bug bounty issue in Tinygrad.](https://github.com/snagasuri/deebo-prototype/blob/master/memory-bank/9bd38e9840d3/progress.md)

The result shows that they only consider comprehensibility and correctness as their factors for trust and don't (or couldn't due to lack of tools) assess for safety and maintainability of the code. We also found that developers can't assess the correctness of the code correctly; therefore, there's a gap between the perceived correctness and the actual correctness, which makes them alter their trust in already trusted AI code generation.

1k4c7g8,reddit,A multi-language codebase with symbolic abstractions — would love feedback from systems thinkers,"**I've been building a complex system that blends multiple languages (Python, Ruby, TypeScript/React) to explore how software can model not just logic but layered meaning. It's not your typical CRUD stack — this project uses a dialectic structure where each knowledge entry has a main point, a counterpoint, and a counterfactual. There's also a custom lexical network (think a dynamic ontology of stems and familiar terms) and experimental logic layers inspired by mathematical structures.**

I've just published a deep-dive comparing this approach to conventional best practices — especially Stanford-style architecture, modularity, naming, and testability. I’m not rejecting best practices — I value it  — but this system takes a more experimental, recursive approach and I’d love critical, thoughtful feedback from devs who think about structure, semantics, and system design.

If this sounds interesting, the article is here: [The Longer Version](https://seriace.substack.com/p/analysis-of-seriaces-symbolic-scroll)

I know the system might seem overengineered or even eccentric, but it wasn’t built to be clever — it was built to model relationships between ideas in ways that flat logic sometimes misses. That said, I’m still looking for collaborators who can help refine it, simplify parts, and connect it back to more standard tooling. If you’ve worked on DSLs, symbolic reasoning, recursive data, or you’re just into bending the usual paradigms — would love your take.

(And yeah, I know some naming conventions are… unconventional. Open to ideas.)

1jwegdm,reddit,How To Solve The Dual Write Problem in Distributed Systems?,"# Understanding the Dual Write Problem

In a microservice architecture, services often need to update their database and communicate state changes to other services via events. This leads to the **dual write problem**: performing two separate writes (one to the database, one to the message broker) without atomic guarantees. If either operation fails, the system becomes inconsistent.

For example, imagine a payment service that processes a money transfer via a REST API. After saving the transaction to its database, it must emit a *TransferCompleted* event to notify the credit service to update a customer’s credit offer.

If the database write succeeds but the event publish fails (or vice versa), the two services fall out of sync. The payment service thinks the transfer occurred, but the credit service never updates the offer.

This article’ll explore strategies to solve the dual write problem, including the **Transactional Outbox, Event Sourcing, and Listen-to-Yourself.**

For each solution, we’ll analyze how it works (with diagrams), its advantages, and disadvantages. There’s no one-size-fits-all answer — each approach involves trade-offs in consistency, complexity, and performance.

By the end, you’ll understand how to choose the right solution for your system’s requirements.",2025-04-11 01:37:32,programming,programming,technology,Technology,[],0,0,8,,0.44,https://medium.com/@lucas.rj.fernandes/1744cb7b08ae,Nervous-Staff3364

1jlygi7,reddit,"Rust-like Result<T, E> for TypeScript? Check out rustify!","Hey devs,

Made a small library, rustify, bringing Rust's Result<T, E> (Ok/Err) pattern to TypeScript.

If you're tired of lots of try/catch or null checks for errors, this might help make things clearer.

Quick Example:

    import { Ok, Err, wrapInResult } from ""@ghaerdi/rustify""; // Wrap something that throws, like JSON.parse
    
    const safeParse = wrapInResult(JSON.parse);
    const result = safeParse('{""hello"": ""world""}'); // Ok({ hello: 'world' })
    console.log(result.unwrapOr({})); // -> { hello: 'world' }
    const badResult = safeParse('{invalid'); // Err(...)
    if (badResult.isErr()) {
      console.error(""Parse failed:"", badResult.err());
    }

Handles success/failure explicitly and is type-safe.

You can install via npm/jsr: @ghaerdi/rustify

Feedback welcome!

I recently put together a deep-dive analysis on what’s happening in the programming world right now — and honestly, it’s one of the most turbulent times I’ve seen in over 7 years in the industry.

Some key points I cover:

* The ongoing wave of layoffs and why it’s *still* happening in 2025
* How AI tools (Copilot, GPT-4.5, Claude 3, Gemini Ultra) are automating more coding tasks — and what that means for programmers
* The paradox of layoffs *and* a skills shortage, especially in AI, security, and cloud
* Why the demand is shifting from routine coding to architecture, integration, and AI literacy
* Emerging roles like AI Ops, prompt engineering, and AI governance
* The impact on both junior and senior devs, and how to adapt

I tried to make it a no-BS, realistic look at the challenges *and* opportunities ahead.

1k3e0ax,reddit,Model Context Protocol - Exhaustively Explained,"Hey Redditors 👋,



I recently published a deep-dive technical blog on the Model Context Protocol (MCP)—a rising open standard introduced by Anthropic to let AI agents interact with external tools, data sources, and systems in a consistent and secure way.



🧠 What is MCP, in a nutshell? Think of it as the USB-C for AI agents. It allows LLMs to interact with real-world systems (APIs, files, databases, SaaS apps) using a common protocol that supports context fetching, tool usage, and secure operation. MCP removes the need for M×N integrations by standardizing the interface.



📘 The Blog Covers:



What is MCP and why it matters for AI

The M×N problem vs M+N elegance

Client-server architecture and message patterns (JSON-RPC 2.0)

Tools, Resources, and Prompts: the primitives

Transport options like HTTP + SSE

Security considerations (auth, isolation, rate limiting, audit logs)

Strategic adoption advice for enterprises



🧑‍💻 I also built a working demo on GitHub, using:



FastAPI MCP server exposing a sample tool via JSON-RPC

SSE endpoint to simulate real-time event streaming

Python client that lists and invokes tools via MCP

🙏 What I'm Looking For:

I'm looking for feedback, improvements, and ideas from:



Architects implementing GenAI in production

Engineers working with agents, tools, or LangChain

AI security folks thinking about safe LLM integrations

Devs curious about protocol design for agent frameworks



I would really appreciate a review from folks who think critically about architecture, protocol interoperability, or just love breaking down new standards.

I am not someone who is lucky enough to work on frontier technologies. I try my best to catch up with evolution and share my learning with others who may not have the time I spent to learn the subject.
