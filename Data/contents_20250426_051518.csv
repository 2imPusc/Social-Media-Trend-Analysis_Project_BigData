1jmp1tg,reddit,Iceland and Norway Itinerary,"Hello everyone,

I'm planning a self-guided trip to Iceland and Norway from late September to early October this year. After doing my own research, I organize my itinerary (rough draft, thought of build up the structure first then go further).

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/12p3V1QpF_APsg0fhA0DkwIHDFy9bRGn1e0-XUJzB4Zg/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12p3V1QpF_APsg0fhA0DkwIHDFy9bRGn1e0-XUJzB4Zg/edit?usp=sharing)

Since my time is limited, I want to focus on breathtaking natural landscapes and unique Arctic Circle experiences. Of course, I absolutely must see the Northern Lights in the Arctic region. Do you have any tips or tricks for maximizing my chances? 

Feel free to comment in the document above. I’d love to hear your suggestions or advice regarding my travel plans! 

I also have a few specific questions that I hope you can help me with:

Iceland's Ring Road self-drive itinerary: ChatGPT suggested skipping the Westfjords and Snæfellsnes Peninsula. Is it really impossible to cover these areas within my timeframe? Also, I’ve heard that apart from Reykjavík, other areas in Iceland are not very developed for tourism, with sparse populations. Would this pose any inconvenience for travelers?

Norway in a Nutshell tickets: I read that buying individual tickets for each segment is much cheaper than purchasing the official tour package. However, some people say that if you book each segment separately and one leg is delayed or disrupted (e.g., due to a strike), it could affect the entire journey. On the other hand, the official package provides assistance in case of disruptions. What’s the best approach here?

Transportation from Bergen to Lofoten: I couldn’t find any direct flights from Bergen to Lofoten. It seems that I have to fly to Bodø first and then take a ferry. How can I check the ferry schedule? I only found various cruise package tours but not standard ferry routes.

Activities in Tromsø: Apart from Northern Lights chasing, what other Arctic experiences would you recommend? (e.g., ice fishing, reindeer experiences, etc.) Are there any recommended tour operators for such activities (like Klook or KKday)?

Additionally, if you have any local recommendations for restaurants and accommodations, please share them with me.

With the website on PC, sometimes the website would never load. Or if it did load, it might make it as far as to show us the flight options, only to tell us say ""no flights available"" when we tried to get further. This happens too in the Spanish version of the website.

With the Android app, as soon as the app homepage loads, if you try to click anything, it tells you ""An unexpected error occurred"".

Volaris is not a small airline. For an airline to get that big, surely there must be some way of successfully booking with them?

1jmgk5r,reddit,Which should I choose? Bali-Manila or Bali-Singapore-Hanoi,"**Hi guys! Can you help me decide + share your cost/experience for my planned trips?**

My planned trips:

July 25-July 30 - Bali with family

July 30 - They'll be going home to Manila

I was supposed to go straight to Hanoi with my sister to meet with friends but her friend cancelled so she's going to Manila with my family. My friend already booked her ticket so I'm still going to Hanoi. The problem is, she'll be arriving on August 2. Thus:

My two options:

1. I'm going home to Manila to rest and repack, then I will fly to Hanoi on August 1
2. I will fly from Bali to Hanoi, through Scoot. So other than it being the cheapest flight + there's a Singapore layover too. (Singapore in July 30-31, Hanoi in July 31-August 1)

My situation:

\- I am not a solo traveller, and this will be my very first solo travel (Singapore-Hanoi for a few days). I am a bit wary but also, I know I can hold my own (23, female, I look like a victim, but I can hold my own in the countries mentioned, they're very safe).

\- I want to choose whichever is cheapest + worth it

\- If Option 1 is significantly cheaper (Bali-Manila-Hanoi) (by around USD 80-100), I'll choose Option 1

\- If Option 2 is significantly cheaper, or only slightly more expensive than Option 1, then I will choose this for the experience. Again, USD 80-100 is the cost difference I can tolerate

I attached the image of the cost comparison, based on the current price of flights right now (+ image attached).

I'm still not entirely sure of the realistic cost of the Speeing Pod, Food, and Activities in Singapore for a layover flight, and Acommodation and Food in Hanoi. I am researching it inmy spare time, but I also want to hear your suggestions!

**What I need help with:**

1. Can you share your experience/cost in either or both Singapore and Hanoi?
2. If you can weigh in on what is the better option based on experience in the same flight/destinations, I would love to hear your thoughts!
3. What was your experience solo travelling?

I am the type of traveler that most hate. I love photography, so I take photos a lot, it is the highlight of my trip for me because I can enjoy it after the trip pa hehe. I love wearing cute clothes, but I am willing to bring less/maneuver the luggage situation, so I only bring 7kg for Option 2. I want to stay longer in one place to appreciate it and explore every nook and cranny than going everywhere. I am less of a traveler and more of a vacationer, so I might not enjoy Singapore if I'm exhausted but it's Singapore, so I think I'll enjoy even if I stay in the airport and only leave for the city center for dinner.

Please be kind, even if you don't agree with my travelling style. I just wanted to hear the thoughts of veteran travellers/those who have done the same trip as the one I'm planning. Thank you.

If I missed any details, please ask. I will kindly provide more context, I just think my post is already too long.

1jmanpd,reddit,Antigua or Mexico city in May? Open to other suggestions,"Hi all,

Looking to take my girlfriend of three years on an international trip in late May, as she hadn’t been out of the country a ton. I travel a lot for work so unfortunately my windows of availability to leisure travel are the best.

I’ve been to Latina America, Asia and am very comfortable in foreign countries, but want to choose not too adventurous of a place to ease her into things. That said, two places I’m looking at are Mexico City and Antigua. Both are tourist friendly and have direct flights from LAX, which is a huge plus as well probably only have 4-5 nights. We are the type of people who can have a blast doing both city and nature things, so both are very appealing. 

Downside is that May is the beginning of rainy season and I’m wondering which of these is better, or if it wouldn’t be worth it.

1jlm9rm,reddit,August 10 day road trip through the Balkans- help me choose route!?,"
Hi y’all, I have 10 days in the Balkans, and my husband and I are renting a car. We love moving around, seeing different landscapes, and don’t mind a packed itinerary. I really want to experience the mountains and alpine scenery, but I also want to get down to the southern coast of Albania. My husband, on the other hand, is set on seeing some of Croatia.

We know that renting a car in Croatia and dropping it off in Albania can be tricky, but we’re open to working around it. Here are two rough route ideas—would love your thoughts on how to divide our time or if you have a better suggestion!

Route 1: Just Albania
	•	Tiranë
	•	Shkodër
	•	Theth (Albanian Alps)
	•	Albanian Riviera (Vlore or Himarë?)
	•	Maybe a ferry to Corfu
	•	Back to Tiranë to fly home

Route 2: Croatia to Albania
	•	Dubrovnik
	•	Kotor (Montenegro)
	•	Shkodër
-would LOVE to fit a teth ntl park in here if possible 
	•	Vlore
	•	Tiranë to fly home

I love the idea of seeing the transitions between different countries, but I’m struggling to balance beach vs. mountain time. How many days would you recommend in each place? And is one of these routes a clear winner?

Would love any advice or alternatives! Thanks!",2025-03-28 03:47:18,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,3,7,,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jlm9rm/august_10_day_road_trip_through_the_balkans_help/,Automatic_Intern_440

1jkriru,reddit,Seeking Advice from locals and experienced travellers for my World Trip,"Cheers, everyone ;)

Please excuse grammatical errors or spelling mistakes; it's not my native language. c:

Here's some info about me so you can get a better image of what I might know or don't know.

I'm a m/20 from austria. German as a native language and English on a C1 level (I'm better at speaking than typing). I already had the privilege to visit many different countries with my family, resorts, and hotels, so mostly crowded beaches and cities. As an introvert, I feel much better discovering cozy rural towns, finding secret beaches, or experiencing beautiful natural scenery.

The countries outside of Europe I have visited so far are:

* Turkey | Antalya
* Egypt | Hurghada
* Maledives | Olhuveli Island
* Thailand | Phuket, Patong Beach

I always wanted to travel the world, and now after I graduated high school and served my mandatory military service, I'll finally be able to fulfill my dream of traveling Asia by car for roughly 5.5 months (24 weeks).

I will start from Austria and drive all the way to Turkey in the first couple of days without much of a stop. After Turkey, Georgia, and finally Azerbaijan, I'm going to take a ferry at Baku over the Caspian Sea to whatever port in Kazakhstan. My research got me to the point that there are regularly ferries that transfer from the Caspian Sea to ports in Kazakhstan. The tickets for the ferry can be bought locally at the port, to my knowledge. After I arrive in Kazakhstan, I'll finally start with the main part of my journey. The car I use for traveling is an old VW bus and is already edited for traveling. There's a bed in it as well as a little kitchen and an external shower. Electricity is also being produced by solar panels on top of the car. I am just going to travel from town to town and decide on the go what I would like to see today. The entire way from Austria to Baku, Azerbaijan, is not supposed to be any longer than 1 week. In Kazakhstan I will roughly spend 2 weeks.

The next country would be Kyrgyzstan, which was one of the reasons I wanted to do this journey so badly. I have heard nothing but positive things about this country, its nature, its people, and its food. I'm maybe going to spend 2 weeks there.

Next stop, PR China. Sadly, it is not possible to drive in China with an Austrian (EU) driver's license without any additional burdens. Even with an international driver's license (which I possess), it is not possible to drive in China without the Tourist Driver's Allowance. It can be obtained by a multiple-choice test regarding Chinese traffic signs and an ophthalmologist's certificate. Since I will enter PR China in the middle of the desert, I wanted to ask how the hell I'm supposed to get to a doctor who can hand me such a certificate and where to do that test. I really have not found a good solution for this problem so far, so I would appreciate any help or correction if I got anything wrong. If I find a solution regarding this problem, I would spend 1 week in China until I enter Mongolia.

Mongolia, also a country I wanted to travel to very desperately. I will roughly spend 2 weeks in Mongolia.

I'm going to enter the PR China again at this border control: [https://maps.app.goo.gl/NhXnLnneP4qrhQjg6](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NhXnLnneP4qrhQjg6)

I will continue to drive eastwards to Peking, then Tianjin, and after that I will stay at the coast all the way south till I enter Vietnam. I'm probably going to stay a little bit in Shanghai and Peking, but as I already mentioned earlier. I prefer nature over cities, so maybe I will find some pretty places along the way. Estimation for PR China is 4 weeks.

I'm putting together Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand here since I am probably going to cross the border a couple of times probably until I enter PR China north of Thailand again. Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand will also roughly take 2 weeks.

Thailand will be just a brief visit since I have already visited it, and it simply is a target for a later journey.

Bhutan and Nepal both together will take 3 weeks since I would like to take some time for myself in the NP Annapurna.

India is the next big country I'm going to spend a lot of time in. Mostly at the north side close to the Himalayas. 3-4 weeks is what I'm supposed to spend in India until I re-enter PR China and make myself back on the way home. From entering the PR-China, I'm going back on the route from Kaxgar to Almaty. From there, all the way across Kazakhstan to the port, I arrived and back with a ferry to Baku. From there, the same home I arrived in in the first place. From India until home, I estimated 3 weeks.

After arriving in Austria, I will continue my journey westwards to Gibraltar, where I will park my bus and hitchhike a sailboat. In online forums, I have heard of a concept called hand against cot (""Hand gegen Kojüte"" in German). Hopefully I will find a ship pretty soon there that's crossing the Atlantic at a cheap price or, at best, for free. After arriving wherever in the Caribbean, I'm going to take a flight to Buenos Aires, where there are ""frequent flights"" to Río Gallegos in the south of Argentina. There I would buy a used/cheap motorcycle and travel from South America to North America for another 5.5 months (24 weeks). I would sleep in a tent and live off daily groceries like noodles or local food. I'm not going to lean into singular countries regarding a route or time estimations since I believe I can decide pretty much on the way what I would like to see in what time. But rough estimations are

South America—2.5 Months (11 Weeks)

* Brazil 2 Weeks
* Argentina 3 Weeks
* Bolivia + Chile 3 Weeks
* Peru + Colombia 3 Weeks

North America—3 Months (13 Weeks)

* Panama + Costa Rica + Nicaragua + Honduras + Guatemala 2 Weeks
* Mexico 3 Weeks
* USA 4 Weeks
* Canada 4 Weeks

I'm also not quite sure on how to get from South America to North America in the cheapest way possible.

My overall budget for the gas, food, water, etc., so basically for the entire journey, will be €17,000 (the bus is already paid, so it's just the motorcycle).

Thanks for reading this very, very long and detailed plan of my world trip. If there are any missing information in this text, route optimizations, tips for beautiful secret places the tourists don't know about, or even just a comment regarding this idea as a whole. I appreciate it. ;)

I have an issue and having a hard time getting a solution. 

We're a group of students, including a Chinese student, travelling home with this itinerary with Aer Lingus:

DUB → AMS   
22 May 18:20 - 20:55

We all bought our tickets together, and she got her visa for US but now this transfer in Dublin is confusing us. It says:

""If both your arrival flight and onward connecting flight are in Terminal 2 between the hours of 04:00 and 16:00 on the same day, you can use a transit visa in this case."" 

China is not on the list of of countries that needs this, but the connecting flight is after the 04:00-16:00. Can she go through to the gate already or will there be issues? 

If she gets an earlier flight before 16:00 to Copenhagen and then to Amsterdam, would it be okay or will she be stopped in Los Angeles? 

We need to know if she has to book another flight, which would also be much more expensive and she doesn't have that kind of money. Any help or guidance is greatly appreciated!

We wrote the airport who said we should contact the embassy and we also got through the airline telephone after trying for many hours, and he said we should also check with the embassy but that it should be fine (?).

Thank you!!!

1k5t9xq,reddit,Flying out from KIX - where to stay for last night?,"Hi there, 

I also posted this in a german sub but probably I get more replies here. I'm flying back from Kansai Airport on my next trip to Japan in July because it made the most sense in terms of price and logistics. I always book accommodation for the first and very last night of my vacation and am still a little undecided about where to go for the last night.

I definitely don't want to go to Osaka and certainly not to Kyoto. Instead, I'm looking for a very manageable (small town), ideally either pretty or interesting (historically, architecturally, ...) place with an acceptable (local express) train connection or bus connection to KIX Airport. I don't mind changing trains, I only have a small 40 liter backpack with me. I don't fly until late in the evening and would have the whole last day there on site. I won't have a bike by then either, I'll have got rid of it shortly beforehand, which means I'm comparatively less mobile.

I'm able to google, but maybe someone here has a tip for me from their own experience. ;) ",2025-04-23 07:28:10,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,2,3,,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k5t9xq/flying_out_from_kix_where_to_stay_for_last_night/,Disastrous-Grape-821

- SAFE area, would like to explore without having to stay in a tourist zone


Yes, I understand that the Caribbean in July/August isn't ideal weather wise but I'm willing to take our chances, but will consider an equally good east coast resort that doesn't cost a bajillion dollars. 


I have a travel agent that recommended Half Moon in Jamaica which fits most of these except the safety part. I hear good things about Aruba as well.

1k4hprp,reddit,Northern/Central Vietnam - 15 night itinerary - Couple - Mid 30s,"Hi,

I'm looking for some help with a 15 night itinerary, starting and ending in Hanoi, in May. I'm going with my wife for our honeymoon, so we're looking at things more on the luxury side of things as opposed to backpacker/solo travel which a lot of advice seems geared to.

In terms of things we enjoy, she enjoys the city and hussle and bustle, whereas I prefer to see more of the nature side of things - however neither of us is particularly adventurous! So doing something like the Ha Giang loop, which many people recommend, seems a bit of a stretch - neither of us ride motorbikes and some of the safety concerns seem a bit worrying to me! However we do want to avoid things which are super super touristy e.g manufactured purely for tourists and to sell you stuff

Places we've got on a short list to see so far are:

- Hanoi - 3 nights
- Lan Ha Bay cruise (maybe) - 2 nights
- Sapa (maybe) - 2 nights
- Ninh Binh - 1 (or 2) nights
- Hoi An - (? nights)
- Hue - (? nights)
- Da Nang (fly back to Hanoi)

I'm currently unsure about Sapa or the bay cruise - have read some mixed things about both in terms of how touristy they are.

My main concern with going to all these places is just how much time we'll spend travelling. We do still want to relax and have some time to spend in nice accomodation, as opposed to being on sleeper trains the whole time - but on the other hand most of the places don't necessarily seem like they have enough to do for more than a 3 night stay?

Would be great to get some advice on how to balance moving about constantly with staying put but not getting too bored!

Arrival & exit: Milan (28th May)- Rome (8th June)
Accommodation: Mix of Hotels and Airbnb

Verona 
28th-29th-30th-31st (4 nights)

I am making Verona as my base to explore. We want to visit all beautiful sights of Verona, enjoy food experience and simply soak in the north Italian charm.
Day trips we wish to do from Verona: Lake Garda, Padua
Day-1: Verona
Day-2: Lake Garda, Sirmione (Brescia it time permits)
Day-3: Padua, Vicenza
Day-4: Trento (or at leisure in Verona)

1st-2nd-3rd June (3 nights)

We want to enjoy Florence, but reading it to be tourist trap and expensive theme park; I’m unsure where to stay. Does it make sense to stay in Florence? Or we could base ourselves somewhere on outskirts?
Day-1: Florence
Day-2: Florence
Day-3: Pisa-Lucca-Florence

Pienza/Montepulciano/Grosseto/Sienna: 
4th-5th June (2 nights)

Will do one/two of above places. Undecided where to stay. But the region is so beautiful, I don’t want to miss it

Rome: 
6th-7th-8th

I think Rome will easily take 3 days to explore. We will add a day trip is possible to explore something around. Open to suggestions.

I really wish to do Naples with day trip to somewhere Sorrento/Ischia. But it looks very difficult unless I sacrifice day in Verona/Tuscany.

1k3yuo1,reddit,11 Day Peru Itinerary Advice,"Hey everyone! My wife and I are headed to Peru for an 11 day trip and would love some feedback/suggestions. We’re flying into Lima late on the first day and staying in the airport hotel. Then heading to Cusco early on Day 2. We want to see Machu Picchu, Sacred Valley, Cusco, and possibly Lake Humantay and Rainbow Mountain. We had originally thought to see another region in Peru as well but after some research it seems like this could cause us to be too rushed. We want to see a lot but dont want to constantly be on the move. 



Itinerary:

\* Day 1 – Arrive in Lima. Stay at airport hotel

\* Day 2 – Fly to Cusco (early AM), chill, explore, acclimate

\* Day 3 – Cusco day – explore San Blas, Qorikancha. Take it easy to continue acclimating. 

\* Day 4 – Sacred Valley day trip: Pisac, Ollantaytambo, Moray, Maras

\* Would it make more sense to stay in Ollantaytambo this night or head straight to Aguas Calientes?

\* Day 5–6/7 – Machu Picchu (ideally a 2-day, 1-night or 3-day, 2-night tour)

\* Having trouble picking a tour of Machu Pichu. It seems like there at 4D/3N and 2D/1N tours ( we’d love a 3D/2N lol). But confused as to how to get a mix of hiking + train which both seem really cool and unique. 

\* Day 7 – Return to Cusco

\* Day 8 – Day trip to Lake Humantay/Rainbow Mountain

\* Day 9 – Day trip to Lake Humantay/Rainbow Mountain 

\* Day 10 – Final full day in Cusco 

\* Day 11 – Fly from Cusco to Lima → fly home late that night



Questions:

\* Does this itinerary feel too rushed or too drawn out? Are we allowing enough rest and acclimation time? I'm especially concerned about the two day trips in a row. 

\* Anything I’,m completely missing?

\* Tour company recs?

\* I had a thought to stay in sacred valley but having trouble figuring out logistics as most tours seem to leave from Cusco. 

\- would another Peru region make sense or should we stick to this area?

\- Any hotel or general recs are appreciated!!

  
Thank You!!

1k379mx,reddit,How Do I Renew My Passport Without Pausing Monthly International Travel?,"Hey everyone! I'm looking for some advice on how to renew my U.S. passport without putting my regular international travel at risk.

My current passport expires in July 2025, and I’ve started researching the renewal process. From what I understand, whether you do it online or by mail, you have to send in your old passport and wait for the new one, which is tricky for me.

I fly to Canada for business 1–2 times a month, and I don’t have Global Entry or Nexus (yet). Even with expedited processing, I’m nervous about being without my passport for more than 2 weeks, especially if something unexpected delays the process. That’s a big risk for me work-wise.

Ideally, I’m looking for a way to renew while holding on to my current passport or minimizing the time I’m without it. I’m totally open to other ideas too, like getting Global Entry if that could help in any way, or going to a passport agency in person if that would be faster.

Would love to hear from anyone who's been in a similar situation or has tips for navigating this!

The weird thing is that when I search for that flight thru the airlines website, it doesn't show up. The seats weren't close to full so that wasn't the issue and you're still able to find and book the flight searching thru Kayak. It's a lufthansa flight.

1k2bwck,reddit,"Help us pick our last US trip together: PNW, Yellowstone, or Florida?","Hi everyone!

My friend and I are planning a one-week trip in mid-May and trying to choose between three very different travel options in the US. Each has its own appeal, but we’re having trouble deciding what would make for the most memorable and enjoyable experience—especially since this might be our last big trip together before she moves abroad.

Here are the options we’re considering:

Seattle + Portland (PNW) – We’re drawn to the vibe, food scene, nearby nature, and walkable neighborhoods. We’re not planning any hardcore hikes—just want to soak in the city energy, maybe visit some parks, and enjoy the coastal atmosphere.

Yellowstone and nearby areas – We’d have to join a tour since we don’t drive. It seems like a once-in-a-lifetime kind of place, but we’re unsure if May is a good time to visit, or if a group tour would feel rushed or exhausting.

Florida (Orlando + Miami) – The mix of theme parks and beaches is tempting, but we’re worried it might be too crowded or touristy in May. That said, it could also be a super fun and carefree choice.

A few notes about us:

We won’t be renting a car, so accessibility via public transport or tours is a big factor.
We like city exploring, scenic views, cultural spots, and some time in nature—but nothing too physically demanding.

Ideally, we’re hoping for something meaningful and low-stress, with minimal logistics to worry about.

Would love to hear your thoughts or experiences with any of these options—especially if you've done them without a car. Thanks in advance!

Update:
Just wanna add another option: San Francisco + Yosemite/or somewhere near SF

We are not considering driving since my friend was in a car accident a while ago and still feels uneasy about driving, and I don’t feel confident driving long distances in unfamiliar places either😢",2025-04-18 18:24:54,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,2,115,,0.52,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k2bwck/help_us_pick_our_last_us_trip_together_pnw/,Shoddy-Wait-5886

1k261ls,reddit,Overnight in Rome or Dublin with an afternoon flight,"I'm looking at some options for a company trip to Split, Croatia from PHL in September. The options I'm seeing on the return all (well, most) leave SPU too late in the day to connect through any of the westbound transatlantic hubs like LHR, FCO, or DUB on the same day, so they all have some level of overnight layover. I've been to London a bunch and would like to go somewhere I've not been.

The two options I'm looking at, one gets into Rome at 2200 on a Friday, and I'd fly out at 1310 Saturday. The other gets into Dublin at 1635 Saturday and I'd fly out 0930 Sunday.

So the Rome flight gets in late but also gives me time the next morning; the Dublin flight gets in earlier but is a pretty early flight out, and I'm kinda leaning away from that for that reason. Never having been to Rome, and only spending one day in Dublin decades ago, I'm not sure which airport is easier to get to/from the city center, nor what the cities are like either on a Saturday morning (Rome) or a Saturday night (Dublin). Can anyone provide some input about transit experiences in those cities?

If it helps in terms of policies, the airline would either be American or BA.

**Paris > Strasbourg > Lyon > Nice > Amsterdam** 

**📍Paris (2 nights)**

* Arriving from CDG, staying near Gare de l’Est
* Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, bakery hopping (La Maison Rose, Du Pain et des Idées, Carette)
* Walking Champs-Élysées, grabbing dinner near Saint-Émilion
* Not doing Louvre or Versailles — keeping it scenic and food-focused

**📍Strasbourg (3 nights)**

* Day trip to Colmar (return by train)
* Petite France, Place Kléber, local winstubs, cathedral
* Trying local bakeries and chill walks around the riverside
* Staying near the station

**📍Lyon (3 nights)**

* Bouchon dinner (Les Lyonnais), and another at Carmelo
* May do the 2-hour e-bike tour if the weather’s nice
* Exploring Vieux Lyon, traboules, Parc de la Tête d’Or, and checking out Presqu’île
* Staying fairly central

**📍Nice (3 nights)**

* Promenade des Anglais, flower market, beach strolls
* One day trip to Eze, plus a walk up to the Jardin Exotique
* Food will be light and local — socca, seafood, pastries

**📍Amsterdam (4 nights)**

* Exploring the city by tram and foot
* Anne Frank House, Keukenhof, and a half-day out to Zaandam + Zaanse Schans
* Cafés like Lanskroon, Fabel Friet, Winkel 43

1k0jd6v,reddit,Help me choose - Tanzania (2 options),"Hi all, I'm in the midst of planning a bucket list vacation for my husband and I to Tanzania in November 2026, combining time spent on safari with time spent relaxing on the beach in Zanzibar. I've narrowed down to two itineraries/quotes and am having trouble deciding between the two. They have many similarities - length of time, route, private guide/car the entire time on safari.  
  
Would love your takes and/or first-hand reviews of either operator or any of the accommodations. I'm particularly wondering if quote 1 is too good to be true?!

**Option 1 - Operator is Easy Travel Tanzania**

*Total Price:* $20,652 CAD

*Accommodations*: Lemala Ngorongoro Tented Camp, Lemala Nanyukie, Zuri Zanzibar 

*Pros*: LOVE all of the accommodations provided. Company seems to have very positive reviews online, is a member of TATO. Cheaper option.

*Cons*: Slightly less professional communications compared to other operator. Quote was a bit less clear - providing us with total price per person for the safari portion but then providing individual nightly cost for the Zanzibar portion. Also quoting based on 2025 rates, noting that the lodges haven't yet released 2026 but we can hold at 2025 rates for now and pay the difference later. Is this normal? 

*Other notes:* Local company based in Tanzania and specialized focus on this nation.  


**Option 2 - Operator is Vaya Adventures** 

*Total Price:* $24,575 CAD  
*Accommodations*: Lemala Ngorongoro Tented Camp, Serengeti Acacia Bliss, Zuri Zanzibar 

*Pros*: Still very much into all accommodations provided, only difference between the two itineraries is the Serengeti location. Company seems to have very positive reviews online. Communication has been impeccable, very clear and professional information sharing. 

*Cons*: More expensive, don't like the Serengeti location as much as the Lamala Nanyukie in option 1. 

*Other notes:* Not local to Tanzania but work with local operators/guides. Company does not solely specialize in safari/Tanzania although this is a main focus area. They seem to offer luxury travel primarily in Africa & South America. Does include more note of stops throughout the trip and guided visits to villages, Stone Town while in Zanzibar etc.",2025-04-16 12:37:35,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,2,22,,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k0jd6v/help_me_choose_tanzania_2_options/,mmeast

We are going to be in Germany the week before so we are taking the train from Munich to Zurich on 5/30. First time visitors and open to anything - a bit of hikes (not too intensive though). Looking for advice or any additional recs for the following rough itinerary - thank you!

Travel wise, planning to look on the SBB app - looks like it might be better for us to the saver day pass and half fare card instead of the Swiss Travel Pass.

5/30 Zurich 

* Arrive in early afternoon
* Explore western old town, Lindenhof, walk around the lake 
* Lindt chocolate museum 
* Kunsthaus Zürich

5/31 - 6/3 Lauterbrunnen - Grindelwald - Lake Brienz (with Wengen as base)

Avoiding Interlaken as base after reading through reviews (though yes it is convenient as a travel hub) 

5/31 Lauterbrunnen

* Hike in the valley and visit the Trümmelbach Falls, Staubbach Falls, Weisse Lutschine, take the cable car up to Murren
* If time allows, go up to Schilthorn as well 

6/1 Grindelwald

* Mannlichen Royal Walk
* Mannlichen to Kleine Scheidegg hike
* Grindelwald First 
* Anything else we should do?

6/2 Lake Brienz

* Giessbach Falls 
* Brienzer Rothorn - Cogweel train for the scenic ride
* Gelmerbahn
* Harder Kulm back in Interlaken
* Debated between Lake Brienz or Lake Oeschinensee but Lake Brienz is more convenient. Half of us are leaving that day so figured Lake Brienz is better. Appreciate any advice here! 

6/3 Lucerne

* Explore old town, museums and take a boat tour

6/4 Lucerne

* Lake Lucerne to Vitznau via boat, then cogwheel train up to Rigi, and cable car down 

6/5 Bern

6/6 Geneva (day trip to Montreux)

* Prefer checking out Montruex vs. staying in Geneva 
* Lavaux Vineyard, Lake Geneva

6/7 Geneva to NYC

I was hoping to maximize time spent over there and wanted to leave early Monday morning(12am-3am) though this may be a bad idea as I would have to return to work on Wednesday.

I have a work travel planned for mid June to Cape Town. I'll be probably staying at a hotel in center Cape Town, arriving on a Wednesday. Even tho I will be busy until Saturday, I'd like to know what I can explore of the city during Saturday and Sunday (and perhaps on an evening after work).

I've read about Victoria & Alfred Waterfront, Bo-Kaap, Green Point, Sea Point and Table Mountain. I'll be traveling with a co-worker (both females) and would like to get the most out of those 2 days.

What do you recommend that is close to the center, easy to get to and somewhat affordable?

Also, I've read about Loashedding, does that happens a lot?

What do you recommend for money, cash? credit card? what about cell phone cards?

Is there any close to center place I can visit on Wednesday from 5PM till night time? (also, what is night time there?)

1jzg9la,reddit,Sardinia vs Albanian Riviera: which one to choose for an 12-day trip in June,"In early June I'll travel with my parents to Italy (14 days) and we'll end the trip in Sardinia (4 days). We'll flight to Cagliari, drive to Villasimius and sleep there. In the next day we'll drive to Santa Maria Navarrese or Cala Gonone and stay in the nearest beaches. Then, we'll do a boat trip through Orosei Gulf (I'm thinking about doing a hike to a secluded beach like Cala Goloritzé, meet the boat there and continue the day with them). They still need to buy the flight back to Rome to leave Italy so the last day depends on that (ie if we have to go to Olbia then we need to plan for an itinerary that we'll be different than if they flight back from Alghero or Cagliari).

I'll be in Europe for 12 extra days and during 5 of those days I'll have to work remotely, starting at 2pm - which means that I have the mornings to explore. I'm very doubtful if I stay in Sardine or if I visit somewhere else like Albanian Riviera.

In Sardinia, I'd visit other beaches in the Orosei like Cala Luna, Cala Sisine, Cala Mariolu and some other hikes like Pedra Longa trail and Passo Ghenna Silana → Gorropu Canyon. I could continue going North and although I haven't researched much, everyone says it's even prettier than Gulf of Orosei, which I already found absolutely astonishing from the pictures I saw.

In Albania Riviera, I'd most likely stay in Himarë. Using it as a base, I could explore the nearby beaches: Filikuri, Jale, Qeparo, Celestina, Livadhi, Aquarium, Gjipe, etc. Hike to Porto Palermo, Himara Castle, etc. Could also visit Gjirokastër for a day trip or even stay a couple days. I could even go south at the end of my trip, get a boat to Corfu, stay one or two days there and flight back to Milan.

In a nutshell, Sardinia seems more beautiful and more expensive. Albanian Riviera overall costs are appealing to me even if the nature is not in the same league as Sardinia's. I'm very curious to taste Albanian food and I think I'll get bored with Italian food. Sardinia's hikes look more challenging, which means I'd need my hiking boots - which sounds like downside if I want to travel light.

Please, help me decide! Are my assumptions correct? Am there any aspects I'm not considering?",2025-04-15 01:56:21,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,2,3,,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jzg9la/sardinia_vs_albanian_riviera_which_one_to_choose/,MuriloScarpa

1jyoce8,reddit,Travel insurance options for trip w/ multiple stops,"I'm planning on taking a trip mixed with remote work for around a month or so. Due to some personal stuff I might need shift the exact dates last minute or (hopefully not) cancel it. I'd be in multiple cities/countries and might not buy the return leg flight on the same airline as I would be in a different city upon making the return leg. 

  
What are some good travel insurance options for this kind of situation? Do people just use the trip insurance offered by airlines at checkout? If I want to cancel or reschedule, I guess it might not be a ""covered cancellation"" option as I don't think ""this trip doesn't fit my schedule"" counts as a covered reason. 

  
Also- what are some options for insurance for things like flight cancellations or delays?  I never really bought insurance in the past, as I was young and just bought the cheapest tickets and if something didn't work out, just toughed it out. But have had some crazy experiences in the past that I'd like to hedge against now.

Nice (4 days)
Day trips to Cannes, Monaco, maybe Saint Tropez

Lyon (4 days)
Would love suggestions for cool day trips 

Strasbourg (3 days)
Day trip to Colmar

And from Strasbourg, I'll go back to Paris for my return flight.

1jyjsdm,reddit,Menorca or Costa Brava (or Costa del Sol)?,"Hello! My wife and I are trying to decide on a place to stay in Spain in the second half of May. We are looking for a good beach spot specifically. Last year we were on the Greek island of MIlos for the seaside part of our trip, where we were spoiled for beaches. We would like to stay somewhere similar in terms of quality of beaches and water.

This year we are trying to decide between Costa Brava or Menorca. Costa de Sol is also a consideration, but seems underwhelming compared to the other two locations. But, if you have it, we would love to hear evidence to the contrary. 

So for us the major things to consider are: temperature (both daily and water temps in late May), quality of beaches and surrounding landscapes, and a relaxed and local feel to the place we’ll stay. Food is also very important, and the possibility of nice hikes and walks are very welcome.

We will be there for about eight days in the second half of May. If we go with Costa Brava, with its higher latitude, would the water feel much colder than Menorca, enough to prevent us from considering it? Aside from the beaches, it seems that Costa Brava has a host of wonderful small towns from which to choose. While Menorca offers more beaches, and more of a getaway from everything.

Below my summary, suggestions/tips & tricks are welcome!

  
**Day 1 --> 3 (3 nights) : Isla Mujeres**

* We want to start off with a couple of days on the beach and really take our rest. Hoblox was our first choice but ultimately decided on Mujeres because it's close to the airport and no immediate need for a rental car/taking a bus.

**Day 4 --> 6 (3 nights) : Valladolid**

* Visiting the town
* Ek Balam
* Cenotes (like Chichikan/ Xchanche

**Day 7 --> 10 (4 nights): Merida**

* First day: from Valladolid to Merida: do Chichen Itza on our way. If we have time also Izamal in the late afternoob
* Visiting the city
* Progresso, (my girlfriend loves raccoons and wants to visit Reserva Ecológica El Corchito
* Cenotes at Homun (Cenote Santa Bárbara)
* Celestun maybe, but Flamingos are already gone??

**Day 10 --> 12 (3 nights): Bacalar**

* First day: from Merida to Uxmal, afternoon a 5hr drive to Bacalar
* Spend time at the lagoon
* Boat tour at Canal de los Piratas
* Rapidos not really worth it?

**Day 12 --> 14 (3 nights): Coba/Tulum**

* Found a hotel between Coba and Tulum which is so much cheaper than a hotel right in Tulum
* Coba ruins
* Snorkeling at Akumal
* Cenotes/beach days",2025-04-11 10:07:36,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,2,4,,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jwmarx/2_weeks_in_yucatan_my_itinerary/,Laulaufuego

I’m looking for some advice for our Turkey trip this May/June. It’ll be my parents, my husband, and me — and it’s our first time visiting Turkey!

We’ll be there for 22 days (21 nights) and plan to rent a car. I decided to skip Cappadocia this time since it’s easy to fly there later, and we don’t want to spend too much time driving on this trip.

Here’s the first draft of our itinerary: I have about 17 nights planned so far. For the remaining 4 nights, I’m thinking of adding extra nights to a few places to make the trip less rushed and more enjoyable.



|location|hotel nights|
|:-|:-|
|Istanbul|4|
|iznik||
|Bursa|2|
|Bergama||
|Kusadasi|1|
|Denizli|1|
|Fethiye|2|
|Antalya|2|
|Isparta|1|
|Afyonkarahisar|1|
|Kutahya|1|



Some ideas I have:

* Add 1 more night each to Denizli, Kuşadası, Isparta, and Afyonkarahisar. **or**
* Add 1 more night each to Kuşadası, Fethiye, Antalya, and Isparta.
* Or what would you suggest?

1jtvqoi,reddit,Planning a trip to California to visit Yosemite/Sequoia and then to Monterey Bay for whale watching. I have no idea what I'm doing.,"Wife and I have never been west of the Mississippi River, and when we last planned a trip out West, it was cancelled due to us having a baby. We are now planning a trip to California for our 10 year anniversary in three years with our then-to-be 8 year old daughter. 

The rough-rough draft of our vacation plan is to fly into Fresno, head East to Monterey for a few days to whale watch, explore, and get some beach time in, and then head back to Fresno where we will then commute each day to either Yosemite or Sequoia National Parks. 

So, I have a few questions:

1. Is there a better place between Yosemite and Sequoia National Parks to stay? We chose Fresno due to the airport and reasonable distance between the two parks.
2. Is there a better bay-town, whale-watching area that is close by?
3. Would this trip be too much for an 8 year old?
4. Are any areas of the parks closed in mid-late April?
5. Does $6k seem doable for this trip over 9 or 10 days? We will lodge affordably, but comfortably, and eat fairly cheap. This price is being based on the hopes that our economy recovers by then.

I also welcome any travel tips or information pertaining to the areas we will be traveling to, as well as suggestions for other things to do while we're in the area. I think we plan on spending 9 or 10 days total, and we don't get many opportunities to do a trip like this, so that's why we're trying to cram so much in, while hopefully not taking away from each place. 

That's all I think! Thanks for any help.",2025-04-07 20:41:27,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,2,5,,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jtvqoi/planning_a_trip_to_california_to_visit/,Calfkiller

1jsyacm,reddit,Can someone either talk me into or out of this proposed itinerary? (Advice: Madrid/Granada),"Hello all. 

I am looking at a few options for travel later in the year (specifically November, although it doesn't have to be this month) and I was looking at Granada to see Alhambra. November is ideal for me based on my work schedule and also having mild weather for the region at that time of year. 

However, I see that there looks to only be one flight in to Granada each day, connecting from Madrid. I know that Malaga airport exists as well and is relatively close by, although getting to Granada would be another headache that I wouldn't want to deal with after a long transcontinental flight (I am from the US) and a connecting flight, and language barrier (my Spanish is okay, but I don't feel confident about it enough to really trust it-- I would also be doing this solo, which compounds my fears a little bit too) which would always stress me out. So, seeing as how I am not particularly comfortable about this, my alternate thinking would be to fly into Madrid and treat it as a long layover in a sense (I've always wanted to see Madrid too, but this would obviously not be doing it justice, which is another concern of mine-- would I be doing it just to check off a box, you know?) 

The flights I am currently looking into would land in Madrid at around 8:00 or 10:00 local time. I figure that would give me enough time to see at least most of the key sights in the city at a leisurely enough pace (I am mainly only really interested in the Royal Palace-- however not going in for a tour or anything like that-- and Parque del Retiro if I only had less than a day) as well as doing some self-guided walking tours, etc. 

That being the case, I would spend the night in Madrid and then take a train the next day to Granada and stay there for a few days, seeing the main sights of the city on arrival day, Alhambra the next day, and then a hike in the Sierra Nevada the next day. The tricky bit that I am wondering about is whether it is worth it to train back to Madrid and spend another day there before I depart back to the US or potentially fly back out of Granada (I think this would be more expensive). I would just be stressed about that because with only one flight out of Granada a day, if I missed it, I would be screwed. 

Basically, I am wondering if it would be a waste of time (and money, hotels in Madrid for these two nights would be more than what I have estimated my whole time in Granada to cost, for instance) to follow the below schedule: 

Nov. 21 -- Land in Madrid, see a few sights, etc. 

Nov 22-25 -- Train to Granada. Checking out of hotel on 11/25 and getting the train back to Madrid on that date. 

Nov 25 -- Back in Madrid and fly out the next day -- I would probably stay somewhere close to the airport just out of my own paranoia and so I can rest easy knowing I can get to the airport quickly and stress less about it on a tighter schedule (the return flight would be at around 10:00 in the morning). 

I am planning on doing something similar when I go to Ireland in a couple of months, where I'll be landing in Dublin, moving partway through to Belfast, and then returning the final day of the trip to go back to Dublin/airport area rather than trying to make a more complicated journey to the airport on the date of the return flight (I am a very nervous person in case you couldn't tell). Any information or advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you!

TL;DR -- Would you spend less than a day in Madrid before going off to Granada or would you try connecting from Madrid-- either to Malaga or Granada proper?

1jsb6j9,reddit,"Portugal + Spain itinerary, is there any location you think I should spend more time on?","I will be going to Portugal and Spain for 1 month. Except the days where I will go to excursions, I will be **working in the morning and traveling in the afternoon.**

Could you please check whether my itinerary makes sense, and if there are any locations you think deserve more time?

I come from Asia, so my strategy is to **see the most things possible**, since it's not often I can go to Europe. **Working is relaxing enough for me**. 

I enjoy architecture, history, landscapes and food. I am interested in the Muslim history of Spain.

I have been to Madrid and Barcelona before, and they are out of the route, so I won't go to those places.

**Questions:**

1. Is Coimbra worth 1 day or even a stay? I checked the images on Google, and it seems it's not very unique compared to the other Portuguese cities in my itinerary

2. Is Malaga worth 3 days? Its main appeal seems to be Muslim castles and the beaches. There are Muslim relics and beaches in the other cities

3. Would you recommend a day trip from Tarifa to Tangier? Neither Tarifa and Tangier seem to have many attractions, so the main reason to go there would be to experience crossing the Gibraltar Strait. However, I also saw that Tangier is full of scammers. I've been to Egypt and I ignored the scammers, but would you say Morocco's scammers are worse than Egypt's?",2025-04-05 19:15:43,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,2,10,,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jsb6j9/portugal_spain_itinerary_is_there_any_location/,anbeegod
1js95vi,reddit,Trip Report: 8 days Solo-Travel in Florida from the UK,"**Summary:**

I solo travelled for 8 days (from the UK):

* 5 days in Orlando, within Disney World accommodation
* 3 days in Miami in South Beach (originally going to be 4 but left a day early)

*I caught a cold the day before my flight to Florida, so I shoved down medicine/cough suppressants every day but I ended up leaving Miami a day early, partly because of that and partly because I felt I was still jet lagged.*

  
**Itinerary:**

**Day 0** \- Arrived in evening in Orlando

**Day 1**: Kennedy Space Centre Day

This was pretty amazing - they have great tours within the key attractions. I found 1 day was sufficient to tick off the big name attractions, the Saturn V exhibit and the Atlantis Exhibit. Like others have said these were both awesome and worth seeing.

**Day 2**: Disney World Magic Kingdom  
**Day 3**: Disney World Hollywood Studios  
**Day 4**: Disney World Animal Kingdom  
**Day 5**: Disney World Epcot

**Day 6:** Took Brightline Train to Miami and stayed in South Beach area

**Day 7:** General exploring, hanging out on beach, going to Little Havana

**Day 8:** Ended up taking an early flight home this evening

  
**General comments about Orlando:**

My Orlando leg was centred around Disney World, and so I picked accommodation in Disney World to avoid having to travel into Disney World repeatedly. This turned out to be a pretty good decision.

I'd definitely recommend this as you can fairly easily get in and out of Disney World with Ubers or with a rented car.



**General comments about Disney World Accomodation:**

I stayed at All Star Movies Resort which along with the other All Stars is fairly budget compared to other hotels. 

Overall impression:

* The food is not great but if you're only there to have breakfast and are eating out otherwise then it's fine. I couldn't imagine having more than 1 meal a day here.
* Transportation is great - they have quite frequent (every 15 to 30 mins) shuttle buses to each of the major parks
* Have basic amenities, such as shops with medicine, quick food supplies, hats etc...
* My one criticism off this place is the level of sound you can hear from neighbours can be a lot, particularly when you have a young family next door which you probably will! Partly because of this, I struggled to get a decent sleep which really didn't help... I probably wouldn't stay here again because of this.

**General comments about Disney World Parks:**

I'm in my 30s so I wasn't sure how I'd find Disney World, but I had a really positive experience. I'm not a massive rollercoaster person so the rides at Disney were for the most part a good balance between being scary/exciting and being approachable and more fun for someone who isn't into crazy rides.

Favourite rides: The seven dwarfs, Pirates of the Carribean, Haunted Mansion (all in magic kingdom).

In addition to the rides, the parks do musical events, parades, and other events which are really nostalgic.

Favourite attraction/event: Fantasmic in Hollywood Studios. This and the Magic Kingdom fireworks evening show do such a great job of making all these invented world and characters come alive and making you part of it.

IMO this was the highlight of my Orlando leg.

  
**General comments about Miami:**

Quite expensive in comparison to similar places in London. I found it easy to be spending almost 100 dollars on a meal.

South Beach is quite walkable, but in comparison the rest of Miami is not really walkable.



**General comments about Florida**

**Transportation**

I always forget when I come to the USA how much more car oriented the cities are. Even in Miami which had some walkable areas (e.g. South Beach), the streets feel much less friendly to pedestrians versus a European city.

When I stayed in All Star Movies in Disney World, I saw there was a streak restaurant about 15 mins walk away in principle, but there was literally no way you could walk there because of the way the surrounding area is built (e.g. due to having to cross dual carriageways with no pedestrian crossings or no sidewalks).

I did research transportation options and decided Uber would be my primary mode of getting around (e.g. from Disney World accomodation to Kennedy Space Centre, and getting around Miami, and to and from airports). Overall this was fairly cost effective and much less hassle than trying to rent a car when I don't drive at all in London. I'd definitely recommend this for others.

On getting from Orlando to Miami, there is a train called the Brightline which is in general much better than what most US states. This is a very cost effective way of getting from North to South Florida so again would recommend this (paid about 70 dollars for a ticket, 3.5 hours travel time).  


**Weather**

I travelled from late march to early april (after postponing my original trip planned in October 2024) and the weather was great (high 20s Celcius) and not too humid.

I'd definitely recommend planning your Florida trip to avoid the more humid months or hurricane risky months which you can research online.



**Other Comments:**

As I said I caught a cold the day before my flight and it wasn't so bad that I felt the need to cancel completely. I powered through but it did still make it tough to enjoy the trip as much, particularly in Miami.

The flights in particular are brutal with a cold - not only do you feel the normal dehydrating and potential nausea but you can get the painful pressure effect on your ears and forehead due to being congested during ascent and descent. 

I recommend having at least 1/3 litre of water to drink before ascent and before descent to ease the congestion as well as the usual decongestants - the water basically gets rid of any potential pain.



**Overall:**

Travelling in the USA is always interesting and different. I've used to London urban planning and have been to Italy/Spain/Greece/France/Thailand/Japan and overall I find it much more comfortable and easy to navigate in the pedestrianised and public transport heavy cities like Rome or Tokyo.

Walking around parts of Miami in particular it just feels sort of soul less some times with the lack of people on the streets as everyone is in cars. Again, just my personal experience.

  
Would definitely go again to Miami to have a more exciting trip, doing more water activities, hopefully without being congested and jetlagged next time!",2025-04-05 17:48:46,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,2,2,,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1js95vi/trip_report_8_days_solotravel_in_florida_from_the/,Ok-Bug8833
1js8ixr,reddit,Portugal & Spain in May/June,"Like the title, I am traveling to Portugal and Spain from mid-May to mid-June. Looking for some tips especially for the Spain portion. This trip opportunity came spur of the moment and my brain is feeling fried trying to decide what to see!
Any thoughts/tips are greatly appreciated.
Below is not so much an itinerary as much as it is a list of ideas.

I’m interested in soaking up as much culture as I can. Art, architecture, food, beaches and hiking. I enjoy live music, nightlife & dancing but I don’t drink anymore so the party scene isn’t a focus necessarily.  


I fly into Porto and have 10 days to get to Lisbon.
I thought about doing a 2-3 day portion of the Camino de Santiago but in the opposite direction (towards Lisbon) and wonder if it will be “worth it”? 
Coimbra comes highly suggested and once in Lisbon I’d like to do a day trip to Sintra.
This keeps me pretty inland so if there are other towns/villages you suggest to see or something along the coast that is a must please let me know!

Once in Lisbon I fly to the Azores for 1 week for a retreat so this portion is already planned out.

When back in Lisbon in late May I then have 2+ weeks to do Spain. I don’t have a return flight yet so one thought is I could boogie from Lisbon up to San Sebastián > Barcelona > Andalucía > back to Lisbon for return flight
OR Lisbon > Andalucía > Barcelona > San Sebastián > Madrid or Porto for return flight

I’d like to see Andalucía - Seville, Córdoba, Granada, and Malaga all get recommended - how do I decide?? Is Gribaltar worth getting to?
San Sebastián & Barcelona are both on my list. 
Madrid I’ve heard mixed reviews about. Many say it is a must but some say they preferred Barcelona so maybe it can be skipped? It’s a nice halfway point from Andalucía though so it could be easily done, I’m sure. 
Are there any towns less traveled that I’m missing out on?

1js4dgv,reddit,Bus (ABE) to EWR for international flight to HND help,"Hi! 

I am flying out of ABE to Japan and the route requires we take a bus from ABE to Newark prior to flying out. For whatever reason, the ticket was $400 cheaper per person if we took the bus, rather than just the same route going out of Newark. Apparently, they really want people to ride their bus.

  
The question is, should I still get to ABE \~3 hours early for an international flight? Or would this not be needed because Newark is the international portion, and it would be okay to get there \~2 hours in advance? ABE is a smaller airport and it's normally quick relative to the larger airports. It is a 6 AM bus time so being able to get a little more sleep would be great if we can.

1jrsynp,reddit,Grand Canyon or Yosemite??,"Grand Canyon or Yosemite??

A few things to consider when reading:
We will be going early October, maybe sooner depending on what you all say about the weather (but I chose early October in hopes that it will not be too hot or too cold at either place, whichever is decided).
We do plan on swimming at a few rivers and waterfalls at either place. 
Rental car costs are not a factor because my friend who is going with will be picking us up. 
We do love the outdoors and camping, but we will be training a lot over the next 6 months to make sure we are in good shape for either trip.  
I am including a rough itinerary and financial plan for both choices just to help out a little. 

Now that all of that is out of the way, I am struggling so damn hard and NEED all y'alls help!!!! 

Just a small backstory to get things rolling: I went to the Grand Canyon a couple years back, I rented a bike and rode along the rim to Hermits Rest and back, it was so fucking awesome. I also drove out to Hoover Dam and Alamo, NV to see Area 51. It was such an amazing trip. 

Current Day: My bf and I are planning a trip to go back out West in October and we invited a really good friend of ours to tag along, he lives out there and he offered to drive us so we could avoid paying for a rental car. The original plan was to make the same trip as I did a few years back, plus my bf and friend have never seen any of those sights I visited, so that would make it even better. BUT, this time I want to hike down to the Colorado River and camp for a few nights. I also wanted to camp at Havasu, but the cost is just not in my budget as of right now. I do plan on making a trip back to the Grand Canyon, hopefully in the next couple of years to camp on the Havasupai Reservation though. Realizing that we wouldn't be able to do Havasu this time around, I got super bummed and my friend (who is going with us) then suggested Yosemite, neither I or my bf have visited Yosemite, but my friend has and he loved it. However, they both told me that it is up for me to decide since it'll be a birthday trip, but both places are insanely beautiful just from photos, but the Grand Canyon has my heart lol. 

The cost of doing the Grand Canyon trip will cost roughly $1200 - $1700 including flights, hotels, souvenirs, etc.
The cost of Yosemite will be around the same maybe a bit less because we won't be spending any on hotels or restaurant food, we will just be camping the whole week in Yosemite. 

With these two options, which would you choose and why?
Again, we do want to swim and possibly fish, so if you have been to either park in late September/early October, how was the water?

I'm going to Peru in the fall for 14 days, and I have a bad habit of overestimating how much I can do in a day. I'm hoping to get some opinions on my itinerary so I can go at a much more reasonable and less frantic pace.

I have to mention that I sit at a desk all day, so when I go on vacation, I walk a lot (ex., 30k steps a day). I'm not a lay-on-the-beach vacationer; I just don't want to overwhelm myself with too much sightseeing per day. Does that make sense?

Day 1–3: Land in Lima, Fly to Cusco

Day 4: Rainbow Mountain

Day 5-7: Explore Sacred Valley on the way to Ollantaytambo

Day 8–11: Inca Trail, Return to Cusco

Day 12: Another small day hike??

Day 13–14: Fly back to Lima, explore Lima

Day 15: Fly home in the morning

At some point, I thought I could squeeze in Arequipa and the Colca Canyon, but I felt I was overdoing it.

1jpy2b8,reddit,Help planning a trip to Italy!,"Itinerary


Hi! I’m planning a solo trip for 2.5 weeks to Italy August 25th to September 11 starting in Rome. I have a rough Itinerary of cites i want to visit but open to any suggestions.

A little bit about me and my  interests -- this is my first time in Italy so I’d love to hit some of the major tourist attractions while I’m here ie Pisa, Colosseum, Duomo, Lake Como, etc.

Im a huge foody! This is one of the main reasons for my trip. Definitely looking for unique and authentic restaurants or street vendors that aren't too tourist trappy. I’d love to eat like the locals do. My price point is flexible, I’d like to keep it around $$ but could sneak in a few $$$$/michelin star experiences if highly recommended.

As much as i love the city, i also really enjoy being outdoors, historical sites, museums,in the countryside, or on a beach somewhere. I’m thinking that we'll stay in the cities as our home base and travel around the nearby area if i want to do any hiking, wine trips, coastal beach towns etc. I definitely want to see Lake Como and potentially go out to see the Dolomites. Is this a good strategy?

As for domestic travel, to bounce between city to city, i was thinking of purchasing a Eurail One Country Pass for Italy. Is this worth it or should i consider another form of travel? Also, not sure if this pass includes sleeper trains and I’d like really like to save daylight by leveraging sleeper trains to get from one place to another.

Lastly, for accommodations, I was thinking of using AirBnB or hotels for the entire stay across the country.

This is my itinerary at the moment

Flying landing into Rome on the 25th (5 nights)
Amalfi Coast (4 nights)
With a day drip to Pompeii
Florence (2-3 nights)
Venice (2-3 nights)

1jpuwim,reddit,France planning help - Riviera or Provence?,"Hi all! 

My husband and I are currently planning a one-week trip to France towards the end of June. We are going to split our time between Paris and then are really struggling to pick the second destination, but are thinking of either doing Provence or Eze in the Riviera. 

I would LOVE some feedback from this group about which option to choose... 

We really love exploring historical sites and museums, visiting beautiful towns, drinking good wine + food, hiking and relaxing on the beach. So both options are obviously very appealing!  

Our concerns for both are - 

Provence: we're concerned it could be too sleepy? we're young and enjoy going out (but also we aren't trying to go clubbing lol) 

Riviera: we're worried it'll be crawling with tourists in a way that feels very unenjoyable and it's also just a very expensive place to be! we are not dead set on staying in eze either, all of the towns in the area seem gorgeous. 

Thank you in advance for any help you could provide!!

* **Location:** Malliouhana seems to win based on location in Meads Bay. When people say taxis are expensive, how expensive are we talking? Rough estimate - how much would a taxi cost from Zemi to Meads Bay for dinner? 
* **Beaches:** I've read mixed reviews - for those who have been to both Meads Bay and Shoal Bay, which beach do you prefer?

* Do some day hiking in the Drakensberg (South Africa side)
* Head back to Johannesburg

Is it safe to do this itinerary? Ie Some people seem to recommend to fly directly to Kruger park...

Also, is it okay to hike in the Drakensberg without a group (just the two of us)?

Just to be clear: I have medicines prescribed by U.S doctors that I need for travel. I have the prescriptions, the original containers, and letters from doctors explaining what the medicines are for. I shouldn't need to submit documents for certificate, right?

1joke4f,reddit,This might be the first time I'm traveling without camping gear! So excited for my Italy/Dolomiti trip + questions,"Detailed itinerary below but the second half of our 2 and a half weeks trip will be dedicated to hiking the Alta via 1. End of July/early August. My SO and I learned that we were supposed to book our rifugios in January...at about the time we were starting to look at rifugios bookings 😅 By some miracle, I swear, we finally managed to book all of our rifugios this weekend except 2, we'll keep looking. Couldn't find anything the weekend before that. I'm super duper grateful, otherwise it would have been complicated to do this hike. I'm so excited to not have to carry around an enormous backpack in the scorching sun, and eat boring shelf stable food every night, for once!!!! (I adore camping, but we do a lot of that already, we were totally in for a light-carry hiking trip) 

I will have a few questions on different subjects at the end, if you can help me out with the few things I still struggle to figure out! 

And as usual I'm always open and looking for your amazing recommendations on spots we shouldn't miss out :) 

We are landing in Rome in the morning and that first day we might not do much or at least we gave ourselves a ""chilling"" day just in case. Probs for browsing around the cafes and restaurants. Second day Coloseum, Crypts/catacombs. 
Third day we bus to Naples to visit Pompei, and Herculanum if we find the time.
We spend the night in Naples and the next day we're going for a day trip to Capri island for sightseeing, walking around and check out the Garden of Augustus. And some beach time too. Ferry lin the evening of this fourth day and back to Naples. 

From Naples we will take the train in the morning of day 5 to Florence. Spend the night and most of the next day there, but we'll be taking a train in the PM to reach Venice around dinner. We have a looooovely airbnb right on the island of Venice, little terrace with a view, can you even believe it was less expensive than the hostel we were first going for in Mestre !! Two nights booked in Venice, visiting days 7 and most of 8. 

Day 8 is still a bit blurry as we are waiting for a rifugio to become available at the very first stop on our Dolomiti hike ; either we find one and therefore leave Venice late in the day to spend the night in Belluno, or we might start the hike a day after and instead do a huge stretch to reach our first booked rifugio in a single day (about 10hours from trail head) 😬
Anyway, if all goes according to plan, on day 9 we should begin 

~Alta via 1 of the Dolomiti~
We're doing it backwards from Belluno ! It's what made the most sense for us. 

We are hiking for day 9 (working on Bianchet/Pian de Fontana/Pramperet still..) , 10 (to Carestiato), 11 (Coldai), 12 (Passo Stolanza), 13 (still working on Passo Giau..) ,14 (Dibona) and on day 15th we'll most likely have to do a biiiiig stretch from Rif Dibona (close to the road to Cortina D'ampezzo, near/before? Lagazuoi) to rif Pederu in a single day (10hrs?), to catch a night bus going to Rome (at least we hope to find one!) 
This is because we are really at the end of our trip and are coming short on time, flying from Rome to home in Canada (not without a layover, of course! Shrugs at my partner's attempt to save 100 ish bucks) in early afternoon on day 17th. 

So we unfortunately won't be hiking the last little stretch to Braies, but I think it will be more than enough to amaze us! I'm honestly jumping around just thinking about this adventure.

But if I may inquire to anyone who would happen to know...
1- We accidentally booked only a single bed / spot in Carestiato, when we thought it was available for 2! I booked it anyway and we really need that spot, nothing else  around...from experience do you think it will be fine if we show up and if there are no more beds, we ask to sleep in the same bed?(we're both very lean so not the best but better than the floor lol) Most importantly, will both of us get dinner , or is everything calculated tightly? 

2-I've never driven outside of my country(province, actually), a bit nervous to do so. But if I were to rent a car let's say near rifugio Pederu, or in Cortina D'ampezzo, can I drive to Rome and..leave it there? How do these things work? Would it be crazy expensive? Or even almost dangerous for that route length if I'm inexperienced with European roads? 

3- please let me know about your favorite local-owned and low key/mooost authentic restaurants in Rome, Naples, Florences
 and Venice ! As well as little known spots easy to miss out on that we can add to our bucket list. We don't have a big food budget at this point, but we could indulge on something more fancy for one or two nights out of the trip, though. And we love more rustic spots too.

We were planning on doing stops at least in las vegas and bryce/zion parks.

Do you consider the itinerary feasible/reasonable? After Yellowstone, which airport would be best for a flight back to Europe? I was thinking maybe Denver or Seattle, but both of them seem to be really far away from Yellowstone. 

And last, do you consider this a good trip for foreign tourists in the US? I went to New York a few years ago, but I assume this is quite different.

Edit:

Thanks for all the advice! We didn't want to eliminate SF (we are already sacrificing things we liked, like Yosemite), but taking a flight from SF to LV is something we hadn't considered and it saves us a day. We are already looking into it.

Also, it looks like SLC is well conected, and being a bigger airport will probably lower the fee for leaving the car in a different airport. Besides, the ~5 hour drive from Yellowstone to SLC would be acceptable.

Our beaches you just park somewhere and walk up to it so that’s my only experience but I’m not looking to go to your typical beaches I guess you could say. It seems like the majority of the beaches I’d like to see are on the north shore in Minnesota and then what you see of the beaches from Chicago.


The friend going with me is not really able to do more than maybe 1/4-1/2 mile of hiking terrain so that’s mainly why I’m trying to figure out what is easier to see, because some of the stuff I look up I find out it’s an actual hike to some of those views.

I’m planning a 4–5 day mom -daughter trip to Paris with my 13-year-old daughter. It’ll be just the two of us, and I’d love advice on our itinerary and where to stay that’s safe, walkable, and close to main sights.

We’re considering either late May/early June or July—any thoughts on which is better?

Here’s what we’d like to do:
	•	Arc de Triomphe & Champs-Élysées
	•	Place de la Concorde
	•	Sainte-Chapelle
	•	Louvre or Musée d’Orsay
	•	Les Catacombes
	•	Seine river cruise

We’re mid-range travelers (not budget but not luxury either). Also wondering:
	•	Are there safe and convenient areas or hotels you’d recommend for families?
	•	Is it realistic to add a 2-day side trip to Amsterdam? We have a friend there we could stay with.

Thanks in advance—we’re excited but want to plan this right!

1jo5nah,reddit,One week in Oaxaca City - how to split time/potential day trips?,"
Hoping to get some advice on an upcoming week-long trip to Oaxaca in May. My husband and I are well-seasoned travelers excited to visit Oaxaca City for the markets, culture, art, and energy. We love exploring cities and are very happy to not have every minute of each day scheduled - we love to wander and Oaxaca seems like an amazing place for this pace of travel.

However, we have 7 nights and I’m wondering if this will be too much time in the city. I’d love to visit the beaches on the Pacific coast but I’m wary of losing two days to travel on such a short trip. I also don’t want to feel rushed during our time in the city. The general consensus among travelers asking the same questions is that a week is definitely not too long to explore the city and surrounding areas - do folks here agree? And if so, what are some potential day trips/surrounding areas to explore that don’t require a group tour? We are open to private guides but generally don’t enjoy group excursions. Is it advisable/safe to rent a car for a day or two to explore on our own?

1jo2eyh,reddit,Lost Luggage in Europe: How Does Compensation Work?,"Hello everyone!

I am Brazilian and just returned from a trip to Europe, but I had an issue with one of my checked bags.

On my last flight within Europe (Milan > Barcelona) with easyJet, one of my bags was lost. Still at Barcelona Airport (BCN), I spoke with easyJet and the airport staff, who searched for the bag but could not find it.

As a result, I filled out the Property Irregularity Report and am now waiting for updates from easyJet.

It has been six days, and I have not received any response (email or phone call).

I am not sure how it works in Europe, but in Brazil, I have experienced lost luggage before, and here, it is possible to take legal action and receive compensation for the inconvenience.

I had to spend the last three days of my trip wearing the same clothes. From what I researched, I could have bought clothes, and easyJet would have reimbursed me, but since it was the end of my trip, I didn’t have the chance. I arrived in Barcelona at night and was leaving for Brazil the next morning. When I arrived in São Paulo also at night, I only stayed at a hotel to sleep because I had another flight to my city early the next day, leaving no time to buy clothes.

So, I would like to understand how this works in Europe. From my research, most cases mention reimbursement for expenses due to lost luggage, but I haven’t seen anything about compensation for the loss of the bag itself.

Regarding travel insurance, I purchased one, and from what I’ve seen, I have to wait 21 days before I can file a claim for the lost bag.",2025-03-31 12:50:20,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,2,6,,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jo2eyh/lost_luggage_in_europe_how_does_compensation_work/,Individual-Cut3998

In October (2nd half), I am planning to visit the US for the first time with my wife. Our first destination is LA (as we have some friends living there), the holiday lasts about 14 days (+- a few days if needed).

However, whenever we have a long-haul flight, I have a good experience with breaking it up and adding an extra stop (number of days TBD).

Therefore, I am considering making a stop somewhere in the eastern part of the US.

I am a big fan of Halloween and everything spooky. I was considering a stop in Boston and travelling to Salem, but the internet research showed that it gets overcrowded at that time of the year.

Another consideration is New York (they say the city is beautiful in Autumn) and also visiting Sleepy Hollow, but it too is likely to have way too many visitors during that season.

Any good advice on a stop idea? Maybe somewhere where it's not that crowded. Anything: haunted houses, amusement parks, etc

I am also interested in nature, country music, food, movie history (but guess, LA could cover that).",2025-03-30 20:19:53,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,2,7,,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jnlkol/itinerary_advice_flying_from_europe_to_la_around/,Local_Challenge_1698

Edinburgh for 2-3 nights.

Inverness for 2 nights followed by a day in Isle of Skye (haven't many options to stay on the Isle so may have to do it in a day)

1jnhaoh,reddit,Planning Madagascar in May – Fly to Morondava for Baobabs & Tsingy or full road trip? + Route feedback?,"Hi everyone! 👋  
My girlfriend and I are planning a 3-week trip to Madagascar in **May 2025**, and we’d love your input – especially from locals or travelers who’ve done similar trips. We're planning to rent a **car with a driver**, and are also looking for **recommendations for reliable drivers or agencies**.

# Our trip:

* **Arrival in Antananarivo:** May 1
* **Departure:** May 24 at 14:30 from Tana

# Flights already booked:

* **May 9:** Tana → Île Sainte-Marie (09:00 AM)
* **May 13:** Île Sainte-Marie → Tana → Nosy Be (arrival \~14:00)
* **May 22** ***or*** **23 (still deciding):** Nosy Be → Tana (arrival \~23:00)

# Option 1: Fly to Morondava (May 3–8)

We’re thinking about flying to **Morondava on May 3** to visit:

* 🌳 **Baobab Avenue** (top priority!)
* 🏞️ **Tsingy de Bemaraha** (also a must for us)

We’d return to **Tana on May 8** and stay overnight for our Sainte-Marie flight the next morning.  
**May 1–2** would be used for a visit to **Andasibe National Park**, including a **night walk in the rainforest**.

# Option 2: Full Road Trip (May 1–8, no domestic flights)

Instead of flying, we’d do a **complete road trip by car with a driver**.  
This route is based on the places we’d love to see – but we’re unsure what’s realistically possible and would **really appreciate your honest feedback** or route adjustments!

# Wishlist (flexible):

* **Andasibe** (rainforest, night walk)
* **Ranomafana**
* **Isalo**
* **Baobab Avenue (Morondava)**
* (*Optional:* **Antsirabe**, if time allows)
* Tsingy probably wouldn’t fit in this version – and that’s okay

# Our current draft itinerary for Option 2:

|**Date**|**Route**|**Notes**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**May 1**|Tana → Andasibe|Afternoon: arrive & night walk |
|**May 2**|Andasibe → Ranomafana|Long drive day|
|**May 3**|Ranomafana NP|Full day hike|
|**May 4**|Ranomafana → Isalo|Long drive|
|**May 5**|Isalo NP|Hike & relax|
|**May 6**|Isalo → Morondava|Long drive|
|**May 7**|Baobab Avenue|Sunset 🌅|
|**May 8**|Morondava → Tana|Long drive |

We’re worried this **might be too rushed** – what do you think?  
Is it realistic or should we drop something? We want to **enjoy the experience**, not just check off places.

# Our open questions:

1. Is it **worth flying to Morondava just for Baobabs & Tsingy**, or would we miss out on more diverse nature experiences?
2. Is **Tsingy accessible in early May**, or still too muddy/slow?
3. Does **Option 2 seem realistic**, or too exhausting? What would you cut or change?
4. Would you include **Antsirabe** if time allows – or skip it entirely?
5. Are there **trusted agencies or driver recommendations** for a 7–8 day trip like this?
6. Is it risky to drive **back to Tana on May 8**, the day before our Sainte-Marie flight (May 9 at 09:00)?
7. We’re still deciding whether to fly back from Nosy Be on **May 22 or 23** (both arrive \~11 PM) – would you prioritize **more time on Nosy Be or more margin in Tana** before the international flight?

# After May 9:

* **May 9–13:** Île Sainte-Marie – flexible, no plans yet
* **May 13–23:** Nosy Be – relaxing, possibly diving and island hopping
* **May 22 or 23:** Back to Tana for final night(s)

Thanks so much for reading and for any thoughts or advice – we really want to make the most of this trip without burning out!

Does Jetblue still give snacks?

1jmo877,reddit,Tourist Visa singapore - uk citizen,"Hi there - 

  
As a UK citizen I could previously enter Singapore for 90 days for tourism, without VISA, has this changed recently?

  
I can see on the gov uk website:

# Visa requirements

You can visit Singapore without a visa for tourism or business. The [Immigration and Checkpoints Authority](https://www.ica.gov.sg/) decides who can enter Singapore and how long they can stay. The period of stay permitted is at the discretion of the immigration officer. It is normally between 14 and 30 days for British citizens.

  
But nowhere else

  
Any clarification would be appreciated

1jmnnen,reddit,Uzbekistan & Kyrgyzstan Itinerary - Tour Questions for Kyrg,"Planning a trip to Uzbekistan & Kyrgyzstan in late April/early May (wish it was later to do some serious hiking in Kyrg, but these are the dates we have). We are very into history, but slightly more-so into nature and outdoor experiences. 

My questions:

1. Should we attribute more time to Uzbekistan? 

2. Should we hire a driver/set tour for Kyrgyzstan? We have **never**  done a long multi-day tour like this, but am hesitant to rent my own vehicle and drive over mountain passes with it not being summer. Also hesitant to do a 14 day tour in case we don't love our guide, company, etc. so was going to break it up into a couple different tours. 

3. Any must-see cities/experiences we're missing in either country? 

Planning on this itinerary for Uzbekistan:

4/15 - 4/18 = Samarkand

4/18 - 4/20 = Bukhara

4/20 - 4/22 = Khiva

4/22 - 4/24 = Tashkent

Tentative itinerary for Kyrgyzstan

4/24 - 4/26 = Bishkek (day trip to Ala-Archa National Park) 

4/26 - 5/3 = 7 day tour that includes Chon-Kemin National Park, Kilemche shepherd home, Issyk-Kul lake, Karakol, Altyn Arashan Hot Springs

1jmn6rz,reddit,Advice on Chile Trip Itenerary,"Hi everyone:

I was hoping for some advice on a Chile trip itinerary. We arrive 7 am May 15 and leave 8 pm May 25 so basically 9 full days and 2 half days. Based on your comments we have decided to drop TDP (not enough time and not enough daylight time, weather) and have decided to focus on Rapa Nui and Atacama this trip (hoping there will be more in the future). Here is the tentative itinerary.

Day 1, 15th: Land in SCL 7 am, relax, see some of the city later on in the day

Day 2, 16th fly to Calama CJC Leave SCL 9 am, reach CJC 1130 am

Stay 16, 17, 18 nights Atacama area so 2 full days

Day 5, 19th fly back to SCL, leave CJC 10 am, reach SCL 1230 pm, spend time in Santiago pm

Day 6 20th fly to Rapa Nui IPC, leave SCL 11 am, reach IPC 230 pm

Stay 20, 21, 22, 23 nights on Rapa Nui so 3 full days

Day 10, 24th fly to Santiago, leave IPC at 230 pm, reach SCL at 9 pm

Day 11, 25th, spend am to early pm in Santiago, leave SCL at 8 pm for return

We had wanted to do to Inca lagoon but that would require one full extra day. Would anyone advise shortening one day in Atacama or Easter Island to make that happen? Or is it not worth it?

Also, what are recommended must-sees that we should fit into our itinerary?",2025-03-29 14:14:23,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,2,0,,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jmn6rz/advice_on_chile_trip_itenerary/,Mindless_Station505

1jm6thk,reddit,Thinking of going to Aruba! Any thoughts or other Caribbean recs?,"Hey y’all! So I (29M) had surgery about three weeks ago, and I’m doing fine now. My surgeon cleared me to travel, swim, soak in water, all that good stuff. I’m off work for the next two months, so I really want to get away and just leave LA for a bit and chill somewhere different.

I’ve been thinking about the Caribbean. For some context, I’ve been to a few islands before. My boyfriend (25M) though has never traveled internationally. He’s been to Hawaii and loved it, especially the food, but he’s not really a swimming in the beach kind of person. I’m not much of a swimmer either, but I love being near the ocean: waking up, sitting under a palapa, sipping a drink, watching the sunrise and sunset, waves in the background. That kind of vibe.

I’m basically still recovering, so I’m looking for something really relaxing. Not super active or busy. Just sun, quiet, and nice scenery.

A little background: I’ve traveled to over 50 countries, mostly in the Middle East and Africa. So while I’m not new to travel at all, the Caribbean isn’t somewhere I’ve explored as much. The last time I went was about two years ago, so planning a beach trip like this honestly feels a little rusty for me. I’m kind of re-diving into it, and realizing that planning a Caribbean trip is a whole different mindset.

Places I’ve been and liked:
- Turks and Caicos: Loved it. White sand, clear water, super chill hotel-focused vacation.
- Roatán: Also amazing. Beautiful beaches, great food, amazing snorkeling culture fun nightlife.
- Puerto Rico: Amazing food, but it felt a bit too much like Miami with the crowd and social scene.
- Bahamas: Not really my vibe. It felt very party-heavy and packed. But, full disclosure, I stayed in Nassau.
- Colombia (Caribbean side): Cool to visit, but again, very catered to tourists.

We were thinking about Belize at first, but from what I’ve seen online, the beach scene didn’t seem as relaxing or picturesque as I expected. Where are the sands?? lol

Now we’re looking at Aruba. It seems promising with lots of hotel options along the strip, great and beautiful beaches, access to good food, and it looks pretty easy to get around. We’re planning to rent a car, but it also looks super walkable near Eagle and Palm Beach, which I like. I don’t like being stuck in a hotel the whole time, so having things nearby is a plus.

Just wondering if anyone here has thoughts on Aruba or other suggestions for Caribbean destinations that are chill, beautiful, and not super crowded, but still accessible enough for someone like my partner who’s never left the country before.

We’re planning to go in the next month or so. Appreciate any input!

1jm43g8,reddit,Lake Atitlan where to stay for 2 women in their 30s,"Hey All! 

I have been down the rabbit hole on here and trip advisor and I can’t seem to nail down the best place for us. So I figured I would just ask directly with a little more info and see if someone can help. 

My friend and I are going to Lake Atitlan at the end of the month. We are both in our mid-30s. So our parting days are behind us, but we will enjoy a couple drinks after dinner. And likely call it a night around 10ish. 

We are only spending 3 days so we want to pick one area to stay and stick with it as our home base. 

Originally we thought for just 3 days, perhaps panajachel, but we think it will be too touristy and busy. We are seasoned travelers and like to avoid main tourist hubs for more than maybe half a day. 

The more we read we thought San Pedro may fit the bill then. We still want to be able to walk around and get water taxis to other places easily. But about every hotel review has a bunch of reviews saying something along the lines of “the music from the bars outside was so loud and unbearable.” And as we no longer party, this concerns us. 

Santa Cruz seems the most up our alley as far as the hotels and quieter/simpler and a bit more in nature, but it seems maybe a bit too quiet. Everything I’ve read seems to agree, if it’s your first time and want to walk around at all or pop around to other areas, this isn’t the place for you. Seems everyone who stays in Santa Cruz just stays there and relaxes. 

Can someone give me some insight if you’re around my age and have similar taste? Thank you in advance !!",2025-03-28 19:58:58,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,2,14,,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jm43g8/lake_atitlan_where_to_stay_for_2_women_in_their/,mka1809

Some background: My wife and I (early 30s, not avid hikers but can do light and short 2-3h+ trails with little elevation. I love wine, she doesn't drink. we love food!) went on our honeymoon to NZ last April-May and are so enamoured of the country that we are already planning a trip back this late November - early December, specially to see the lupins (yes, I know they are an invasive weed). Perhaps also cover some easy tracks that were closed last time out.

On last year's trip, we covered in the South: Queenstown, Te Anau, Milford Sound, Wanaka, Hawea, Mount Cook, Tekapo and Christchurch. We are not averse to seeing the same stuff (hence Mackenzie Basin again for the lupins), but are open to new things as well.

May I please ask for you to provide feedback on my itinerary below and any recommendations. 

Day 1: Land in Chch, overnight Chch.

Day 2: Drive to Hokitika via Arthur's Pass. Overnight Hokitika

Day 3: Explore around Hokitika - Pancake Rocks, Truman Track, Hokitika Gorge etc.

Day 4: Hokitka to Franz Josef / Fox Glacier.

Day 5: Glaciers

Day 6: Glaciers to Wanaka

Day 7: Wanaka - Rob Roy Glacier Track - please be open this time! Lavender Farm.

\*Day 8: Wanaka to Mount Cook

Day 9: Mount Cook - Kea Point, maybe explore some other tracks apart from Hooker Valley

Day 10: Mount Cook to Tekapo

Day 11: Tekapo - Mount John

Day 12: Tekapo to Christchurch, return car and fly home



\*I have one major dilemma as it stands - should I take an extra 3 days, starting from Day 8, to go from Wanaka -> 1N at Owaka/Curio Bay (\~4h) -> 2N at Dunedin (\~2h drive) -> Mount Cook (\~3.5h), to have a chance at exploring part of the south east (and hopefully spot some seals and sea lions) as well?

How exactly does luggage forwarding work in Japan?

My wife and I will each have one large suitcase. During our trip, there will be two occasions when we want to explore the city in the morning/afternoon before traveling to our next destination later in the day. By that time, we will have already checked out and, of course, don’t want to carry around two large suitcases.

Specifically, this will happen once when traveling from Okayama to Kobe, as we plan to stop in Himeji to visit the castle. So, we’ll take the Shinkansen in the morning, stop in Himeji, and arrive in Kobe in the evening to check in at our Airbnb.

The second instance will be when traveling from Kyoto to Osaka. We want to explore Kyoto in the morning/afternoon and then travel to Osaka later in the day to check into our Airbnb.

Is it possible to send the suitcases in the morning (from Okayama and Kyoto) and pick them up at the station in the evening (Kobe and Osaka)? Or are they delivered directly to the accommodation?

Since we're staying in an Airbnb, there won’t be anyone available to receive the luggage.

I am wondering if anyone has done the 1 day tour (3 days total with travel). So one to arrive to the airport in Labuan Bajo, 1 day for the tour and 1 day to return.

1. Day 1: Arrive at Labuan Bajo Airport (sleep for the night, maybe see the beach and ask about prices for tours.. not sure where but assume ""downtown""/center).
2. Day 2: get up early around maybe 6-7am? Find a single-day tour that leaves 9am\~?

Be on the boat for 3hours to Komodo Island?

1-3 hour hiking?

3) Get back for another 3 hours on boat

4) fly out next day on 3rd day.

Mostly curious about 1) duration of boat ride 2) duration of the activities 3) timing of when the tours leave in the morning and come back 4) pricing

1k79cau,reddit,Pre-existing condition travel insurance?,"So my mom (senior), daughter, and I are heading to the UK this Sunday (from Canada) and had purchased travel insurance when we booked the flights. But my mom has a few new medical issues and the policy won't cover them. I am trying to find insurance that will cover these new, pre-existing conditions but have run into a few roadblocks.

She had a doctor's appointment yesterday, and he switched her antibiotics, so the condition (which is not serious) is considered unstable, so they can't offer coverage. On top of that, Holter monitor results from March 11 are still not available, so since diagnosis is pending for this separate issue, she is ineligible for coverage for all conditions.

Does anyone know of any coverage options/insurance providers for a pre-existing, unstable condition and a medical test pending results? I am waiting to hear back on high-risk coverage options.

My husband and I love food and wine, exploring and walking everywhere, taking in the culture, and we don’t do museums 😊

Day 1: land Lisbon
Day 2: Lisbon
Day 3: Lisbon
Day 4: day trip to Sintra
Day 5: pick up car, drive to Coimbra early
Day 6: Coimbra, drive to Douro Valley later in day
Day 7: private tour to visit Quintas, eat, cruise along the river (would love any recommendations for this!)

Is that too many days in Porto? Anything I should change? Originally I was thinking 2 nights in Coimbra but not sure that’s really needed, plus the full day there would probably fall on a Sunday and I read that a lot of restaurants are closed that day. So we would just be poking around and then heading to the valley. I thought we would rather have an extra full day in Porto. Thanks for any input!

1k70acy,reddit,Solo PhD Break Adventure: New Zealand Rough Sketch – Feedback Wanted!,"Heyyoo,  

I’m planning a 12 day solo trip to New Zealand from Christchurch to Auckland after my first year of a US PhD and would love your feedback on timing, must-see spots, and especially your favorite campsites (Google pins or maps welcome!). I have a campervan that is stocked im renting. I am supposed to start in one city and end in the other. I’m big into trail running, climbing, and Māori culture—so if you’d drop or add anything for those, let me know!

Here’s my rough itinerary:

Christchurch to Lake Tekapo/Mt Cook  
- Drive: 3 hours  
- Stay: 3 nights  
- Explore Lake Tekapo, Lake Pukaki, day trip to Mount Cook for hiking.

Lake Tekapo to Abel Tasman (via Kaikoura or Nelson NP)  
- Drive: 8–9 hours (split over 2 days)  
- Day 1: Tekapo to Kaikoura (5–6 hours), overnight in Kaikoura  
- Day 2: Kaikoura to Abel Tasman (3 hours)  
- Stay: 3–4 nights  
- Hike, chill on beaches, explore Abel Tasman.

Abel Tasman to Picton (Ferry Terminal)  
- Drive: 2–3 hours  
- Ferry to Wellington: 3.5 hours  
- Stay: 1 night in Wellington.

Wellington to Taranaki (New Plymouth)  
- Drive: 4.5 hours  
- Stay: 3 nights  
- Hike Mt Taranaki (Pouakai Crossing or Circuit), Pukekura Park, coastal walkway, local art.

Taranaki to Tongariro National Park  
- Drive: 3–3.5 hours  
- Stay: 2 nights  
- Hike Tongariro Alpine Crossing.

Tongariro to Hobbiton (or skip to Auckland)  
- Drive: 2.5–3 hours  
- Book Hobbiton tour.

Hobbiton to Auckland (Airport or city)  
- Drive: 2 hours  
- Stay final night near Auckland/airport.

Food tips welcome too! I’m excited to try local specialties if you recommend. Any favorite spots or hidden gems for these or other must-try Kiwi foods? Also keen on quick, tasty road trip eats and local treats to fuel my adventures.

Also, I want to deeply connect with Māori culture and spirituality, especially their relationship with nature. I’m fascinated by stories of Kupe and want to learn about concepts like kaitiakitanga (guardianship), mauri (life force), wairua (spirit), mana (spiritual power), and tapu (sacredness). If you know good cultural tours, guided hikes, or places where I can respectfully experience Māori stories, rituals, or spiritual sites, please share! I’m eager to understand how Māori see humans as part of the natural world, not separate from it, and how this shapes their environmental stewardship.

Questions for you:  
- Is this timing realistic for an active traveler?  
- What are your best campsites or hut stays along this route? Please share Google pins!  
- If you love ultra running, climbing, or extreme sports, what would you drop or add?  
- Any “don’t miss” day hikes, trail runs, or adventure activities beyond what’s listed?  
- Favorite local foods or eateries to hit up on the way?  
- Recommendations for authentic Māori cultural experiences or spiritual sites?

Some things I’m considering:  
- More time in Queenstown/Wanaka for adventure sports? (worth the detour?)  
- Ultra/trail running in Rotorua or Tongariro? (Tarawera Ultra, Tongariro Northern Circuit)

Maybe renting a car and drive to Innsbruck on the first day and start from far West while ending the trip in Vienna? Maybe last couple of days with public transport in Vienna should be ok I think. Not sure about the other places. What about the trains? Maybe it's not even worth to rent out a car?

1k6wf02,reddit,10 Days in Colorado,"Hi, Looking for some hiking/adventure/stay recommendations for an upcoming trip to Denver and the surrounding area. 

Why I'm Posting: Hoping for some direction and recommendations from people familiar with the Front Range. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by the sheer amount of possibilities for hikes & outdoor adventures and trying to determine what may or may not be accessible in early May, as it looks like some of the scenic roads or access to trailheads won't reopen for the season until June. 

Background: My girlfriend and I are traveling from Philadelphia for a concert (Turnover) at Red Rocks on Friday (5/2) and staying in RiNo until Sunday morning to explore the city a bit (we're all set on recommendations for Denver). We plan to leave Denver on Sunday morning for a day trip to Golden or Colorado Springs, then spend Monday - Wednesday morning working remotely from Boulder, and then take the remainder of the week off to stay somewhere further into the mountains to hike and look for other fun things to do. 

Sunday Night -> Wednesday Morning - Remote work from Boulder on East Coast hours. We picked Boulder because we assumed we'd have easy and reliable access to wifi and cell service needed for work but can almost immediately be on trails by 4pm each day that we can complete before dark. Have been recommended Royal Arch, Mount Sanitas, Chautauqua Park, Flatirons.

Wednesday -> Saturday Morning - This is where we need the most help! We're wondering what would be the best mountain town to stay in thats less than 2 hours from Denver and would have access to hikes and scenic drives that are accessible this time of year. She's really into trains and wants to do an ATV tour, so any guidance on that would be great too! Based on what we've read online, we've heard Nederland, Black Hawk, or Idaho Springs could be good options for an AirBnB. 

About Us: We are in our 30s, fairly experienced with hiking in the Northeast/New England but won't have snowshoes/spikes and she really isn't into hiking in snow much deeper than typical hiking boots can handle. We head back to the airport on Saturday 5/10. We'll have a rental truck/SUV with 4WD/AWD (not sure what model we'll end up with). I've been to Denver for a bachelor party but this will be her first time.

We are looking for advice on how to proceed with delayed luggage after a flight with Hainan Airlines.
Me and my Girlfriend recently took a flight from Tokio to México City.

Tokyo-Beijing-Tijuana- México City
(April 14 HU440-HU7925)

One of our backpacks did not arrive at México City with our Flight.
On saturday April 19 our luggage appeared to have arrived in MÉX.
Over the last week we tried to get Hainan Airlines to deliver our luggage to our final destination which is Queretaro.
They denied all our request by saying:

>We understand that your baggage did not arrive with you on the same flight, and you had to pick it up yourself
 >in Mexico. We apologize for any inconvenience caused this issue. After contacting the Beijing airport, we were informed that your baggage did not >arrive due to security checks at the Beijing airport. As this situation is beyond our control is not the responsibility
 >of the airline, we regret to inform you that we are unable to deliver your baggage to the address you have specified. We hope you understand this >situation. Once again, we apologize for any inconvenience caused by this matter.

We did not have to recheck our bags in Beijing as the Tokyo-Beijing Flight was also done by Hainan Airlines.
We think that it is the Airlines responsibility to make sure our luggage reaches is after a delay that is beyond MY control.
Going there to pick the luggage up myself would cost me a mínimum of 7 hours traveltime and ~50$.

Every other airline I ever has this happen with (Lufthansa,KLM) did not hesitate to transfer my luggage to my destination even if its >3hrs away from the AirPort. I got it lates 2-3 days after the flight.
As Hainan Airlines does not have an official Office in México, we can not go after them with PROFECO (their Words)
I am a european citizen, I was also the one that bought the tickets. I bought the tickets while I was in Korea tho.
Can I pressure them with European Consumer Protection? 

I really dont wanna make the journey and lose a day as I am pretty busy, but I also dont want to lose my luggage.

Any advice that some of you can give?

1k640zx,reddit,🌍 Seeking Advice: B1/B2 Visa Interview After ESTA Denial — Dutch Citizen with Afghan Background,"
I’d really appreciate any insights or advice you can share based on your experience. Here’s my situation:

I applied for a B1/B2 visa in May 2023 at the U.S. Embassy in Amsterdam. At the time, I was a permanent resident of the Netherlands and held an Afghan passport. Unfortunately, my visa was denied under Section 214(b).

In December 2023, I became a Dutch citizen and received my Dutch passport. In March 2025, I applied for ESTA — but after five days of pending status, it was denied. I was then advised to apply for a B1/B2 visa again and attend an in-person interview.

I’m now preparing for that process — gathering all the required documents and mentally getting ready for the interview. For context:
	
•	My entire immediate family (parents and siblings) lives in the U.S.
	
•	I have documentation of my father’s cancer diagnosis, and one of my primary reasons for travel is to visit and spend time with him.
	
•	I live in the Netherlands with my husband (also Dutch, Afghan-born) and our three children, all born here.
	
•	This trip is strictly for personal/family reasons — I have no intention to overstay or violate visa terms.

If anyone here has had a similar experience (ESTA denial followed by a B1/B2 application), especially with a background like mine, I’d be really grateful to hear your insights:
	
•	What kinds of questions did they ask you during the interview?
	
•	What supporting documents did you bring?
	
•	Any tips to strengthen my case or avoid common mistakes?

1k627fk,reddit,"Advice for 14 Day Itinerary in Sicily, Italy","Hi everyone! My girlfriend and I are planning a 14-day road trip in Sicily and would love some itinerary advice. We want to visit some nice spots across the island but would like to minimize driving time and especially avoid changing bases too often (max 4 bases ideally).

We’re flying in and out of Palermo, and we'll have a rental car for the whole trip.

We love sightseeing, cute towns, beaches, food, and some cultural/historical sites. Here are the 4 main areas/places we’re hoping to include:

* North: Palermo & Cefalù
* West: Taormina (Etna hike)
* South: Siracusa, Ortigia, Noto, Marzamemi
* East: Trapani & Erice

We’d love some help figuring out:

* The best 3–4 base towns to stay in (so we don’t move every night)
* Smart routing to reduce backtracking and long drive days
* Whether any of these spots make better day trips from a base
* General tips or places you think could be skipped or are “musts”

Would really appreciate any insight from people who’ve done a similar loop or have local knowledge 🙏

I want to book my plane tickets soon since they’re currently cheaper, but I’m hesitant because I don’t have the visa yet. Do you think it’s better to go ahead and buy the tickets without the 30-day visa and just apply later, or should I apply for the 1-year visa now to be safe?

So I have a flight booked next Tuesday:

- Madrid back home: plane leaves at 12:45PM, usually boarding closes at 12:30. (With Air Canada)

I don’t want to take the shuttle bus because I don’t want to go through security again. I wanted to know can we walk from T4 to T1?

I’m planning a trip to Indonesia in July with my girlfriend and looking for some suggestions. I’ve heard Bali can get pretty hectic and expensive around that time, so we’re hoping to find somewhere a bit more laid-back — but still with good infrastructure and plenty to do.

Ideally, we’re after a spot that has:

* Local food and markets
* Chill beaches
* Mangrove tours, caves, snorkeling, or boat trips
* Some surf if the conditions are right
* Safe and relaxed environment for a young couple
* And just an overall good vibe — not super rural, but definitely not Kuta-style crowds either

Maybe what I’m describing *is* Bali, but if there are any other towns or islands you’d recommend that offer this kind of mix, we’d really appreciate the suggestions.

1k5oo9i,reddit,Seeking advice on trip with gf to west coast USA during June,"Apologies if this isn't formatted correctly for this subreddit. First real Reddit post. Please bear with me.  
  
Over the past few years, my girlfriend and I have been fortunate enough to do quite a bit of travel independently, be it for work, or for visiting family, or friends we haven't seen in a while. We haven't done much travel together, however, and have been waiting for a good moment to do a proper trip together for a change.

We both need to be in California this summer for a wedding (mid-june, near SFO), so we're thinking this is a perfect chance to make a trip out of it. We're spinning out though, as neither of us have spent much time on the west coast at all, and there's too many places to see that we just can't put together a coherent itinerary.

We both have our eyes on Seattle as a potential place to move, and have some friends there that we can stay with for a few days, so we're basing our trip off the assumption that we'll either start or end there.

But we're stuck idling - we want to see the Redwood forests, and Napa, and the beaches south of San Fran, and the Oregon coastline, and Portland, and Mt. Rainier, and the islands just west of Seattle, and Yosemite. Can't possibly do all of that, and I'm sure we're just touching the surface. Also there's Vancouver. Thing is too - it seems that we'll definitely need a car for much of the above, and that's fine, but I don't think we want to go full road-trip, instead focusing on quality time spent in a handful (or even just two) places. We'd love to do as much as we can, but we'd also like to have at least a period of 3 days where we stay still and relax. Something that piqued our interest was the mention of an Amtrak line from SFO > SEA here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/ukfrs4/anyone\_have\_a\_west\_coast\_itinerary\_washington/](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/ukfrs4/anyone_have_a_west_coast_itinerary_washington/)

Could anyone point us in the right direction? Should we go north or south from San Fran? Should we consider multi-city flights, and road trip between the source/destinations? I have seen the post linked in the FAQ on a road trip between san fran to seattle (https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/rr6za/seattle\_to\_san\_francisco\_coastal\_road\_trip/), but it is 13 years old and assume it is quite dated, and as previously stated, we may not be equipped to commit to a full-on road trip.

Is it even really practical to try to do more than stay in SFO for a few extra days, then fly to Seattle for a few others?

Some ideas we've had:

1. SFO > Redwood > Portland > Seattle > home
   1. Fly to SFO for wedding and rent a car
   2. Stay 2-3 nights in Napa or Sonoma or somewhere else nearby (relax time)
   3. Drive up 5 hrs to Redwood and stay a night
   4. Drive up from there to Portland for another night or two
   5. Drive up to Seattle and spend 4-5 days in city
   6. Fly Seattle > home
2. SFO > Seattle > home
   1. Fly to SFO for wedding
   2. Leave immediately post-wedding and go to Seattle
   3. Stay with friends in city for a few days
   4. Ferry to San Juan islands and stay at a lodge for a couple days (relax time)
3. San Luis Bispo > SFO >Seattle > home
   1. Fly to San Luis Bispo and travel to beach-y places like Cambria and Big Sur, Monterey, etc
   2. Realizing California is a big place... Stopping list here.

rrrrrgggg. Planning not my strong suit.

Budget between the two of us is no higher than $5k if possible.

Lots of great suggestions on staying in seattle in a comment here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/4u95mo/destination\_of\_the\_week\_usa\_west\_coastpacific/](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/4u95mo/destination_of_the_week_usa_west_coastpacific/)

Online i can see its says it covers medically necessary health care (as defined below) but can't tell if this would be included under the pre-existing sections. If anyone has any ideas on this and/or where i could get this treated out there it would be much appreciated. Also if this is not covered and you have an idea on how much this would cost please let me know.

Medically necessary healthcare is defined as treatment that cannot reasonably wait until you return home. This includes: 
Emergency treatment and visits to A&E. 
Treatment for long-term or pre-existing medical conditions. 
Routine medical care for pre-existing conditions that need monitoring 
Routine maternity care (as long as you are not going abroad to give birth). Oxygen therapy and kidney dialysis (though some treatments may need pre-arranging).

1k4u1bn,reddit,Need help planning 1-2 nights in Switzerland from Milan — overwhelmed with options!,"Need help planning 1-2 nights in Switzerland from Milan — overwhelmed with options!


Hi everyone!

I’ve thoroughly confused myself trying to plan a quick Switzerland trip and would love some help. I’ll be traveling with my parents (all adults, ages 25–55) from Australia — it’s our first time in Europe.

We’ll be leaving from Milan on either May 26 or 27 (flexible depending on what works best), and I want to spend 1, maybe 2 nights in Switzerland.

Originally, I was really keen on Grindelwald for the cable cars and the toboggan experience. But transport from Milan + accommodation in Grindelwald is turning out to be quite expensive.

I then looked at staying in Zurich instead, but the train journey is still pricey, and I feel like we might miss the classic mountain experience.

I also considered renting a car (my dad’s a confident driver), but I’m unsure how easy it is to drive and park in Grindelwald or other villages in the Jungfrau region.

Then I came across the Bernina Express, which looks amazing for scenic views — but then we’d miss out on the cable cars and alpine village feel.

To make things more confusing, I just listened to a podcast that mentioned lots of lesser-known villages in the Jungfrau region also have cable cars and scenic train access, and may be more peaceful (and maybe more affordable?). They suggested staying in Lauterbrunnen and taking cable cars, trains and/or busses to the nearby villages.

At this point, I’m just overwhelmed! We want a scenic Swiss experience, something iconic with a cable car or mountain view, ideally without breaking the bank. Would love any advice — suggested routes, places to stay, or even if it’s better to do something totally different!

I have an overseas flight from Paris ORLY to the States at 11:30AM on June 5. I need to get from Nice to Paris, and I’ve looked at trains, flights, and buses, and I’m conflicted about what to do. 

Flight: Easyjet 6:30 —> 8:00 AM. This is what I’m leaning towards because it takes me directly to the same airport. 3.5 hours should be enough time since I’m not checking in any bags. 

Train+bus: there’s a train+bus option that departs at 5pm the previous day and arrives at ORLY at 5:30AM June 5. Since it’s overnight, it can save me one night’s accommodation. However, I’m a little hesitant about changing from train to bus in the middle of the night, and I’m a young solo female traveler too. I also have a long international flight ahead, so I’m not thrilled about having a 24+ hour travel day.

Train: Or should I be extra cautious, get to Paris the previous day at 9PM and book accommodations? I don’t love this option because I’m pretty much wasting a day, and I’ll need to spend more on accommodations. 

So again, I’m leaning towards flying with Easyjet. Does anyone have experience with Easyjet? From my quick search, they do seem pretty reliable, and it’s an early flight. I’m just worried delays might happen.

3. Between Masai Mara and Serengeti, which destination would be more budget-friendly overall (including flights, decent accommodation, and game drives)?


4. Any recommendations for reliable budget tour operators or agents who can help plan the trip?


P.s:- its during my anniversary and is kind of a surprise for my wife.

I'm planning to visit three countries after May. My first stop is Tirana, Albania. From there, I plan to take a train to Belgrade. **I think I need to take a bus from Tirana to Bar, Montenegro, but I'm not sure about the details.(need help!)**

I'd appreciate some advice on how long to stay in each place to fully explore the countries. For example, is 3 days enough in Skopje, or is 1 week too much in Belgrade?

Btw,  I'm wondering about transportation options. **Does Uber work in these cities, or should I rely on public transport?** It would be a huge advantage of using  my phone to request rides and get charged automatically without worrying about the payments or getting scammed.

**In terms of taking the train from Bar to Belgrade, I think tickets can't be purchased online. Is that correct?**

1k3178q,reddit,Best amazon trip in Peru: Iquitos vs Manu vs Tambopata,"Hi everyone,

I am currently in Peru and want to do a trip to the Amazon. Currently looking at minimum of a 4 night/5 day trip, happy to do a day or two more if budget allows (probably max out around $1000). 

Our initial research suggested Iquitos. However we are currently in Cusco, so rather then fly to Lima, then up to Iquitos, then back to Lima (our flights out of Peru are booked from Lima), we are now tempted more by Manu National Park or Tambopata, due to their (relative) proximity.

Can anyone tell us of their experiences in any of these respective places? 

We are not particularly interested in villages etc, the focus is very much on wildlife. We are experienced with trecking and are in good fitness, so somewhere less accessible would be ideal, because we don't want to be part of huge groups. We also are very keen on somewhere that is sustainable and does not bother the animals- we have 0 interest in places that bother animals to help tourists get pictures etc. 

Any advice or experiences would be appreciated (how you found an area, the tour provider you went with, animals you saw etc).

Shortly after my summer class ends on June 2nd, my family and I’d like to vacation. I suggested we go to a National Park, but my mom suggests we go to the beach.

I was thinking Ruby beach, but my mom wants warm weather and tanning. Washington can be cold so it seemed like a no go maybe. We have always gone to the beach during our once a year vacation (even if I don’t like it), and it’s usually always Florida or Georgia, or somewhere there.

I don’t mind driving an hour-2 hours to get the NP if it requires me to do so since I’m only one interested in hiking. 

A couple of important notes: 
- I’m based in TN
- My mom is disabled and uses a walking stick to get around, so if were to do a beach in a national park it’d have to be accessible (which is why I’m thinking a separate beach and NP might just be easier)
- This trip would be a week long and sometime after my class ends June 2nd. 
- I’d like to stay in the US but i’m open to international.

Thanks guys :)

1k2k2iq,reddit,Qantas/Jetstar lost our bags on a 4-day trip booked with Amex Travel — no answers after 2 days in KL,"Hi all,

My partner and I are currently in Kuala Lumpur and we still don’t have our checked luggage — it’s been two full days since we landed. I wanted to share our experience in case anyone’s been through something similar or can offer advice.

We booked this trip through Amex Travel in March using about $1,800 in flight credit that was expiring in June. We didn’t have many good options unless we traveled domestically, so we decided to spend more and turn it into a short international trip. In total, we paid around $4,000. Amex also added about $100 on top of the Qantas listed price, apparently due to travel insurance.

The flights were:
Perth → Singapore (Qantas)
Singapore → KL (Jetstar, operated by Qantas)

When we landed in KL on April 17 around 9 PM, our luggage didn’t come out. We waited until the belt stopped and confirmed with baggage services — nothing. We called both Qantas and Jetstar on the spot, but they basically pointed fingers at each other. Couldn’t contact Amex Travel because their support had already closed for the day.

We’ve had to buy essentials just to get by — I bought underwear, socks, a shirt, and walking shoes. My partner had to buy undergarments, toiletries, skincare, etc. I’ve been keeping all receipts in case we need them for a claim.

What’s worse is that all our plans for this trip have been impacted. We were supposed to go to Batu Caves, check out bars at night, and visit Petronas Towers dressed nicely. We even had a day trip planned to Genting Highlands. All of that’s basically on hold unless we go shopping here.

It rained on our first night, and I was only wearing my Adidas slides (only shoes I had in my carry-on). They had no grip and I nearly slipped a few times walking on the hotel pavement. I’ve got flat feet and my walking shoes were in my checked bag, so I was in pain every 10 minutes until I found new shoes to buy.

Day 2: Amex followed up with Qantas and Jetstar again. Qantas now says the bags arrived in Singapore, but no one seems to know what happens next or where they actually are. We’re still left waiting.

If anyone’s had something similar happen — especially with Qantas, Jetstar, or Amex Travel — would love to hear how you got it sorted. Also wondering what my chances are for getting compensated for all this mess.

Thanks in advance.

1k27uou,reddit,Spain 8 nights itenary - help me decide,"Hey everyone, 

Finally I've narrowed it down to Spain from Italy, France (Italy the best option but looking to avoid this due to the Jubilee this year not sure if i should just take the chance).

Nonetheless planning for a 8-9 nights in Spain around September mid (hope the weather will be decent).

My thought process so far,

Land in Barcelona  
Spent 3 nights in Barcelona  
Fly to Mallorca : Spend 3-4 nights there (base in palma may be)  
Fly back to Barcelona : Spend the last night there and take the flight back to Toronto.

But here's where the dilemma comes in. I'm a big Real Madrid fan and if I'm travelling all the way to Spain, I will definitely regret not visiting Santiago Bernabeau. 

Is there a way I can fit Madrid in? Thought about taking one way flight to madrid and return to toronto from barcelona but tickets are way expensive this way compared to a return flight to/from barcelona.

Overall what I'm looking for in this whole trip,  
\-Vibe is to explore the city (i can skip some monuments/main tourist attractions) but this is more of a relaxing trip for me.  
\-Need a beach vibe where I just sit and relax. I don't want to be running around much.

Help me with figuring this out.   
\-Is Mallorca a must visit according to what I said above? Or should I think about skipping it and visiting other parts closer to Barcelona and add Madrid in there.  
\-Or is there a way I can fit everything in.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts. ",2025-04-18 15:35:29,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,1,3,,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k27uou/spain_8_nights_itenary_help_me_decide/,Coach-Alert

1k1invr,reddit,Advice for Trip to South of France,"My partner and I are planning a trip to the South of France for 10 nights in September. We will be flying into Nice on the 13th of September, and then back home from Lyon on the 23rd. I was hoping to get some input on a possible itinerary for us. 

This is our initial plan:

* Two nights in Nice
* Two nights in Cannes
* Two nights in Marseille
* One night in Aix-en-Provence
* Three nights in Lyon

We will be traveling between these cities by train or flixbus. We do not have access to a car and are on somewhat of a budget. My partner also gets very travel sick and 4.5 hours on a bus or train is their absolute limit. Please do let us know if these cities are the right places to visit or if we should consider other places instead and whether these amounts of time in each city are realistic.

I will provide a brief list of things that are important to us in a vacation, in order:

1. Food. Not fine dining (again, budget), but we love trying regional foods. My partner is a real sweet tooth too.
2. Seeing the sights/walking around. Sounds a little dumb, but our favourite thing to do is just to wander around the city. Maybe look around a few shops (books and comics especially) or sit in a park.
3. Nature. We’re not big hikers and we do not have access to a car, so I’m sure many more ‘nature-y’ places out of the city are out of the question, but we do enjoy seeing green/natural spaces.
4. Beaches. Not looking to spend 10 days baking in the sun, but two or three afternoons on the beach would be nice.
5. Other activities. My partner isn't into museums and we are on a budget, but non-museum activities/sights that are under 15eu pp might interest us.

Please let us know if we should amend our itinerary or if you have tips for any of the aforementioned places!",2025-04-17 17:33:55,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,1,2,,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k1invr/advice_for_trip_to_south_of_france/,gayliens98
1k1hnqu,reddit,Where else can I go for tropical vibes for my birthday?,"Hi, I want to take a trip for my 25th birthday this year in August with my boyfriend and I’m leaning on settling with Hawaii. I’m kinda settling because I don’t have much experience traveling out of the U.S (tbh traveling in general 😭), but I want to go somewhere tropical. I’m still open to the idea of traveling outside the country though. We mainly want to swim in beautiful blue CLEAR water. I keep second guessing where to go because I know Hawaii can be pricey, so possibly I could go somewhere better/similar for the same budget price? Our budget is ideally 3-4k. I know, 4k max budget is crazy low for Hawaii, but I think it can be done lol! 😂 Through Costco travel, I found a package to Ohau that included flight, hotel stay for 5 nights and car rental for  around $2300 total, departing from Sacramento.

My parents have gone to all-inclusives in Mexico, and I’ve found a few all inclusive packages from Costco Travel that cost around the same or even less than the Hawaii packages. BUT, I’m also iffy about traveling to that area like Cancun because of the hurricane/sargassum season during that time. Our main reason for traveling to these places was to swim in the beautiful clear beaches, so I don’t know if I should risk the trip out there with the sargassum.

I'm also incredibly decision fatigued from work and life, so this is my attempt to outsource the decision of where to go and what to do. 

I'm within what I consider easy day-trip distance of DC, Baltimore, Wilmington DE, and Philadelphia (I've been to everywhere except Wilmington at least once, Philly the most often, but I don't feel like I've even come close to fully exploring any of these places). Also open to hearing your pitch for smaller towns in those areas that I might not have considered. 

Where should I go, and what should I do while I'm there?

Questions:

1. The general plan is to go via taxi/bus from Medan to Jakarta and then finally to Bali. The trip will be roughly 16 days split 3 ways for each location. *Is there stuff worthwhile in Southern Sumatra, or are we better off blasting full speed to Jakarta once we're done with hiking adventures around Medan?*

2. How many days would you recommend devoting to just Jakarta as opposed to exploring the rest of Java? My only other big trip was Turkey and I remember wishing I had spent additional days in Istanbul just to scratch more than the surface.

3. How safe would this trip be for families with young children? Our friend group includes parents with a 2 year old that may decide to join.

We are Americans. We don't speak French and we have very basic Spanish but we have no problem getting by even with language barriers.

* Flying into and out of Nice.
* We are renting a car(have experience driving in Germany/Czech Republic but not France/Spain so if there is anything we need to know chime in... We did get a ticket in Czech Republic for driving on a toll road without paying the toll. I though there would be toll plazas. There are not.
* We MUST go to Carcassonne(Family Bucket list item is to play Carcassonne in Carcassonne) but not sure how long to stay there. 
* We do not need to spend as much time in bigger cities. We tend to like mid-sized and smaller cities and we like to wander although we will almost certainly go to Barcelona and are open to bigger cities.
* We love culture/food/wandering. Small museums. Wineries. Off the beaten path touristy things. Small walkable cities with interesting history. Unique experiences (Making chocolate from raw cacao in Mexico). Good restaurants but not necessarily fancy. 

We did Amsterdam to Cologne to Prague 2 years ago as a family and learned a lot about what we do and don't like.

* Flew in to Amsterdam, which was great. Very walkable. Unique. Loved Van Gogh Museum and seeing the Ann Frank house was very moving and eye opening for the kids. Touristy, but very enjoyable. Best part was just walking the city.
* Cologne was cool. Loved the Cathedral. We stayed in a small city, Neuss near Cologne and we liked it. Meh... Cologne is cool but other than the cathedral I wouldn't really care to go back.
* Wandered to Quedlinburg. Loved the drive. Stopped at a few places along the way. 
* Spent 3 days in Quedlinburg(Playing the game Quacks of Quedlinburg in Quedlinburg was a highlight) and loved just walking around the city. This is one of our favorite travel experiences. Restaurant Helena was our favorite meal in Germany. 
* Wandered to Dresden via Leipzig and did a factory tour of the Volkswagen Glass Factory. Another highlight. 
* Drove to Prague and spent 5 days in Prague. We liked Prague, but it was too touristy. Enjoyed some of the tours. Would have cut this down to 2 days if I did it again. Favorite things in Prague were a Plague Tour where we wandered the city at night with a ""Plague Doctor"" and he told us about the history of the city specifically during the multiple plagues. 
* While in Prague we took a day trip to Kutna Hora (where the bone church is). Loved it. The Cathedral was our favorite cathedral we saw on our trip. The drive too and from was great as well.
* Drove to Nuremburg and stopped in Pilzen on the way. We liked Pilzen. One of our favorite meals of the trip was at Le Frenchie café) and Nuremburg was OK.
* Flew out of Frankfurt.

Were thinking about wandering through Andora. Is it worth it?

As a side note, we ~~like~~LOVE factory tours. The Volkswagen Factory was really cool. We like nature but aren't looking for long nature hikes. Food is huge for is. Love good restaurants but not chains. Bonus points for fun/unique history and culture things to do.

Would have loved to do a restaurant and drinks with mountain views, especially on our way to the salt flats - but struggling on finding a place. Alta Lodge will be closed. Not sure is Snowbird's base-views are worth it.

 * Things to do? Any insider recos and tips would be super cool! Any seasonal things that we shouldn't miss?

 * Bars / Drinks: We like R&B Music and top 40 hiphop. We like nice speakeasy vibes for cocktails. We like nice views and good vibes. We like dancing. We are down for live music. This is the area that we really don't know lol. Wrote some stuff down online but really don't know!

1k0st04,reddit,Milford Sound from Queenstown,"Hello, I know there are a few posts about this but wanted to get some comments on our specific situation. We will be in Queenstown in beginning of July and plan a trip to Milford sound with 9 and 11 yr olds. Here are the different scenarios to consider:

We’d like to have 2 days (1night) for the trip.

1 We will arrive to Queenstown in a Campervan and thought we could keep it and return it until we get back. So we thought about driving in the campervan from QT to MS, then stay at the powered campsite there. Either driving very early, do the boat tour and stay the night. Then drive back the next morning from MS to QT.

2 Second option is to return the campervan and rent an SUV, then same thing drive to MS but now we’d have to either stay at the very expensive cabins in MS one night, or stay a night in Te Anau either the night before or the day right after the boat tour.

3 Take a 12hr tour in bus same day. (I think this might be too tiring and we wouldn’t be able to stop for photos since I heard the road has some amazing scenery for photo stops.

I‘ve heard different opinions and would like to have more information to make our decision.

I've been to Bali in november of 2023. I really enjoyed the trip due to the following factors and i am now searching for a new destination which is not Bali but checks the same basic aspects

\- obvious things first: The weather beeing very humid and warm. 30-35°C with 90% humidity is just amazing

\- scenery of Bali and Nusa Penida. The combination of tropical forest, seaside and a bit mountainous areas, waterfalls and also dry areas of nusa penida

\- not sure whether we were lucky but it was never crowded (probably good timing of november)

\- calm areas and smaller restaurants as well as very cheap street food

\- destinations beeing quite close so that I can drive by scooter from hotel to hotel

I am not looking for the crowded parts of Kuta or Ubid with the fancy cafe's, bars or clubs nor big beaches to relax.

We rented a scooter both on bali and nusa penida, and drove around ubud, Gobleng and as mentioned nusa penida, visiting waterfalls and enjoying the scenery. I want to take my drone with me again and idealy do something similiar: rent a scooter go with a backback from hotel to hotel and explore places, flying my drone and enjoying calm areas. 

I am thinking about thailand (without any specific areas yet) but I am not sure whether bigger distances make the idea of going by backpack on a scooter impossible.

Does anybody maybe know a place that fits this?",2025-04-16 18:59:55,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,1,3,,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1k0sfcn/travel_destination_simmiliar_to_bali/,sledgar

Also, in case I can't leave as early as planned or if I need to stop for the night, are there any recommended places to stay along the route?(Mex-LP)

1jzqoeh,reddit,Insight from frequent flyers,"Hi flyers,


I like to think I’m a fairly experienced flyer, but I don’t fly enough to have any kind of status and not too little that I don’t know what to do. I just recently took two US domestic flights (EWR to SEA, and then SFO to EWR). There were some things I noticed and some things I had questions/curious about from the frequent flyer community. 


1. I have been flying United for years and have been a mileage plus member as well. I have always been in boarding group 5 regardless of selecting an economy plus seat or even a preferred seat. Is this only a status thing? I’m not asking to be in group 1 or 2, but how am I never in group 3 or 4? 


2. Do you prefer to check in bags for domestic flights? Or do you just check everything in and don’t have to drag your bags around? I know some people have connecting flights and checking in wouldn’t help them in that situation. But for all others, what do you prefer?


3. I noticed some posts on this sub and on other flights related subs about asking for upgrades at the gate. I mentioned I don’t have any status with any airline. But every time I’ve flown, I make it a point to ask the gate agent for upgrade chances right near boarding time. 9 times out of 10, it has worked for me. Just recently on my trip from SFO to EWR, I got upgraded from all the way last row to an economy plus seat. I know there are factors like how empty the flight is, status, upgrade cost, etc. But it has worked for me most of the time. Others have similar experience?


4. As frequent flyers (or just experienced/capable flyers), do you look down on people who may not know what they’re doing or do you offer to help? I’ve seen both types of people, which is why I’m asking. There was someone on my flight who was clearly struggling figuring out her seat and her tv monitor, but nobody helped until she called for a FA. I also took a flight where I was seated in an emergency row window seat with a missing seat in front of me, so I was confused where to put my backpack. The lady in the row in front immediately turned and helped put my bag below the seat in front of her for takeoff and gave it back once in the air. I just wanted to ask the frequent flyers if you’re willing to help or let the FA handle it? 


5. Flying etiquette. Is it normal for people to take shoes/socks off during flight? Is it ok to lay down if your row is empty and you have all three seats to yourself? Any other flight etiquette issues you have seen? 



I’m asking these as a way to get insight into how people fly and how to improve my own experience moving forward. Thank you for any advice and/or suggestions!

1jz1u59,reddit,4 Day Trip to Southern France – Feedback Wanted,"**Hi everyone,**

I was wondering if someone who’s local or has been to the area could have a look at my itinerary and let me know if it sounds like a good plan—or suggest something better.

My partner and I are flying to Toulouse for about four days (not full days, since the first and last are mainly for travel—but we do have an early inbound flight and a late outbound one) in June.

My idea was to spend one day in Toulouse, stay overnight in a hotel, and then head to Carcassonne the next morning. We’d spend the afternoon there—have lunch, maybe do a wine tasting—and then in the late evening, drive toward the coast.

I found a beautiful seaside town called Collioure, but it’s quite far, so I’m not sure if it’s worth the long drive given our limited time. I was also considering staying somewhere closer to Narbonne Plage, but based on what I’ve seen on Google Street View, I’m unsure if it has the right vibe.

Can anyone advise whether this plan makes sense, or if there are better alternatives or areas we should consider exploring instead?

We are a fast paced couple who like to get up and out. I myself, love a city break due to the fast paced environment and options but also like to mix that with local culture, whether that be food or activities. My partner is very similar but she is very partial to a relaxing beach holiday. We’ve done a lot of traveling around Europe specifically but we’ve never step foot in Asia but a lot of our bucket list destinations sit within this continent. 

As we are both now approaching 30 we wanted to tick some of our bucket list items off and see a few areas of SE Asia before we settle down and try to create our own little family. That being said, I’ve put together the below itinerary for our trip and would like some suggestions or opinions on what we have planned. We could only get just under 5 weeks off work and our trip will be ending with 4 nights in Tokyo which I have not included as it is a non-negotiable for us. The itinerary has taken into account many of the ‘tourist hotspots’ that we would like to visit as well as some other activities. 

Just a little side note, northern Thailand is not something we are that keen on due to the travel route I originally planned but I’m open to being convinced otherwise.

1jyjb7p,reddit,One-Month Road Trip Advice – NYC to LA via Miami & New Orleans,"Hi all! I’m planning a one-month road trip across the US (flexible dates between May and August). My main city stops will be New York City, Miami, New Orleans, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles. I love big cities *and* offbeat attractions, so I want to mix tourist highlights with hidden gems and quirky stops along the way.

**Route Help:** What’s the best way to connect these dots? I’m thinking of starting in NYC, driving down the East Coast to Miami, then west to New Orleans, and onward to Las Vegas and L.A. Is this too much for one month? Any route tweaks you’d suggest (or must-drive highways vs. ones to avoid)?

**Car or No Car:** I’ll likely rent a car for flexibility, but I’m open to flying a segment if it saves a lot of time. Did anyone do a similar multi-city trip without driving the whole way? (I’ve heard drop-off fees for one-way car rentals can be high – any advice or alternatives?).

**Interests:** I’m into nature, roadside oddities, local food, comedy and live music, and art museums. Some specific things I’d love to find on the route: cool small towns, “world’s largest” roadside attractions, kitschy museums, beautiful hikes or parks, maybe a comedy nights in unexpected places. For example, I’m curious about the Blue Ridge Parkway, New Orleans voodoo tours, Texas barbecue joints, alien stuff in Roswell, the Grand Canyon, Joshua Tree, etc. If you have favorite hidden gems between any of my major stops, I’d **love** to hear them!

**Timing:** How should I budget my time? Of course I want a few days in NYC and LA each, but I also don’t want to shortchange the journey in between. If you’ve done a coast-to-coast trip, what would you recommend in terms of nights on the road vs. in the big cities?

**Other Tips:** Any can’t-miss detours or events between May–Aug? And any tools or websites for planning this kind of complex route? (I’m using Roadtrippers and Atlas Obscura to find odd attractions already).

Thanks in advance! I’m feeling both excited and a bit overwhelmed by the planning, so any advice or personal experiences are much appreciated.",2025-04-13 22:03:00,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,1,4,,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jyjb7p/onemonth_road_trip_advice_nyc_to_la_via_miami_new/,blackscreenpancle

It looks like CFAR only works for cancelations 2 days before a trip and they only pay out between 50-75% of the trip cost.

And Pre existing conditions waiver requires purchase of the plan within 2-3 weeks of booking.

Most companies only offer 10-15 days to cancel a policy for a refund.

I’ve been told that May is an underrated month to go because its sunny, things start to bloom and the weather isn’t perfect for hiking as it’s not too hot or not too cold. In addition it’s also relatively cheap. On the flip side, I’ve also been told it’s a no go because it rains a lot thus limiting the outdoor activities and also the ability to see the views that these places offer which is another reason I want to go. To anyone who’s been to these places in May or live in these places, what would your overall guidance be surrounding this? Would it be ok to do this in May or better to push this back till June?

1jy9des,reddit,Switzerland itinerary check for the Women's Euros,"Hello,

I am travelling to Switzerland (from the UK) for the Women's Euros in July and would like some advice on our itinerary - mainly any thoughts on where to stay as a base, and thoughts on specific cities we are going to, must see places etc. We have free travel the days we attend any games, so plan to use the trains on these days to travel with no cost. 

Also, if anyone else is going to the Euros and you have your itinerary locked in, it would be great to hear your plan.

  
July 6 - Fly to Basel, stay for 2 nights (would somewhere on the French side of the border be as good option?)

July 7 - Europa Park (it has been on my list for the longest time)

July 8 - Travel to Lucerne, stay for 1 night. Attend Sweden vs Poland

July 9 - Travel to Zurich, stay for 2 nights. Attend England vs Netherlands

July 10 - Explore Zurich

July 11 - Travel to Bern, stay for 2 nights. Attend Italy vs Spain

July 12 - Visit Grindelwald

July 13 - Travel to St Gallen, stay for 2 nights. Attend England vs Wales

July 14 - Explore St Gallen

July 15 - Travel home

1jy8z35,reddit,First Indonesian trip suggestions,"Hi!

My partner and I (late 20s) will be visiting Indonesia for the first time for 18 days in August and we are finding it really hard to craft our itinerary.

The first thing we would like to avoid is mass-tourism, so we are definitely skipping Bali. We would like to find places a bit further away from the common touristic path in order to explore more closely the culture and way of life.

Some things we would like to see/do in our trip are:
- Renting a scooter to explore an area at our own pace 
- Volcano trekking and waterfalls
- Beaches, preferibly with lush green vegetation (i.e we have seen pictures of beaches in South Lombok and they don't all appeal to us so much)
- Optionally, doing surf for one day if it fits (beginner level)

We initially thought of Yogjakarta/Mt Bromo/Mt Ijen, Lombok (we have read mixed reviews of it though, even though Mt. Rinjani is appealing) or some parts of Sumatra (here we don't know much as it is massive, but seems stunning).

Could you please give us suggestions for our trip?

PS: we will be arriving at Kuala Lumpur and departing from Jakarta.

1jy5sed,reddit,My Jordan and Egypt Experiences,"Hey everyone,

I just got back from a trip to Jordan and Egypt. I want to share my unusual experiences of my trip. Some of them could be true for any trip in the world.

1.	⁠I have forgotten to register for Careem in my country so I must have to register it in sharm el sheikh but I couldn’t register on Careem (Middle East’s version of Uber) because I couldn’t do SMS verification. I didn’t know how to activate my Turkish line for SMS. Learn it from youtube, it is easy.

2.	⁠Avoid using the Royssat bus station in Sharm El Sheikh. It felt completely unsafe because no one is there. Only you are waiting for your bus there. It is like a Hollywood horror movie. Even if you bought your ticket for royssat, you can go to watania which is more modern because watania is the second station of all busses after royssat. Do not go to royssat! Go to watania. Also, watania is more closer to city center.

3.	⁠We had a $100 bill and we could not changed it. Some banks in Cairo were randomly closed, and even ATMs or exchange offices often don’t have enough cash to give change for $100. Time was running out, so we took an Uber to the airport. I thought that I can change it inside the airport, so I went through security, but the exchange desk didn’t have enough USD to give me change either. Luckily, I saw another tourist exchanging dollars. So, now exchange office had 95 dollar to give me as change. Meanwhile, the Uber driver was waiting outside for 15 minutes. When I finally tried to go back outside to give him his fare, the police didn’t let me exit. I didn’t know that after you passed the first security, you cant go outside again. It is different in Turkey and European countries. After begging the officer several times, he agreed to personally take the cash to the driver, but he asked me some tips.

4.	⁠In Jordan, when we returning from Wadi rum to Amman, I have decided to stop at Ma’an because there is a wonderful bakery having delicious deserts of which I have tasted before. The bakery is Hasheem Affouri. Also, google reviews are great. We thought that Jordan is more modern and safe country after we saw Wadi Musa and Wadi Rum which are the most touristix cities of Jordan. We had wrong. Do not go to Ma’an which is dangerous. Only men are outside in the city and always stares you. We did not know that there is also Hasheem Affouri bakery in Wadi Musa. Buy your pasteries in Wadi Musa.

1jy4fg0,reddit,Chile 72 hour transit visa from Australians,"Hello my partner and I are from Melbourne, Australia and we are travelling to Colombia.

As part of our travels, we have a transit stop in Santiago, Chile both on the way there and on our return to Melbourne.

On the way to Colombia, we have a transit stop in Chile for around 9 hours.

On the way back home, our transit stop is around 5 hours.

We understand that Australians require a visa to enter Chile, where the transit exceeds 8 hours or you are required to go through/immigration customs to collect your baggage.

We have applied for a 72 hour transit visa and awaiting these from the Chile Consulate.

We are a little nervous and want to ensure we are doing the right thing.

Our question is, will the 72 hour transit visa be sufficient for the return trip from Chile to Melbourne? I.e Once the visa is granted, will it allow for multiple entries and exits (ie just can’t stay for more than 72 hours each entry - ie you need to be transiting) or will are we required to obtain separate transit visas for each leg of the trip?

I and my wife will be visiting Mauritius from India. I was looking at the car rental and I am totally confused with a few things. Ideally, I am looking for a car rental with full insurance and no deposit. Any suggestion on that front. 

Should I go for discovercars or easycabs? Are their insurances worth it? Can I rely on insurances provided by the local rentals?

What is a excess? It is mentioned at a lot of places, not sure what it is. 

How are roads in Mauritius? Should I worry about them? I consider myself to be a very safe driver and as an Indian, already know how to drive on the left hand side of the road.   
  
Should I worry too much about the deposit? Read at the few places that while handing over the car, car agencies try to make you sign the papers so that they can claim the deposit as people are looking to catch the flight.

We're trying to get a good mix of outdoors activities (keen for some good hiking and a horse ride or two, biking and kayaking also an interest), viewing wildlife, experiencing the natural hot springs and mountain town vibes of the state, and good food & craft breweries with some live music. Struggling to find a schedule that isn't too packed but fits in some of the key things we want to do - the tricky one being that we want to do the Black Canyon and my partner really wants to do the vapor caves in Glenwood Springs, which doesn't make for a convenient drive when we have to start and end in Denver! So the idea for the loop would be Route 50 one way and I70 another way - so basically general areas are:
- from Denver
- then to Colorado Springs (GotG, Cheyenne Mtn, Manitou Springs?)
- then to Cañon City (Royal Gorge)
- then to Salida (Poncha Springs, Buena Vista?)
- then to Gunnison (Crested Butte?)
- then to Montrose (Black Canyon)
- then to Glenwood Springs (Iron Mountain Springs, Vapor Caves)
- then to Golden (Red Rocks)

Obviously this misses out some key sites (Durango, Telluride, Boulder, RMNP) but it isn't possible for us to tick off everything without feeling like we're rushing around. If anyone has any advice on how to optimise this route for our interests (places to cull for redundancy etc, extra places to add on that are a short detour) where we can spend more time on foot and less time in the car, that would be appreciated!",2025-04-10 14:53:49,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,1,1,,0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jvzvah/early_may_colorado_trip/,burgundy-sky

1jvbv84,reddit,Recommendation for a mid-august trip in Europe,"Hello everyone, reposting this with additional details as per Rule 4.

Me and my SO will both have our vacation days available in mid-august, from the 11th to the 24th, and will likely pick the second week.

Since a few years ago I have avoided visiting cities during summer to avoid the heat, instead opting for spring and autumn, but we have not yet visited a city together, and have instead opted to stay in the mountains relatively nearby (northern Italy) in our travels together so far.  
I would like to change things up this year, buuut I would also like to avoid heatstroke.  
Is there an European capital or cities in general that are not too terribly hot that you would recommend?  
By terribly hot I mean we would like to avoid a weather comparable or worse than how it is in northern Italy during the summer, usually in the mid to high 30s and lots of humidity.  
I think countries at a similar latitude as Italy would not work because of this, ruling out Lisbon and Athens for example, don't know about Eastern Europe.

There are some that I'd rather not pick because one of us has already been there, or because we plan a group trip in the future (Iceland) , so the ones that have come to mind so far were Dublin, Amsterdam and Oslo (where unfortunately one of the museums I would like to visit is closed currently, so I would postpone).  
There's also Warsaw, which is a bit more towards the south, Helsinki and the Baltic states, these I haven't read up on much yet.  
  
We have been, by ourselves, to Berlin, Paris, Prague, Wien, Stockholm, Madrid and Copenhaghen, and both really liked Prague in particular (and I also enjoyed Wien a lot, I found them somewhat similar).  
We enjoy museums, castles, old towns and so on, the standard fare, and we hike a lot during the year, so if there is any interesting destination for one day outside the city, it would be cool as well.  
  
We would likely stay for less than a week, budget would be in the 150ish € per night range, more if necessary (: as long as the hotel is in a decent position, is not dirty and the beds are not made of stone we are fine, we would be spending most of the day out and about anyway.  
  
Any recommendations? I am focusing mostly on capital cities, but I know that of course there are plenty of amazing places all over, I just tend to opt for them when I first visit a country, but if you have any other kind of suggestionfor smaller towns and other areas it will be definitely a welcome addition, as there may be more options that involve cooler temperatures.

1jv32ki,reddit,"Inexperienced traveller asking for advice on trip to France, Spain, or Italy including vineyard tours/tastings - detailed post","Hi all. I've long been interested in short holidays from the UK to some of the biggest wine-producing countries in Europe, but I'm not an experienced traveller. I'm also what you might call ""geographically challenged""; until I've been to a country/place, I find it very difficult to figure out distances or what's on offer nearby. 

I've done some Googling about vineyards and places to stay, and also tried to have a look around south-west France on Google Maps. With both, I've just ended up more confused than I started. I've also done some searching here, but thought in the end it's better to start a thread with my specifics, seeking advice.

Since I'm not very versed in travelling, the below are based on best guesses. Please can you share your ideas?

**Budget**: £2000 for flights and hotel for two people. Other activities/tours/taxis/travel not included in this budget.

**Duration**: Either 5 or 7 days (including travel).

**Where you’re starting**: We live in Scotland UK, so we'd be looking to travel from Edinburgh/Glasgow, or Manchester airport if necessary. At a stretch we could fly from London airports, though this would be much less convenient.

I'm interested in visiting France, Spain, and/or Italy and seeing some vineyards in those countries. I'm not talking about going to \_all\_ those countries on one visit; it'd be an either or/one country per trip. What I'm asking for is good areas - and within that maybe narrowed down to places/hotels - to stay in those countries based on the rest of the information.

We'd be looking for comfort, peace, and quietness in our hotel/place to stay.

**Interests & preferences**: My husband and I like quiet hotels and pretty views, and are looking for areas to visit in the countryside rather than cities. We especially like staying by the sea and this would be a bonus, though appreciate this may not be possible in all cases when trying to be near vineyards. 

We also like good food and would be looking to include plenty of that in our trip, be that within the hotel or in nearby towns. 

Due to health reasons I can't walk very far, and distances need to be supplemeneted by automotive transport (e.g. taxis, or possibly driving although this latter is not very useful if we're visiting vineyards - want to be able to enjoy the wine). Although this detail on walking/health might limit how much we can do or how far we can go in a given day and may mean we need to stick close-ish to our hotel, it is what it is. 

We'd be looking for a slow pace trip combining some activities and some downtime, not packing in loads of stuff every second of the day.

I'm interested in visiting vineyards especially, to both look round them and partake in tastings of their wines. Please see list below of favourite grapes and so vineyards (/wine areas) I'd prefer to narrow selection down to.

We would also be happy to soak up some culture/things to see or do in quiet, small nearby areas.

Favourite grapes so far: 

* France: Malbec, Syrah, and Grenache; secondary favourites Cab Sav and Mourvèdre
* Italy: Sangiovese, Amarone; secondary favourites Primitivo and Montepulciano 
* Spai: don't know Spanish wines so well. Do like Tempranillo (esp in Rioja blends) but that's fairly standard I guess

If we go to France, I'm especially keen to see some vineyards associated with my favourite grapes there. Of the old world wines, French is my favourite wine region. In general of course there's never anything wrong with trying new-to-me grapes and finding new favourites!

I hope this post has enough detail. I'd welcome any advice or thoughts on where we should stay, and the vineyards, food and activities that fit with our parameters here.

I rang Emirates. They said my only option is to cancel our flights and cop the $1,000 cancellation fee. Oh, and those comfortable seats we booked at over $400? They are nonrefundable. 

I'm now wondering whether it would be better to change the booking to a couple of months into the future, then change it again when the actual dates I want become available. The double change would cost around $900, and the seat booking would be carried over, so theoretically I'd be over $500 better off.

1jucal5,reddit,Question regarding Emirates refund,"Hello. Quick question.

  
My mother booked through a travel agent to fly business class from London to Seoul then back from Bangkok to London. Unfortunately my dad was rushed to hospital and will spend weeks there.

  
The travel agent has canceled the ticket but is saying that she is only entitled to 235 GBP \[about $300\] of a $4000 ticket back.

  
Speaking to Emirates, the fee for canceling is 500 GBP \[about $650\]. Does it seem right that the travel agent \[dialaflight\] can keep the remaining cash?

  
Anyone have any feedback on this?

1juai6h,reddit,USA Travel Round 2!,"Hey everyone! Last year I posted here for feedback on our US travel itinerary in the summer.

[Last Year's Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ct9xat/opinion_needed_for_usa_family_trip_in_june/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

  
Safe to say we had an amazing time as a family! Despite some minor bumps and some tweaking on the itinerary on-the-go, we would say the trip was a memorable one - particularly Yosemite NP was a highlight. Stunning views, majestic trees and good weather all round.

  
So now we're planning for our second trip in the summer (June) of 2026 and would like some recommendation as well as advices. As of now, we have narrowed to two options, but still early in our brainstorming stage so we're open to other ideas

Our criterias:

i) 3 weeks time span

ii) Something slightly different in our National Park experience than before

iii) 1 or 2 stops in a big city would be nice as a break from sightseeing and a little shopping.

  
**Option 1 - Miami, Everglades NP, Great Smoky Mountains NP, Washington, Philly and New York**

First few days in Miami, take a flight to Atlanta, rent a car to GSMNP and road trip all the way to Washington - a few days there, then Philly and lastly New York

  
**Option 2 - Las Vegas, Grand Canyon NP, Zion NP, Denver and Rocky Mountains NP**

Start off in Las Vegas and then road trip to Denver while stopping at Grand Canyon NP and Zion NP for a couple of days each before arriving in Denver and explore Rocky Mountains NP.

  
I'm looking for inputs on weather, stop options (activities for families), how many days are recommended and whether the road trip journey is even feasible. We are also aware that the World Cup will be happening during that time and also partly hoping that we can get tickets depending on which option we take.

We don't mind spending only 3-4 days in each NP as we found that 4 days in Yosemite NP is enough for us family.

I know this might be a stupid question, but after a few posts I've seen of people struggling due to the new ETA regulations for the EU when visiting the UK...

If you travelled to the UK with an eta ever since the rule went into effect in April; how was it? 
Did you have any issues or take longer than usual?
Are there are precautions one should take?

I already read a post saying to print out the approval notification email despite what the email itself says and did so... anything else I should pay attention to?

I’m from Belgium and in a few months, I’ll be traveling with my family to Canada and the USA for about 6–7 months. Right now, I’m in the process of comparing different travel insurance options and could really use some advice from others who’ve done something similar.

Another option I’m considering is the Visa Gold card from Crelan, which offers coverage for up to 180 days, but the medical assistance limit is only €25,000, which seems quite low for North America.

As for us, we like relaxing, but also going out and doing touristy things. We’re both relatively cheap, and would want to do things somewhat on a budget. We drink, but aren’t crazy drinkers, and like good food but don’t want to pay an arm and a leg for a “foodie experience.

In doing a quick google search, it seems the weather will be 70-80 F during the day and 50-60 F at night, which could be really fun to do a camper van after spending some time in Lisbon. Other considerations are Porto and a trip out to the Duoro Valley, Algarve in the south, Sintra and Cascais, Nazare for the big waves, etc etc.

Nothing is out of the way at the moment, as well still have a lot to plan and very little time. 

  
Initial ideas are: 2-3 days in Lisbon. Rent a van, drive out to Sintra and Cascais, stop somewhere along the coast. Hit Nazare and head up to Porto 1-2 days. Dip out to the Duoro Valley for a day. drive down to Algarve for the last night. return to Lisbon and fly home.

*i like a loose itinerary with flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they pop up

Places we definitely want to go:
- Edinburgh (and day or two in and around the city exploring)
- Rosslyn Chapel

The Lowlands :
- my maiden name is Armstrong so we are visiting their ancestral homelands. Doesn't seem to be more than a day in that area.
- Gilnockie Castle and surrounding areas

Highlands :
-I'm thinking of using Inverness as a ""homebase"" while we spend a few days exploring the Highlands. Is there a better option?

Other ideas:
- Glencoe
- Culloden 
- Castle Stirling
- Are there other castles we need to see?
- Loch Lomand
- Loch Ness? I've seen some say to skip it?
- Train to Glenfinnan Viaduct

We love coffee shops, bookstores, game stores, and days spent in nature. We hike and camp often and don't mind walking/hiking several miles a day. We're history buffs, especially military history. We love the idea of renting a car and just driving!

Does anyone know if we will be stopped from entering the country in the first place with the flight tickets that are 62 days apart? If that is not a problem, can I then just go and apply for an extension immediately for our full stay?  
If they will not allow us into the country with the flights so far apart, is it better to book a flight out within 30 days. Then go into the country. Then apply for the extension, then cancel the flight and then stay on as was planned, and take the original flight back.

Hi everyone,

I’m planning to travel to Taiwan with my child and his dad in December 2025. We’re not married, but our child is already 13 years old. My concern is about my travel history.

I traveled to Cambodia twice on a tourist visa, 7 and 8 years ago. Both times, I entered as a tourist but ended up working there. On my second trip, the immigration officer (IO) asked me if my OFW status was canceled, and I said yes because I didn’t even know I had been tagged as an OFW. I only stayed there for a short time, less than 3 months, before returning to the Philippines.

Both times, I also did visa runs to Vietnam to extend my stay. Now, I’m worried that when I travel this December, even though I’ll be with my child and his dad, I might be questioned by immigration. I’m also concerned that they might ask me for a canceled OEC, especially since I’m not sure if I was officially tagged as an OFW on my second trip.

**Disclaimer:** Please don’t judge me for my past decisions. I know I should’ve followed the proper process, but life has changed, and we are truly blessed now with the opportunity to travel and take a vacation. I now work as a freelancer.

I will be visiting cannon beach on Thursday and will only be there for one night. I wish to see haystack rock. But that’s all that I know. I will be driving in from Seattle and reaching cannon beach around 4/5pm on Thursday. I will first go to haystack and watch the sunset.

I will need to find a breakfast place that’s open around 6/7am (most I saw so far are not open until 8am). Any suggestions on where I can grab an early meal?

1jtb03o,reddit,Help planning a Nepal trip (16–22 June) for a group of 8 (mixed age group) — how does this itinerary sound?,"Hey everyone! I’d love some advice on planning a 7-day trip to Nepal from 16 to 22 June 2025. We’re a group of 8 people — 4 of us are in our late 20s and the other 4 are around 60, including my dad, who’s turning 60 during the trip. So we’re hoping to make it special with a mix of scenic, cultural, and nature experiences that aren’t too physically intense.

Here’s the rough itinerary I’ve come up with:

🗓️ 16 June – Arrive in Kathmandu (\~3:30 PM), stay overnight  
🗓️ 17 June – Explore Kathmandu (Swayambhunath, Patan Durbar, and a private pooja at Pashupatinath Temple to mark my dad’s 60th birthday)  
🗓️ 18 June – Fly to Pokhara, explore Lakeside and Phewa Lake  
🗓️ 19 June – Drive Pokhara → Bandipur (scenic stop + lunch) → Chitwan National Park (arrive by evening)  
🗓️ 20 June – Safari and jungle activities in Chitwan  
🗓️ 21 June – Fly back to Kathmandu, relax or light sightseeing  
🗓️ 22 June – Depart from Kathmandu

A few things I’d love your input on:

* Is Chitwan the right pick for wildlife, or should we consider another park like Bardia for this kind of group?
* Any thoughts on Bandipur as a stopover — is it worth it, or would it be better to head straight to Chitwan?
* Any tips for organizing a private pooja at Pashupatinath Temple? (We're doing this as a special part of the birthday celebration.)
* Any suggestions to make the 60th birthday extra memorable — either in Kathmandu or somewhere along the way?
* General feedback — does this itinerary feel too rushed or does it strike a good balance for a mixed-age group?

Really appreciate any ideas, recommendations, or experiences you can share! 🙏",2025-04-07 02:34:54,travel,travel,lifestyle,Lifestyle,[],0,1,0,,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1jtb03o/help_planning_a_nepal_trip_1622_june_for_a_group/,Sea-Competition-5409

1jt6wgj,reddit,Itinerary Review & Advice for Germany and Austria.,"Hello! I'm 27F traveling for 2 weeks in Germany & Austria in late July to early August and I could use some help planning my itinerary. I'm flying in from Canada to Dublin on July 24th and will be leaving from Dublin on August 7th. This is my 3rd time in Europe, however it is my first time solo travelling and am looking forward to experiencing a lot of nature in these two countries! I’m an experienced hiker and in good shape, so I want to do as much hiking as I can. I will not be renting a car, and will be using trains/buses for transport whenever I can! 

Here's the VERY ROUGH timeline I have in mind:
* Day 1: arrive in Dublin, staying for 1 night. 
* Day 2: Fly from Dublin to Munich, stay 1 night. 
* Day 3: Train from Munich to Salzburg, explore for the day. 
* Days 4: Take a bus to Berchtesgaden and hike around that area, return to Salzburg at the end of the day. 
* Days 5: Spend the day in Salzburg, maybe do some tours or visit museums. 
* Days 6: Take bus and hiking - Untersberg
* Day 7: Take train ride from Salzburg to Innsbruck, hang out for the day. 
* Day 8: Hiking - Wolfsklamm Gorge
* Day 9: Hiking - Otzal Valley
* Days 10 - Take train to Garmisch Partenkirchen
* Day 11: Hiking - Zugspitze
* Day 12: Train from Garmisch Partenkirchen to Munich
* Day 13: Hang out in Munich for the day.
* Day 14: Fly to Dublin and return home.

Please let me know your recommendations for the places/hikes I listed above! Is it far too many hikes? I plan on doing a balance of easy and more difficult hikes in each of the areas mentioned. I’m also still on the fence about Garmisch Partenkirchen!

1jt3067,reddit,Malaysia - convince me to go to KK or Penang instead of Langkawi,"We're planning a trip to Malaysia, 7D6N in KL and 5D4N at a beach resort. We have two kids, 5 yo and 3yo. Our requirements are pretty simple - we mostly want to relax at the resort, go into town here and there, and only a couple of outings/excursions that the kids can enjoy. We've been to Penang once (without kids) and Langkawi three times (twice with kids), and contrary to the sentiment on this and other subs we found Langkawi much more fun and relaxing. I'll say that our Penang trip was probably not well planned, we stayed at Shangri-La which was not close to Georgetown and we found our beach to be quite busy because of the amount of water sports being run nearby. In Langkawi we stayed along Cenang Beach, we weren't bothered that it was the most touristy part of the island and appreciated being walking distance from convenience stores, restaurants and local shopping. We have no experience with Kota Kinabalu, the beaches and resorts look fantastic (considering Shangri-La Rasa Ria) but the nearby activities/excursions don't seem to be little kid friendly. I'm not sure if Grab operates in Sabah, would be a bummer if not because when the kids got bored of resort food we could always order mcdonalds/kfc/burger king to the resort.

So the easy choice for us is Langkawi because it's a known quantity that the kids enjoyed a lot and there's more to do that we didn't get to in the last two trips. But we also want to try somewhere new, so either giving Penang another shot or doing something new for all of us like KK. We did consider places like Tioman and Perhentian but getting there will be torture for the kids and eat a bigger chunk out of our allotted time to travel. Am I missing any other options in Malaysia? I know people have strong opinions against Langkawi, but we wouldn't lose any sleep choosing it over other options.  Would appreciate if people with similar aged kids can share experiences in Penang and KK that would help us make our decision.
