VietNam,1k3t4vp,mo74x7w,"Im giving you a good solo trip for seeing a lot of vietnam: 

Day 1: Fly to Hanoi, visit museums and mausoleum (eat bun cha, pho, banh mi, drink mango smoothies)

Day 2: tour to ninh binh, water puppet in hanoi at evening

Day 3: tour to halong bay, in evening walk around old quarter, go to the train spot to see train pass close to you. Nice video and pics

Day 4: Fly to danang in the morning, visit temples, then take taxi to HOI AN in the afternoon to visit the old town and take a little boat cruise. After dinner and everything closes, take taxi back to danang

Day 5: daytour to hue with imperial city and tombs and pagoda, chill at beach in danang in evening. Buy seafood dinner in danang

Day 6: Fly to ho chi minh city from danang. Walk around, visit museums and palace. In afternoon around 5pm go to landmark 81 tower (or bitexco tower) to go to the top and enjoy the view of the city with sunset. Then in evening can do a cruise + dinner or take a night hop-on, hop-off tourbus around the city (visits all landmarks, but cant hop off). End the evening at Buy vien party street. 

Day 7: if your flight is late in evening, then do a daytour to mekong delta, if not, then enjoy ho chi minh city and fly home.

Tips: 
- install grab and only get taxi through this. Cheapest and trusted

- get a physical sim at the airport so you dont have to worry about internet. It's more expensive than in the city, but its still cheap (13usd instead of 8 usd), try to get the viettal 5g (vodaphone fine too), the one inside the airport near the exit is where I bought mine

- use vietjetair for planes within vietnam, use 12go asia for busses if you prefer overnight bus.

- for daytours use getyourguide or klook, its usually very cheap (except halong bay) so its nice if you give a tip afterwards. 100-200k but not required. Depends on you and how good the guide was

- get cash from atms, don't use exchanges. There's tons everywhere. If atm asks to do conversion, press no. If you can find an atm from shinhan its good because doesn't ask any transaction fee. Other banks 1 to 5 dollar 

- People will ask you to buy things even if you're just sitting at a café and enjoying a drink. Don't be rude or get annoyed, they don't earn much and they already deal with rejection all day everyday. Prices are cheap too, so if you see something you need you can buy

- small shops will count on you to haggle, but don't be a douche for a few cents.. a dollar to you is a lot less than to them. 

- have fun, be nice, don't get annoyed, be aware of culture shock, careful when crossing the road, male solo travelers will get asked by prostitutes.. Just say no thanks and move along. Drugs and prostitution are illegal on paper.

I loved Hà Nội. It’s the marmite capital if Vietnam if you go by Reddit alone, totally polarising views. I loved the coffee culture and the chaos and the food and connecting with local folk. 

Hoi An I liked but it was very busy and lantern boats not my jam. Some good tailors but a lot of poor quality ones now. You need to go there with trusted recommendations. An Bang beach I thought was fine and you can get a sun lounger for much much cheaper than you would in Nha Trang! 

Ninh Binh, Sapa and Ha Giang- out of these three that I visited, Ha Giang loop was my favourite. The views you can get (on a clear day) are nothing short of spectacular. Ninh Binh was nice to chill after the loop. Sapa trek- only do this if the weather is good/has been good the previous few days because the treks can be treacherous in the mud. Multiple injuries in our group! But I think at least two days trek is good.

All the locations you have mentioned are great, and not too far from each other, I would add Hue if possible, it has lots to see and do: the old citadel, the dragon theme abadoned park, etc. Da Nang has Marble Mountain with big caves and a great view, beautiful beaches and a big Buddha with monkeys around it, etc.

Some also go tits for tats. Like previously when they wed, the bride or groom give a certain amount, then they will return the same amount without interest.

If you want to use the wedding as a bribe opportunity, then the amount given depends on the expected favour you want to get from the wedding people (bride,groom, parents of). You know they'll open the envelop and record the amount and the sender there.

Then you have vegetarian tourist restaurants that will probably cater more to your taste with tofu and vegetables. More expensive but some of them are really amazing and often it's the only option.

3. Ya, you can. I just book hostel or hotel when I reach that city, village. No paying first so you can cancel booking easily.

Plane and a taxi/private car into the city. The drive to Da Lat would take 6 hours disregarding any stops you might want to take. For adults it's ""ok"" but not sure how your young children would like sitting in the small car for several hours.

>2. When in Dalat, what would be the best mode of transportation we can take if we have a baby.

Car. Either Grab or ask your accommodation to hire a driver for the day(s).

>I’ve read we can rent motorbikes but we are not good drivers 😬

You mentioning this while having a baby and admitting you're not good drivers is crazy.

>3. What is the weather in Dalat on first week if August?

Rainy season and showers here and there. Check the weather forecast closer to date.

>4. Is 3 days 2 nights enough to go around Dalat?

As a tourist it's fine depending on what you'd like to do.

**Day 1**

Arrival. Taking it easy by just doing the tourist-y things around the city. Cafe/Food hopping, flower park, night market etc.

**Day 2**

If you manage to get a driver, some things outside the city. Various man-made tourist attractions, the zoo, larger flower parks, waterfalls might be too much for the little ones.

Hiring a taxi would be a good choice and allow you to take it at your pace. It takes about 6 hours by car, not stopping much. Fourth minutes flight time. You can get Lado taxi for a reduce rate to DL, some 160k vnd.
As for transportation in DL, I always recommend not driving a motorbike even if you’re experienced. The problem is medical care should you get in an accident. I own a restaurant and cannot tell you how many of our customers get in accident. Walk or take a taxi. You can get across the entire city in about 8 minutes.

Sapa is such a unique place – both in terms of nature and culture. Be sure to try some local dishes specific to the region.

The next day, we headed to Fansipan around 11 am. We really wanted a good rest, so we didn’t want to set off too early – and going before lunchtime felt like perfect timing. We spent around four hours there, then went for a walk around the rice terraces. If you’re not too tired, I’d recommend visiting Cat Cat Village, as it’s on the same side of town. If you can get there before sunset, when all the lights come on, it should look absolutely stunning (we did Cat Cat in the morning next day).

On our final day, we booked a private car tour that covered a range of sights and was super convenient. We had a local guide who took us to Cat Cat Village first, then on to two other local villages. We walked through rice terraces, visited two waterfalls, and stopped at several beautiful viewpoints. It worked really well for us – my husband can’t manage long walks, and with the heat and sun, I was quite glad to be doing it all by car instead. Even in March we had temperatures going up to +32C during the day. 

I know it might not be the kind of experience you’re looking for, but if you’re up for trekking, you won’t have any trouble finding a guide – lots of local women offer various tours. We did consider a homestay, but in the end opted for a lovely hotel. The views from our balcony were incredible, and overall, I felt much more comfortable with that setup.",1,2025-04-05 22:13:58,OpenFalcon6111

For 1-1.5 day stay in Sa Pa which places would you recommend- we are visiting next week.

VietNam,1jrxfxz,mli8uqu,Vietnam use 220v and 50Hz. So no question on the outlet. The outlet may have US or EU style but never UK style unless in highend hotels. Philipines uses 220v too so at least your device won't blow up when plugin here. I think recent charger would work because they're designed to work with multiple voltage and frequency and the output is also negotiated with the PD technology/protocol.,4,2025-04-05 07:12:08,TallRent8080

VietNam,1jraagq,mld33ok,"The proper looking sit-down restaurants may be more likely to give you for poisoning, in particular if they have a long menu. 

Pick places to eat that have a place to properly clean dishes (i.e. not a bucket on the side of a street) or uses disposable dishes, has a very short menu (preferably one option) and is busy/popular (guarantees it was made fresh).",15,2025-04-04 12:25:19,cdifl

There are two different things we call “food poisoning.” The first is when food has actually spoiled; that can be more serious. The more common one for tourists is usually an imbalance of bacteria, something in the local water or food that gets into your gut and reproduces like crazy till your body (and other gut flora) adjust. It’s “less serious” because you adjust and get through it, but it can make for a miserable few days.",5,2025-04-04 15:56:06,ThatWeirdPlantGuy

In many parts of Vietnam stalls and coffee shops still buy their ice from solid blocks that are driven all over the city on the back of a motorbike, then put on the sidewalk and cut into smaller pieces to be sold to shops.

If you want ice, make your own by drinking 2/3 of water then freeze the rest.
