Nintendo has been chokeholding us on prices ever since the Switch and Switch Lite came out. Those games were 60 on launch, and are still 60 to this fucking day

Nintendo shouldn't 'aDjUsT pRiCeS' because they've been scamming us for years now. Between mediocre Pokémon games, a new mainline Mario game that went as fast as it came, Zelda games that seem to be the only thing they actually put effort into, and so much shovelware you'd think it was a hardware store, Nintendo has basically been rolling in the fucking dough.

Not to mention, with all the Amiibo's, DLC's, paid subscriptions, games that REQUIRE those paid subscriptions and console accessories, they've made enough money with the first two that it shouldn't justify these fucking prices",2025-04-04 17:15:38,10,Starchaser53,memes

The new Mario Kart is $80 because Nintendo thought they would make more money that way. Yes it's true that they have their reasons, but they still weren't forced to up the price.

Equally, if you think it's shitty of Nintendo to sell the game for $80, you need to learn how a corporation works. Their first priority will always be to make money, and there's nothing ""immoral"" about that unless they're firing tons of people or using AI or some shit.

I'm glad that pre-orders got cancelled, because you shouldn't pre-order video games anyway. Stop treating Nintendo as your friend or your enemy, *wait for reviews to come out* and decide for yourself whether it's worth the money.",2025-04-04 19:30:20,4,Mogoscratcher,memes

The original Mario kart was similarly priced at $55 in 1993, or 121 adjusted for inflation to 2024 dollars. 




Mario kart 64 released in 1996 at 60 dollars. That's 121 in 2025 dollars.

Quotes from studio about the name

> The atmosphere left Sakaguchi doubting the potential of the game, thinking that the game wouldn’t sell thanks the shortage of staff and other factors. The series name, Final Fantasy, is often attributed to Square’s dependence on the product as its last throw of the dice – but the truth, says Sakaguchi, was that it was his personal last effort.

> “The name ‘Final Fantasy’ was a display of my feeling that if this didn’t sell, I was going to quit the games industry and go back to university. I’d have had to repeat a year, so I wouldn’t have had any friends – it really was a ‘final’ situation.”",2025-03-31 15:34:17,60,stevarisimp,memes

For school, I was reading a book about a gifted boy from a poor(ish) family who somehow got accepted to a boarding school and became friends with a more rebellious boy. It's from a German post world war 2 author and it's very boring. 

At one point in the book, I believe the kid was fishing at a lake or so and the author just went on and on and on about describing the grass and a tree or something like that. He probably thought he was Tolkien or so. I glanced one or two pages ahead and noticed that he was STILL describing the leaves and weeds and so on. 

I don't remember if I actually just skipped ahead to when the narrative progressed, but I know for sure that it wouldn't have made a difference because I can't remember anything from that lake today.",2025-04-09 08:28:33,2,TheGukos,memes

2) is planning to shoot her shot with someone eelse's and wants to keep you as a backup

3) is unsure about what to do and needs time to think it over

If it's the first one, she's probably worth a shot. If it's the second one, bite the bullet and don't become a backup boyfriend. You'll risk getting discarded as soon as another option comes along. The third one is kinda a grey area, it mostly depends on whether the uncertainty stems from you or her.

Use words that people actually know (to not sound like a tryhard) in place of common words. Instead of ""genuinely"" or ""actually"" say something like ""truly"". Or take example from some of the other words mentioned here, they are sarcastic for the most part, but effective if you don't overdo them. Do not use contractions if you are writing an important paper/document. Be concise when you need to, but for emotional impact you should extend your sentences instead of using harsh language (that is, if you want to avoid harsh language). 

There's really no need to do that though when you're out and about. But if you want to build a habit, or you're writing an important email/document, definitely make sure you know how to sound professional and mature. It's a useful life skill.",2025-04-05 22:24:56,2,Peridact,memes

Botanists will say that tomatoes are fruits because they are the reproductive organs of the plant which we eat. 

However, vegetables are botanically defined as any edible part of the plant, which means fruits are vegetables. Squares are rectangles but rectangles aren't squares type shit.

mkl7evh,1jndlm4,reddit," I want to add that pumpkins, squash, cucumbers, peppers, eggplants, and nuts are also all fruits. Eggplants, potatoes, and tomatoes are all closely related (in the genus solanum). Peppers, deadly nightshade, and tobacco are also closely related (solanaceae). Each “seed” on a strawberry is an individual fruit with the fleshy red part we eat being an accessory fruit. A single pineapple or fig is actually many fruits fused together called a “multiple fruit”. oranges, grapefruits, and lemons weren’t naturally occurring citruses but made from crosses of some other citrus plants (citron, pomelos, and mandarins). Most of the fleshy part of apple isn’t part of the fruit but rather derived from the thalamus of the flower, the hard part we refer to as the core is actually the fruit derived from the ovary.

\-Van Gogh cut his ear after going insane by not being able to replicate the exact details in the muscles of the muscle mommy he was painting.

\-Einstein hit repeatedly his head against the tree because he was impotent after mathematically failling to compare the relative gravitational power between a chubby girl in cowgirl pose VS an muscle mommy in amazon pose...and then that apple felt on his head and decided to think about other thing before going insane.",2025-04-05 04:01:24,1,darkargengamer,memes

They're the only console maker making cheap consoles designed to be used with friends and family, and their cheap prices ensured that, even with poorer performances than Sony or Microsoft. Trying to enter the market of high cost high performances consoles will only give them a smaller piece of the pie, as Sony and Microsoft are already well-established and now Nintendo is basically giving up on the cheap and family oriented platform market, where they had basically no competitors. And especially for an improvement of their last console... as a Nintendo fan I'm feeling Wii-U vibes. Costly, uninnovative and relying on Nintendo IPs to sell.",2025-04-03 15:16:42,58,RaphyyM,memes

2. The regular switch cartridges were already reported to cost a lot more to make than regular CDs. I am not sure what adding faster processing speeds and data storage does to the cost but I’m assuming that’s why the price went up. 

I understand why the price went up, but they just raised it to $70 and I figured that would stay for many years. Raising it another $10 to $80 makes the previous price spike a lie. Instead of a $60->$80 jump they tried to hide it behind a $60 -> $70 for a year -> $80… and that’s extremely scummy",2025-04-03 20:02:26,1,Hephaestus_God,memes

mkxusua,1joj576,reddit,"I speak from experience...  
  
Permitting children to freely indulge in gaming and other excessive forms of entertainment without discipline is not exercising true care but rather negligence disguised as permissiveness.  
  
Such children, devoid of structure and the ability to self-regulate, grow into adults ill-equipped to face the demands of reality, having spent their formative years immersed in fleeting digital gratification instead of cultivating discipline, resilience, and critical thinking. In time, they will find that the world is neither as forgiving nor as accommodating as their childhood escapism led them to believe, and their struggle to adapt will be the direct consequence of parental failure masked as love.

TLDR... Responsibility should always be prioritized when educating children otherwise, parents risk raising a manchild devoid of discipline and self actualization. It's not ""cool"" in the long run.

mondnmu,1k5z237,reddit,"From the Red Rising Wiki page;

>The pitvipers of the mines are thick black snakes that can grow to be as ""wide as a thigh and the length of three men"".

>Originally from Earth like all flora and fauna, they mutated in the deep tunnels of Mars. They are capable of biting through a frysuit. Not only that, but they have a strong poison that will either kill those too weak to resist it, or strengthen the heart of the one bitten. The potent poison cannot be sucked out of a bite. The pitviper is one thing that evokes fear in many Helldivers.
