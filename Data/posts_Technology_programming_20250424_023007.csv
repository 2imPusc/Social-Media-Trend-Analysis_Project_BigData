I’m excited to share `gen-express-cli` – a CLI tool that now supports Express 5! Quickly scaffold an Express 5 project, so you can jump straight into coding without the boilerplate hassle.

Why you’ll love it:

Instant Setup: Generate a ready-to-go Express project with a single command.

Customizable: Easily tailor the scaffolded code to fit your project needs (ESM, typescript, jest ...)

Fast & Lightweight: Focus on building your app instead of dealing with setup.

Grab it on npm with:

```
npx gen-express-cli@latest
```

For more details, check out the GitHub repo: [gen-express-cli](https://github.com/RulerChen/gen-express-cli). If you like it, please give it a star!",0,0.33,0,2025-04-11 23:34:55,https://github.com/RulerChen/gen-express-cli,Rulerchen

programming,1jo3lnz,Lessons from Rollbar on how to improve (10x to 20x faster) large dataset query speeds with Clickhouse and mySQL,"At Rollbar, we recently completed a significant overhaul of our Item Search backend. The previous system faced performance limitations and constraints on search capabilities. This post details the technical challenges, the architectural changes we implemented, and the resulting performance gains.

Overhauling a core feature like search is a significant undertaking. By analyzing bottlenecks and applying specialized data stores (optimized MySQL for item data state, Clickhouse for occurrence data with real-time merge mappings), we dramatically improved search speed, capability, accuracy, and responsiveness for core workflows. These updates not only provide a much better user experience but also establish a more robust and scalable foundation for future enhancements to Rollbar's capabilities.

This initiative delivered substantial improvements:

* **Speed:** Overall search performance is typically 10x to 20x faster. Queries that previously timed out (>60s) now consistently return in roughly 1-2 seconds. Merging items now reflects in search results within seconds, not 20 minutes.
* **Capability:** Dozens of new occurrence fields are available for filtering and text matching. Custom key/value data is searchable.
* **Accuracy:** Time range filtering and sorting are now accurate, reflecting actual occurrences. Total occurrence counts and unique IP counts are accurate.
* **Reliability:** Query timeouts are drastically reduced.

📦 GitHub: [https://github.com/geiger01/puppeteer-lambda](https://github.com/geiger01/puppeteer-lambda)

It’s a minimal setup with:

* Puppeteer bundled and ready to run inside Lambda
* `chrome-aws-lambda` support
* Simple example handler for extracting HTML

I use this setup in **my side projects**, and it’s worked well so far for handling headless Chromium tasks without managing servers.

programming,1jybljz,"Coding in MiniScript Feels Like Python or Lua – Simple, Clean, and Fun","I've been experimenting with [MiniScript](https://miniscript.org/) recently, and I have to say—it's surprisingly enjoyable. If you're into lightweight, clean scripting languages like Python or Lua, you'll probably feel right at home. The syntax is super minimal, and yet it’s powerful enough to build full games.

What really makes it shine is using it with [Mini Micro](https://miniscript.org/MiniMicro/) — a tiny virtual machine for making retro-style games. It genuinely feels like coding on an old-school computer from the 80s or 90s, but with modern comforts (like instant code reloads and visual feedback). Perfect for prototyping ideas or just having fun with game dev in a nostalgic way.

It’s honestly refreshing to work in such a small, focused environment. If you're tired of bloated engines or just want to mess around with a simpler toolset, I highly recommend checking it out. Also, you can use it for game jams!

Disclaimer: It's not self-promotion, [Miniscript](https://miniscript.org/) is made by Joe Strout, and I am just sharing my experience, its really fun :)

Anyone else tried it? Or have you used similar minimalist tools for game dev?

Some more game examples:

programming,1jr931k,Fine-tune LLaVA on Custom Datasets Using NVIDIA Brev,"A few months ago I discovered [NVIDIA Brev](https://developer.nvidia.com/brev), a super useful resource for those of us who train large AI models and need access to powerful GPUs. Brev allows you to connect to a variety of cloud GPUs from your own computer.

They have some coding tutorials on what can be done by connecting to these GPUs, however, these tutorials are not regularly updated.

I began working on their [LLaVA fine-tuning tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XICHJx2_Rm8) and unfortunately ran into many problems and errors along the way because of dependency issues, GPU memory issues, and more.

In this article I will show you how you can ***successfully*** fine-tune LLaVA on a custom dataset using Brev.",0,0.13,0,2025-04-04 10:57:38,https://medium.com/@tesswatt/fine-tune-llava-on-custom-dataset-using-nvidia-brev-c2b720b88802,Quiet-Tail-4213

programming,1joouuj,An older techie here reflecting on how to thrive and survive with fast changes in IT. My reflections on mainframes & 25 years after Y2K,"Technology grounding in the basics and the basic principles are what you continue to build on as we grow and thrive

* OLTP vs. Batch Processing
   * Online Transaction Processing (OLTP): Managed real-time user interactions via screens, developed using CICS and IMS.
   * Batch Processing: Handled bulk data operations, processing large files, datasets, and databases. Jobs were scheduled using JCL and managed by job schedulers.
* Data Interchange - Initially relied on batch transfers, FTP, and EDIs for machine-to-machine communication.
* Evolved into API gateways, XML messaging (XMS), and modern EDIs for faster, more dynamic data exchange.
* Reporting & Analytics - Early systems ingested large datasets into reporting databases, which later evolved into data warehouses and data marts for structured analytics.
* Security - Early mainframes used RACF (Resource Access Control Facility) for strong authentication and authorization .",0,0.22,0,2025-04-01 06:15:06,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2EAw1y-kWA,Lifecoach_411

programming,1k43jpg,A browser-based text editor optimized for ease of reading (on Github),"Many years ago, when I had a between-jobs stint, I wrote a new kind of text editor as a desktop app (https://jm21.s3.amazonaws.com/spectral/spectral\_whitepaper.pdf), which I find very useful for dealing with legacy code. Recently, following another round of redundancy, and there being a gap till the next joining date, I have tried to port some of the features of Spectral desktop to a self-contained browser-based interface, mostly using ChatGPT. It is very simple to use and hopefully simple to extend. I am leaving the github link here, in case someone finds it useful. Here is a slightly dated demo (some more features have been added since this was recorded):
