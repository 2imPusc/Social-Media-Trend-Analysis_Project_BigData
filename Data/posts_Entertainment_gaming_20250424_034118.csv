gaming,1jvzk0p,My wife thinks video games are juvenile and playing them makes me less attractive.,"42M here. I've been playing video games all my life, in many different genres, from Civilization to Warcraft to Wolfenstein 3D to Halo to Half Life to Fallout to Fornite to Red Dead Redemption to The Witcher to Cyberpunk 2077 and many in between. My wife knew this shortly after we met and of course when we got married. She had always said that she doesn't ""get them"" or understand why anyone would want to play them but she understood that it was something I found relaxing and enjoyable.

Fast forward to this week and she flat out tells me (while we were arguing about something else) that she thinks video games are juvenile, she can't believe that a 42 year old man plays them, and that playing them makes me less attractive to her. For reference, I'm a manager at work, we have a nice house, four kids and 2 dogs. So it's not like I'm just bumming around. And I take care of my hygiene and appearance  - basically I don't fall into any of the negative gamer stereotypes. I also play when everyone else is asleep so it's not cutting into family or housework time. It does mean that I tend to sleep in on weekend mornings though, which she doesn't like, as she's more of a morning person.

Does anyone have any good advice here? Is there any hope of her changing how she feels? She knows that some of them are very much not for kids and that it's a bigger industry than movies, but it doesn't change how she feels. Should I give up gaming? That would feel like a huge sacrifice but would probably have big benefits. Or do we just live with this?

What to do... 

Edit: RIP my inbox.

Edit2: Holy crap. I really tried to keep up, but there have been 14 thousand comments in 14 hours. I might check a few more but there's no way I can read them all. Thankyou for those that added insightful, challenging comments. Thanks less to those who proposed divorce or assumed I was lying. Yes, there are likely underlying issues for both of us, and we need to work on our communication. Yes, r/gaming is biased and perhaps a strange place to post, but it's been worthwhile. Thanks. 

For reference: Our kids are 11, 13, 15 & 16. When I get up at 10am, they are either still asleep, gaming, or YouTubing. I start playing on Friday and Saturday nights (if we're not going out) once jobs are done and kids are in bed, which is usually between 10pm and 12am. I finish between 2 and 3am.

So I put on the jar helm, took off my armour and haven’t stopped helping others since. 😊

I never expected this to come so far, but I just truly enjoyed helping each and every single person, and I always pushed myself to be better; not for me, but for them.

I encountered so many incredible people along the way and found that the elden ring and fromsoft community is really one of a kind. Their appreciation; kindness and support kept me going all this time

So I just want to say thankyou to everyone, truly. It has been such an honour being a part of so many peoples journeys.

It means so much to me.

gaming,1jpucx4,Please people just be smart for ONCE and don't let Nintendo ruin the entire industry by buying a damn digital game for 80 DOLLARS,"I swear to god, if you all do this say hello to the mythical $100 price for GTA6. And you'll deserve that pain for backing up this kind of BS from Nintendo. Cause if they pull it off, others will follow.

*edit:* for the love of god, get a better damn cope than ""inflation"" 

a game will sell well if it's a good game, and the devs / publishers will get their investment back and more in no time if it's good to the people who buy. A great example since you all wanna talk expensive shit, RDR2 estimated budget including marketing was around $550 million, they got a profit of over $700 million **in the first 3 days of launch**, like I said, if a game is good, and it's good to it's players *even with the price*, it will be successful. I can't honestly believe you're all backing up the company that dicks over their own fanbases for the most insane reasons, and it's now at the edge of changing the industry for the worse. I get that Nintendo does good and talented stuff, there's no doubt about that, but this change they are pushing will only give you shit AAA games **from other companies** at worse prices if you let them get away with this.  
  
It's already bad enough that there are morons out there buying ""Deluxe Editions"" for over $100 *(that don't even come with real stuff to at least display on a shelf.)*",37551,0.79,5845,2025-04-02 17:26:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1jpucx4/please_people_just_be_smart_for_once_and_dont_let/,Timeless_Starman

\- Valorant: The shittiest fucking BP ever that Im forced to buy for radianite. Can take well over 1 hour daily to do the Daily mission. It usually leaves me so burned out that I tend to take a break from the game after I finish a Bp.

\- TFT: decent BP, no daily bs, only weekly and seasonal that you can complete as you play. No complain tbh.

\- Fortnite: plenty of time, 0 thinking and you can afk farm with exp maps easily. The golden standard for bp.

\- Frag Punk last month that thankfully I only needed to play 2 games to complete daily.

My point is: Fuck you valorant and fuck time sensitive battle passes. I enjoy the value battle passes bring but I think we are due to buy the bp once and being yours forever until you complete it.

If I ""have"" to play your game even if Im not feeling like it, Im gonna start hating your game.

gaming,1jo7swh,The seasons changing in Shadows is a great RPG mechanic,"Game: Assassin's Creed: Shadows 

I spent about 50 hrs visiting all the viewpoints before starting the MQ in Shadows and it took about 2 in-game years.

I've never thought, ""I've come a long way in a couple of years"" in an RPG before and I think it'd be a stellar mechanic to adopt in other titles.

It's not a perfect system - you can manually set the season forward or it'll automatically change with fast travel, but it gave a unique sense of depth to those first 50 hours. 

I wasn't expecting this mechanic to give weight to the passage of time but it  felt like Naoe was more *seasoned* after I was done traveling to every viewpoint. 

Would love to see the seasons change in a more traditional sword and sorcery RPG setting.

gaming,1jv0frk,"'There is no lawsuit' against Schedule I: As negative Steam reviews pile up, Drug Dealer Simulator publisher makes a public plea for peace","Dear Gamers,
We’d like to address your Schedule I / Drug Dealer Simulator publication and share some facts regarding the situation.

1. There is no lawsuit. 2. It is not our intention to prevent TVGS from selling or developing their game. 3. There is an investigation into the nature of similarities between the games since a preliminary legal analysis indicated there might have been an infringement. 4. The analysis and investigation were necessary in the light of repeating opinions that the games are very similar. By not investigating it, Movie Games, being a publicly traded company, could face severe consequences for negligence. 5. The above was communicated only via ESPI, a stock market communication system, where we are obligated to publish such information for full transparency. Not publishing it would also be a case of negligence. From there it was picked up by the media and, in some cases, wrongly reported as a lawsuit. 6. The above is handled only by Movie Games, the publisher, not Byterunners, the developer of Drug Dealer Simulator. The developer is not involved in it whatsoever.

There is no ill will towards TVGS. We even mailed them best wishes shortly before the release, when the game was already huge, but before the investigation was deemed necessary. However, we are obligated to perform this investigation, act accordingly to the scope of the infringement if it is confirmed, and inform the public about it via ESPI.
Best wishes, Movie Games",7302,0.96,503,2025-04-09 07:58:16,https://www.pcgamer.com/games/there-is-no-lawsuit-against-schedule-i-as-negative-steam-reviews-pile-up-drug-dealer-simulator-publisher-makes-a-public-plea-for-peace/,Busy-Reality-1580

Do you think open world games are becoming too bloated?

In reality, it feels mostly just the same.. No way we were getting past 9pm or 10pm curfew as kids without getting scolded so we probably had at max 5-10 hours of free gaming time per day.

For example I made it to chapter 5 in Black Myth Wukong and stopped playing for a few months and want to jump back into it but don’t want to jump into my old game even though it will take me dozens of hours to get to where I was. Wanted to know if anyone else experiences this and what causes it. ,3880,0.97,539,2025-04-10 20:39:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1jw871p/i_always_feel_like_i_have_to_completely_restart_a/,N/A

gaming,1jlbhka,"The first time I beat a game as a kid, I thought it was broken.","I was probably 7 or 8, playing *Spyro* on my cousin’s PlayStation. I beat the final boss, and suddenly… the credits rolled. I legit thought I messed something up. I remember restarting the console like three times, thinking I missed something. I had no idea games actually *ended*.

Before that, every game I’d played was either endless (like *Tetris*) or I just… never got far enough to finish. It blew my mind that a game could *end* — like, that’s it? You’re done?

Now I kinda miss that feeling. When finishing a game wasn’t just a checklist item, but this weird, unexpected surprise.

Anyone else remember the first time they beat a game and had no idea what to do next? Or was that just me?",3716,0.96,175,2025-03-27 18:51:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1jlbhka/the_first_time_i_beat_a_game_as_a_kid_i_thought/,itswickedbby

Although we don't have raw numbers from the wall yet link the link it's still a big enough disparity to make the dock fan requirement make sense. It sounds like they're pushing that handheld chip to it's limits in docked mode.,1817,0.93,265,2025-04-04 14:31:01,https://i.redd.it/gubm4ka0wtse1.jpeg,bobmlord1

gaming,1joeflb,What's a game that's somewhat easy to 100%/Platinum... except for that ONE trophy,"my mind immediately goes to Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus.

for the other trophies, it's just, ""Oh, play the game, collect these things, do this stuff, and you're good to go."" You can replay missions and get whatever you missed, even being able to keep all your cool stuff when you do so. Fun times all around.

and then there's Mein Leben. Same difficulty as the previous one, I Am Death Incarnate!, except you only have one life and you have to beat the game in one sitting. No saves.

This trophy feels like I'm receiving testicular torsion straight from Satan himself, and the Doom Slayer isn't around to help. This shit requires you to replay the game on IADI! multiple times, but it will never be enough. This shit makes me want to learn coding to develop a way to mod my PS5 and give myself cheats. This shit is the only obstacle between me wanting to platinum my entire\* library and just not doing it. Whoever designed this difficulty hates you, your family, your children, your ancestors, your descendants, your dogs, your cats, and everything you interact with.

To anyone wanting to platinum this game, I have three words:

Fuck. This. Trophy",1538,0.92,778,2025-03-31 21:16:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1joeflb/whats_a_game_thats_somewhat_easy_to_100platinum/,HF484
