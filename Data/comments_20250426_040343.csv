mlg8qwg,1jro1ng,reddit,"I like to think that the first movie I saw in my life was 2001: A Space Odyssey. That probably is too neat to be true, but it's true-ish: I think I was about 6 or 7 (?) then, and for a long time we didn't have a TV, and for a long time I didn't see anything other than cartoons. This was definitely the first adult movie I watched from start to finish and I don't have clear memories of the movies I definitely saw before that.

I sort of knew about space from picture books and my kids encyclopedia, and I liked drawing planets and all the aliens that according to me lived there, so I was more or less on the right wavelength. 2001 is sometimes criticized for the lack of human element and for the shallow characters, but that actually helped me get into it: any kind of complex psychological exploration of whatever definitely would have bored me to tears, but the pretty spaceships flying in space did not.

I remember being really impressed by the special effect of the stewardess walking up the wall in zero g, I thought it was incredibly neat, and I also remember that during the scene where we see HAL's POV of the character's lips as it's doing the lip-reading, I thought the TV set must have broken, because there was no sound. (Serious lack of ""media literacy"" as we say in the year of our lord 2025.) The movie was keeping me engaged - I most certainly had never seen visuals like those before, anywhere, but I wasn't really having my mind blown - I just thought it was pretty good, and I was definitely disappointed we didn't get to see the aliens, preferably with lots of tentacles, like in my drawings. I liked it more than grandma did though, who thought it was pretty pointless. For years afterwards I thought of 2001 as that one old movie I saw once as a kind that was decent and it was a little strange to hear that it was supposed to be the be-all, end-all of film-making.",2025-04-04 22:24:14,3,_Pit_Man,movies

He gets a phone call, and goes upstairs to take it. That happens before Carol Anne even says “they’re here”. Not long after, my brothers decide that they don’t want to watch this, so they go up to my room to watch Sky High on my TV (it had a dvd player built into it). 

I didn’t want my dad to be disappointed if he came downstairs and found out that we had all left, so I stayed.

There is so much humanity and truth in the film... too much for me to take in after a single viewing. It *is* bleak, but it's also absurd, hilarious, and, to me, reassuring and cautiously hopeful. Llewyn's arc is so real to me because he doesn't know how to deal with everything that's happened and loses all hope, and through the course of the movie he never learns how to deal with anything. Instead, he just comes to terms with the fact that he feels the way he feels, and re-engages with things he ran away from. He accepts uncertainty. None of us know how to deal with new experiences, and the only way we can ever know is by allowing ourselves to feel however we feel.

mnxpf25,1k2vs7j,reddit,"Sci-Fi:   
Event Horizon - I think there's maybe one jump scare in the whole thing, the rest is mostly very unnerving horror.  
  
Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978) - If you can go into this movie knowing nothing about it, do that. No jump scares, just purely unnerving. 

The Thing (1982) - I think there are maybe two or three jump scares in this. The majority of the film relies on psychological horror and distrust between characters. Geniunely a good watch.

Cult-Hits:  
It Follows - The idea behind it sounds ridiculous, sexually transmitted monster. But there is a lot of geniunely good moments in this film. The whole thing really hits you right in the uncanny valley vibes and there's never a jump scare in the whole thing. I was pleasantly surprised by this film.

Pontypool - Do not look up anything about this movie. Go into it blind. The only thing you need to safely know about this film is that it is a zombie flick.

Asian Films:   
Ju-On - The original Japanese Grudge movie. If you've seen the American version, trust me when I say these are not the same. Ju-On is legitimately so much better in every way. The ambiance, the story telling, it's all just better. Japanese ghost horror in general is so uniquely different from a lot of Western ghost horror. Not that Western ghost horror is bad, but there's a lot of stuff that culturally got lost in translation between the Ju-On and The Grudge because they had to change things to make it more relatable to American audiances. 

Perfect Blue - If you're not against watching anime, Perfect Blue is probably one of the best Psychological horror films I have ever watched. No jump scares. The tension is real in this film. Warning though: there is a sexually violent scene in this film that is really hard to watch. It's completely skippable, as it adds very little to the character's trauma that the rest of the film doesn't already contribute to more signficantly.

Train to Busan - Probably the best zombie film in the modern day. This movie has everything a natural disaster/zombie film should have. Human trauma, struggle and people you can root for. The flow of this film is so good.

\#ALIVE - Another Korean zombie film, not related at all to Train to Busan. I'll admit, the pacing for this one is kind of slow but the relatability is what makes this movie. 

Psychological Horror:  
The Invisible Man (2020) - Do not watch this movie if you have been a victim of Domestic Violence and Stalking, it will trigger some serious PTSD. Aside from that, this movie is geniunely good in so many ways. The way it captures very real horror of domestic violence and combines that with the classic horror elements of the Invisible Man troupe is pure genius. The acting is fantastic as well. It's hard to understate how well this movie came together to be truly horrifying without all the pit falls of most modern horror films.

Hide and Seek (2005) - I remember this movie getting a lot of flak back in the day and I'm not sure how well it ages, cause to be honest with you I haven't watched this movie in a minute. But I remember liking this movie a lot when it came out. It was geniunely strange, the acting from Robert Di Nero and Dakota Fanning is legitimately good. It might be a little predictable but it was fun watching it unfold.

Heretic - This move was better than I thought it was going to be. I love Hugh Grant but I had my doubts about him being in a horror film, and I'm glad I was wrong. It's very prominently religious horror though, so it may not be for everyone.",2025-04-19 14:59:42,2,AageRaghnall,movies

mnx99jd,1k2ingl,reddit,"I love Only Lovers Left Alive. I only watched it a couple of years ago and I did not expect to love it so much. It was hilariously funny in places. I am glad people are now finding their way to it.

You are absolutely correct and I would love to see Tom and Tilda again soon. It was just a perfect couple, like....she knew who he was and he knew who she was, knew each other´s flaws. you could tell she WAS older (actress and the character)  but they matched because he was this melancholic soul who loved the same things she did. They were comfortable together, despite living in opposite sides of the world.

And the movie did not have much of a plot, really, except the middle part. You just follow them driving, talking, dancing and it is enough. You absolutely need actors with sparkling and natural chemistry for that.

If I should stick to Tom Hiddleston so I totally did not expect him to have such amazing chemistry with Owen Wilson. You would say that these two are so different - in life, acting choices, type of roles...and yet, according to Tom, Owen loves poetry, tennis, literature and is a great writer so they somehow clicked also behind the scenes.

The universe wasn't just expanding in the sense of adding color; it was evolving, breaking free from its rigid 1950s constraints. The fact that the bus now connects to the outside world instead of going in circles symbolizes this shift — a full transition from controlled, artificial perfection to real, messy, dynamic life.

mnym2kt,1k2xvz6,reddit,"Pleasantville took the rose-colored glasses off the view that life in the 50s was exactly like 'Leave It To Beaver' and the TV version of 'Father Knows Best'; took them off, dropped them on an anvil and smashed them with a sledgehammer.  And it was, in many respects, far gentler and a good bit subtler than it could have been.   It also got the message across about the risks of idealizing and romanticizing certain cultural and societal aspects based solely on heavily-biased viewpoints and extremely limited perspectives.

I saw it in the theater with my parents - who both grew up in the 50s - and they added a lot of context to some of the things that I didn't understand at the time.

My head canon is that it was a parallel universe that hadn't yet had many of the early catalysts that ultimately led to the massive changes in societal norms that happened in real life starting in the late 1950s and throughout 1960s with the growth of feminism, the sexual awakening, and the civil rights movement.  I think that David and eventually Jennifer (Bud and Mary Sue) served as some of those catalysts in the Pleasantville universe and that it would have helped that universe continue to transition from gray to color; and that because of their actions, it merged that timeline with our own universe's, becoming one and the same - making the Pleasantville world part of ours.  This is not easy to reconcile with the ending, of course, but it's my head canon, so who cares?",2025-04-19 17:51:26,1,paralyse78,movies
mnxvypf,1k2xvz6,reddit,"There is a previous reddit thread in which this was discussed.  Here is my take:


The end is the worst. Reese W'spoon is staying in the TV? For how long? Fu**in college? So, she will be gone for 4 years TV time at least, which should at least equal a day in real time... Meanwhile their mom is back at home (crying like we care, even though she has had 1 line to this point). She will probably have to ask where he daughter is at some point.


Bud gets back to real life with the remote. But when they first arrived, they had the remote, yet seemed to need Don Knotts' help on the TV screen. They begged him not to walk off screen. Cut to 2 weeks later, Toby McGuire ignores him and turns the TV off... then just uses the remote like he had it planned all along. Also, the remote disappeared with him. How is Reese ever getting home? Oh well.


Plus, wasn't this a TV show? What happens to the re-runs? Did the kids ruin the show? Or are we in an alternate timeline now? A timeline that is now a complete world with college in another town. So those college books are all filled in already? The prossors know what sex is at least? Or is Reese going to have to teach everyone there too?",2025-04-19 15:34:40,-6,sabo-metrics,movies

mmhwzxc,1jwevax,reddit,"I'm one of the types that can generally enjoy most films, but I just found this boring. Now I must preface this with I had zero interest in the movie, the trailers were what I hate about trailers, it essentially gives a beat for beat 2.5 minute edit of the film. But due to it getting great reviews I decided to watch it, because why not, I have A-List and 1 more film this week.

The entire movie seems built around the reveal and once you know it, you won't care about the movie again. And as the movie went on, I started remember the trailers, knowing what comes next and so on. The directing was also incredibly annoying, especially in the first half, when there's shit flashing up on the screen over and over. It felt way overproduced for a film that felt like a Lifetime/Hallmark/Netflix husband and wife Friday night movie.

Then there's the god damn skyline which looked so fake. Every time they pointed out the skyline, nothing looked real. It looked like a cardboard cut out pasted as a back drop. Like a stage play or something.

There's also some inconsistencies with the plot too that felt far fetched. The ending and reveal just weren't satisfying either. The one thing I'll give the movie is the cast wasn't flat out annoying. Even the intentionally obnoxious waiter was humorous enough. The two leads were fine too, even if they sometimes felt like they were forcing compassion.

Overall I thought this was one of the weaker films I've seen this year. Maybe if I hadn't seen the trailer I would have enjoyed it more, but alas I was potentially spoiled by marketing.",2025-04-11 02:15:36,37,braumbles,movies

mmhw2ud,1jwevax,reddit,"Drop is short but great movie!

- Meghann Fahy with a great performance. Been a fan of her since The White Lotus and this might be her break-out in movies. She's in almost every frame of the movie and her every facial expression was pitch-perfect. 
- Tonally, this is more of a thriller than a Christopher Landon's usual thriller-comedy. He's more restraint in the comedy in this movie due to the premise. I think he would have been a great fit for Scream 7.
- The movie is well-paced and it didn't overstay it's runtime. I think the text messages on stylized the screen (especially ""your son dies"") showing what's happening at the house via the home's CCTV instead of cutting to the house helps with the pacing and building tension. 
- The cinematography is a standout. Some of the overhead shots were really good
- The reveal of the villain is slightly unexpected for me as my main suspect was the bartender and the poison twist  was well revealed 
- The climax at the hotel and at the house was short but had 2 great callbacks with the hockey puck and the remote control truck. The son delivering the gun via remote control truck is honestly one of the funniest callbacks I have seen because it's so camp but it works.

mmohiaj,1jwevax,reddit,"So not only was I bored during this movie, but the more I think about it the less any of it makes sense.  

First, you’re going to arrange to kill a guy to cover up a financial crime?  Rarely happens. Just confess, you’ll get four years.  Murder by premeditation of this level is life without parole.

Second, you have a masked flunkie who is willing to go to some random woman’s house and just kill a child, and her sister, on demand.  Why not just have that guy do the killing of the real target?

Third, what if she said, no, just no, not going to poison this guy, and deleted the app.  Are you going to follow through with killing her son?  So not only are you going to murder the guy to stop him from snitching on your financial crime, which is way overkill in the first place, you’re going to randomly kill a child because some woman you randomly selected doesn’t do what you say?  So you’re now a child murderer and you haven’t even offed the snitch?  So much could go wrong with this plan; it’s like something Wile E. Coyote would come up with.  Foolproof it is not.  Just hire a hitman for God’s sake.

Fourth, how did she determine the secret messager was this blind date guy?  Maybe I missed it, but nothing in the plot gave it away.  She didn’t do some super genius sleuthing to figure it out.  She just used a little process of elimination (very little, she gave up suspecting the other guy as soon as his sister showed up for dinner, but how did she know it wasn’t the waiter or the bartender?) then took a wild guess and happened to be right.  So the lack of cleverness there was disappointing.

Fifth, he is supposedly “playing chess” and thinks of every possible angle but he is foiled when she just fakes pouring the poison into the shot?  Nothing more elaborate than that?  He didn’t even think of that?  More disappointing.

There’s more, but the movie is not worth any more of my time thinking about it.  I left the movie thinking it was pretty good, just not great, but the more I think about it the more I start to actively dislike it.  As well as all the reviewers who convinced me to see it.",2025-04-12 03:49:13,11,Automatic_Hyena_1436,movies

mmui6ei,1jwevax,reddit,"The movie was entertaining enough to pass the time. 
However few things didn’t seem to work. 
- Why did she tell him the pana cotta was poisoned so soon?? It would make so much sense had she waited a bit longer 
- The stupidest thing for me, was the fact that she drove all the way from the restaurant to her house to save her kid, as if that was the best option available. Calling the cops would have been a lot faster than her driving there I’d imagine. 
- The “drop” from the window was greatly dramatized and probably unnecessary, but well, they needed a moment to name the film I suppose 
- The most amusing part was how long the guy stuck around despite the date being so awful",2025-04-13 04:29:17,7,SpeedReader20,movies
mmhuo8d,1jwevax,reddit,"There's some things Drop is doing that makes it stand out and maybe a little more interesting, but overall I feel this is a movie I've seen before. A paranoid tech thriller, I was reminded a lot of Phone Booth or the famous Scream franchise openings. It's funny that Apple still refuses to let their tech be used by bad guys, so they had to invent DigiDrops and state out loud how it's different from Airdrops. 

This is a single setting movie. Technically there are two settings, the restaurant and her home, but 85% of the movie takes place in the restaurant without ever leaving it. And this movie is up to the challenge, you can feel the director getting fancy with the camera trying to make this space more interesting or just keep our eyes from getting bored. I think it only takes us so far, but the flair is there. It definitely feels like a single setting movie, though, and that makes it all feel very staged.

Megan Fahy is really good in this, which is great because so much of the movie revolves around her reading her phone with different shocked expressions. I was pretty unimpressed with the movie overall, but her performance really connects the themes. This isn't just about being harassed anonymously, it's about first date jitters. Women feeling unsafe on dates, acting strange because everything seems to pose danger to them, and looking crazy for it. On that level, I think this movie is really doing something and her performance is what makes it. She's constantly struggling to walk the line of being normal and dealing with all the terrible thoughts and dangers going on internally. 

The rest of the performances, sadly, not nearly as interesting. Sklenar has to be one of the least interesting personas I've seen on the big screen in a while. In both this and It Ends With Us he's just doing this perfect, vulnerable, caring guy and it's just not very interesting. Especially considering in this he's supposed to be a source of tension around whether or not he's the baddie, but the way he plays it I just don't believe that's possible for a second. Not to mention the movie makes him the target pretty quickly. So he's just this boring guy who is asked to fall in love with someone who can't stop looking at their phone and acting erratically. The rest of the side characters exist as red herrings and the one who ends up being the baddie gets to have five minutes of fun evil monologuing but it simply wasn't enough.

It's a 5/10 for me. Didn't hate it, didn't love it. It's a flashy whodunnit with an interesting theme of first dates from the perspective of someone who has been abused, but it's still a movie I feel like I've seen and had really no surprises in store for me.

* ""You're going to be fine!"" >!Sorry, a gunshot wound to the stomach is not a simple thing and the idea you toss a napkin at him to ""put pressure on it"" is silly!<

Well, that depends. It's basically like this:

1. 35mm: runs down.
2. VistaVision: same as \[1\] but runs side-to-side
3. 65mm: runs down
4. IMAX: same as \[3\] but runs side-to-side

It has a similar effect to watching a widescreen video on your phone: when you switch to landscape mode, the picture area suddenly gets a lot bigger. The bigger the picture area, the (1) smaller the grains are relative to the overall size of the image and (2) the less magnification the image requires for a screen of any given size.",2025-04-11 05:55:03,20,Chen_Geller,movies

I love Mike Myers but not all of his movies hold up. I watched Austin Powers the other day and its more a movie that was of its time.. even later Bond isn't as camp so people who know Bond since Daniel Craig wouldn't connect the jokes.

Malek is playing nerdy Jason Bourne essentially and shoutout to Holt McCallany for playing scum/ shady person in every single thing I’ve seen him in. Too many actors are wasted here.

mmi1yir,1jwev63,reddit,"I enjoyed this movie even though it was even more absurd than the trailer let on and seems to have been severely changed in post-production. Jon Bernthal is uncredited on main, but gets third billing in the end credits … and he’s in the movie for 3-4 minutes, and is a pointless character. Something happened there. I also don’t buy the last scene with Laurence Fishburne’s character; it seems like at least one scene with him is missing. 

But this is easily the most I’ve liked Rami Malek in a movie, and I found a few scenes to be surprisingly emotional. I find Rachel Brosnahan to be very endearing in a rather thankless part, which makes me excited to see what she does as Lois Lane.",2025-04-11 02:47:38,91,Busy-Effect2026,movies

mmhumh2,1jwev63,reddit,"I really wish this movie was better. As someone who is so tired of the ""messed with the wrong guy"" movies, this seemed like it had potential to be a little different. And it is a *little* different, and for that I was thankful. But it fails to really elevate and overall makes some strange choices. 

Rami Malek, despite being the main character and the producer, is far from the most interesting part of this movie, and that's kind of a shame. He's a classic under estimated character, but his tick is that he can't pull a trigger. Yet he has no problem pushing a button on his phone to blow someone up or drop them off a building. The movie does engage with this idea a little, a couple characters monologue about the cognitive dissonance involved to go one but not the other, but the movie doesn't dig into it enough. 

The supporting cast is really what lends this movie legitimacy. Laurence Fishburne, Holt McCallany, and a surprise third acgt Michael Stuhlberg really up the value here. All very in-the-pocket, not doing anything surprising but doing what's asked of them well. Jon Bernthal shows up for a role that is seemingly useless sequel bait, and it's just an odd choice because this movie already feels so much like The Accountant which comes out in two weeks. Rachel Brosnahan is also in this running the gamut of dead wife flashbacks, totally under utilized. 

Speaking of which, was anyone else certain that she would end up not being dead? It really feels like this movie sets that up really hard. You only ever see her death on CCTV cameras and there's a lot of ""no point in asking questions, we (the clandestine organization that trades in lies and secrets) are saying she's dead so she's dead"" when it happens. Not to mention there's a whole plot in this movie where Malek figures out how to manipulate live CCTV footage to put his face on people all over the globe and throw off the CIA. I was excitedly waiting for the conspiracy reveal that she's alive or even in on it, and for him to have already figured that out and planned for it. But no, none of that. It honestly feels like something was cut because the ending is just him tricking the big bad into getting arrested. 

Overall, I could see what this was going for, and maybe with a better script that is more surprising in the ways Malek uses his ""abilities"" this could have been a low key banger. But as it is he's just a natural wiz at making on-the-fly pipe bombs and a pretty solid problem solver. They could have leaned more into people starting to fear him, into the difference between pushing a button and pulling the trigger, and bigger into the conspiracy aspects. But sadly it all felt way underbaked. 6/10 for me, a positive score because if we have to get 10 movies like this a year this is the tone and attempt I prefer, but if they do run with a sequel it has a lot to improve upon.

mmsoe81,1jwev63,reddit,"Ok, this was an awesome movie. I didn't check any reviews before going in, but I scrolled through some of the comments here and was surprised at the lukewarm reception.

When people say ""they don't make em like that anymore,"" this is exactly the kind of movie we're talking about (or at least I am)! A fun 90's political action thriller. Patriot Games. Enemy of the State. Even verging into early 2000's Bourne Identity territory. Sure, it's not exactly revolutionary stuff. Government agent goes off the reservation for revenge and blows a conspiracy wide open along the way. But who cares? It was entertaining as hell.

I had a few minor gripes. Some pacing issues here and there, a few plot holes, reliance on genre tropes, but I don't think any of these were beyond forgiveness. I'm not even a big Rami Malek fan, but he was well-suited to the role. Holt McCallany is an under appreciated character actor. Surprised he hasn't gotten offered more lead roles. Jon Bernthal was certainly a surprise. I have to wonder what his salary was for his three scenes, plus he wasn't used in any marketing materials from what I saw. Stuhlbarg was also a bit random, but I'm not complaining.

I'll look forward to a sequel should this do well.

He knew the identities of the mercs and where they were - he could have gone after them and then leaked the information on the deputy director.

mmnqika,1jwev63,reddit,"It's fine, fairly middle of the road in terms of quality and a good time for date night. Funnily enough my girlfriend was more interested in why this dude was in bed with another woman while getting revenge for his wife.

In my opinion the problem is that they tried to keep too much from the book without having the time to develop any of it. Jon Bernthal and Laurence Fishburnes characters could've been rolled into one in my opinion, it felt weird that suddenly Jon shows up in Russia and starts offering Charlie a way out. Would've felt more natural if it was Fishburne trying to end the cat and mouse without spilling blood since it would let us see that he doesn't really agree with command on this one and avoid the whiplash his final scene gives you. They kinda do the same thing with Inquiline (or whatever her name was) where she shows up to help and then gets taken off the board without us ever getting to know her outside of exposition. I got that they were trying to show someone who also lost their partner but it fell flat since 1. We don't know her husband and 2. Her character is super boring. 

The kills were by far the best part, I think pretty much everyone is going to really enjoy the set pieces here since they are absolutely spectacular and fun to watch unfold. The issue is that they seemed to cut scenes of the best parts (watching Charlie's plans unfold) specifically in the hotel where it goes from him being surrounded by CIA to him suddenly on the rooftop in favour of showing us characters that are pretty boring to watch. And that's the movies main problem, endless bloat. You have Charlie's revenge, the bad CIA guys and the ""good"" CIA guys all fighting for screen time when they should've just leaned into Charlie globe trotting and taking out the killers.

I think Malek is good in it but I wish he'd just link up with Esmail again, neither of them have made anything that meets Mr.Robot in terms of quality since and this felt like a big step down for him in terms of shlock. I started giggling when he flew away in a plane wearing aviators at the end, it almost felt like the movie was winking at you and saying ""ya, we kinda realize this was a bit silly in retrospect. But we knew! Look how corny this is!"" But that only works if your movie is very obviously aware that it's corny throughout.

Also that final confrontation with the villain was dumb. I would've much rathered Charlie go out with the main villain and/or just admit that this was about revenge. Charlie should have called the villains philosophical horseshit and have said ""I just want to see you get what you deserve"" rather than having him arrested which doesn't really work for me when you consider that he's just horrifically killed three people. Kinda reminded me of the The Last of Us 2s ending a little.

On the other hand my girlfriend genuinely enjoyed it throughout. She's not into movies like me and said it was fun, even going so far as to start reading the book. Might be one of those movies that plays better for people that aren't spotting the shlock and clichés constantly.

Jon Bernthal was no where in the movie. One scene in the beginning and one at the end both of which could have been cut from the movie without it affecting the storyline. Such an injustice to a great actor. 

Rami was great for the nerdy side of the character but terrible for the emotional side, I didn't sense the loss and depression from losing his wife there.

For someone who arguably designed most if not all of the encryption software and surveillance he had no important role in the agency and seemed like a regular joe. 

For a 2 hr movie, I expected more planning and more detailed revenge scenes kinda like the hitman games but he was essentially just oh there you are and a second later you are not. 

The movie was also shot in Spain, France, England, Russia, Italy, turkey yet non of them stood out.

The Russian lady was one of the strongest parts of the movie, she played her character very well. 

Overall it is a forgettable movie. It needed the emotions from ""American Assassin"" combined with the thriller aspects of ""Bourne identity"" and the planning and execution of ""hitman"" games

mmodsun,1jwev63,reddit,"Just finished watching The Amateur — 10/10 👏🏼👏🏼Phenomenal. The only other film I’ve seen Rami Malek in was Bohemian Rhapsody, and the only performance I vividly remember from Laurence Fishburne was in Akeelah and the Bee (iykyk — yes, that phrase is part of my vocab now).

I found the production to be incredibly tight and methodical. Every element felt intentional, from the pacing to the tone. Malek was perfectly cast as the titular “amateur” — a soft-spoken, seemingly unremarkable coder whom everyone underestimates. His contrast with Jon Bernthal’s character, the charismatic and confident field agent, sets up a really interesting dynamic. One subtle but powerful moment is when Bernthal asks Malek’s character, “What are you doing after lunch?” You see this brief glimmer of hope — almost like he thinks he might finally connect with someone — only for that moment to be undercut when it’s clear he’s just being used for his skills. That quick emotional shift really stuck with me.

While some criticized the lack of deeper emotional scenes around his wife’s death, I thought the minimalism actually worked in the film’s favor. The grief was present, but not melodramatic — it simmered beneath the surface, fueling his transformation into someone capable of orchestrating such calculated revenge. The puzzle he discovers in her suitcase becomes a symbol he clings to — a tether to her memory and, in many ways, a source of inner strength. The moment he gets knocked out and the camera lingers on that puzzle piece felt deeply metaphorical — as if he’s finally letting go, acknowledging, “I can do this without you. I have the strength now.”

And that ending? Completely blew me away. The entire setup — how he turns the tables from his hotel room, outsmarting the system and controlling the ship remotely — was incredibly satisfying. There were several genuine wow moments for me, just watching how cleverly everything was orchestrated.

All in all, The Amateur was a masterclass in understated intensity and slow-burning revenge. Malek’s performance was layered and grounded, and the film’s symbolism, pacing, and final act made it one of the most memorable thrillers I’ve seen in a while.",2025-04-12 03:22:09,6,Kataang851,movies

mmiq8y9,1jwev63,reddit,"I honestly expected worse. Also the dead wife husband goes in vengeance has to be one of the most common tropes in action ever. It’s insane how common it is. I made a post on another sub but if people have any suggestions of the opposite with a dead husband or boyfriend with a wife or girlfriend getting vengeance I would love some suggestions. 

I will give this movie credit for two things. One presenting killing as sort of a hard choice that shakes people up. It’s not a big deal or anything but I feel so many movies that have people who have never killed before kill like it’s of no consequence and that it’s not a hard thing to do.

The second thing I will give this movie credit for is having a platonic and affectionate male and female friendship even if it was brief. I think it could have been so easy to make them sleep together out of grief or have a kiss but I’m glad it didn’t go there. 

That aside I love a lot of this cast Juliette Nichols, holt, bernthal etc but felt none of them had room to really do anything that interesting. I sorta blame the script more than anything. The director might not win any awards any time soon but I thought his previous work was better especially his work on black mirror

I loved the tension in the scene where Rami doesn't know that one of the CIA agents is on his side, and Laurence doesn't realize he's also being hunted. I wish this dynamic carried further into the story.

It also baited me into thinking Inquiline was that fat coworker and not some lady from Istanbul, I was sure they were going for a double twist where he got a new message from Inquiline after she died, Oh well.

I also felt like the ending was mutilated by test audiences. I wanted him to immediately pull the trigger when given the gun by the end villain, and then immediately get shot and die by the two remaining guards.

Roger Ebert's reviews keyed me into movies that I ended up loving that I would have otherwise missed, like Dark City and Six-String Samurai.

That still seems to be an issue with critics today, but maybe ""elevated"" horror would have gotten some praise from them.

mm3hgda,1jug8gf,reddit,"We don't have anyone who can step into their shoes.  And probably won't until someone who's an actual critic, who approaches the subject as seriously and studiously as Siskel and Ebert did, materializes.

Most people think being ""a critic"" is super easy.  You just say something about something (films in this case).  Right?  Easy, right?

Any asshole can have an opinion.  But these days, every asshole has a camera and wants to be paid for being famous.  Film critic, any kind of art critic, used to be a serious thing for people who not only had credentials but a serious and dedicated approach to it.

On the credentials, it's not about having a degree makes you better.  It's a demonstration of intent if nothing else; that your intent is serious.  And also, to equip you with the tools to use that dedication to be serious in your pursuit.  Ebert's degree was in journalism, Siskel's in philosophy (and he *studied* writing).  Both were professional writers in the old-school meaning of it; in that they had to cite sources and use rounded, intelligent language rather than hyperbole and lots of exclamation points.

Another reason why people think being ""a critic"" is easy when they think about it in the abstract is they assume you just ""get to go do fun stuff you already like.""  Which is not what being an actual, true, dedicated, studious critic is.

Old school film critics saw many, many, many films each week.  Not just the good ones.  The bad ones.  The really bad ones.  The ones most of us never heard about.  The little ones, sometimes the ones from far away places that have little relevance to any average person in the global audience.

If you just get to go see big movies, sure it sounds fun to think of being a critic.  Look at the Youtuber ""critics"", and that's what you get.  They pick out big popular movies they pretty much wanted to see anyway, turn on their little webstudio setups, and ramble for a bit, then upload it for views and call it ""content.""

People reference Siskel and Ebert even today, a decade or more after their deaths, because those two guys were students of film.  Even in their final years, they still studied film.  They *studied* film.  Not just watched movies.  They explored, considered, learned about what goes into a film.  And could *articulate* that knowledge.

The average person, which is what many Youtuber/TikTok/Twitter and other critics are, will classify films into two categories.  ""Movies I like"" and ""Movies I hate.""  That's it.  That's as far as it goes.  Which is fine, but they then ramble to produce ""content"" for clicks that says *nothing* about the films.

They never have any whys.  They never know a reason, a why, they can explain when they ramble.  Nothing they can articulate.  It's just ""ooh, so cool"" or ""man, huge miss"" and that's as deep as it is.  Like a millimeter deep puddle on the sidewalk that you don't even notice your shoe stepping in, that's what's offered up as ""criticism.""

It's entirely, absolutely, utterly possible for a movie you hate to be, in fact, a good movie.  One that's well made with craft and expertise, with passion and soul, one that resonates even if not with you.  That, for all that, you just don't like despite those qualities.  Which is quite fine and totally okay.  But even if you hate it, that doesn't mean it isn't well made in one or more ways.  Perhaps it has exceptional writing, ground breaking cinematography, delicate and nuanced performances from actors who dug deep to emote and breathe life into the characters and their roles within the narrative.  And hundreds of other little things that can go into the huge complicated mass of decisions that result in ""a movie.""

""Content"" critics, those who are casual and just doing it for ""content"" they can get clicks (and thus money) from, *rarely* demonstrate even a fraction of the studied knowledge and awareness to have anything truly interesting to say about a film.  Regardless whether they like or dislike that particular film.

Siskel and Ebert had things to say about films.  Articulate things.   They had the education and background of investment into the field of visual storytelling we call filmmaking to know how to say what they thought about the films they watched.  They had references, comparisons.  They could articulate trends, even spot them from time to time.

When either would skewer a film, it *meant* something because it was a student of film saying it.  When a Youtuber rambles and rants trying to find a zinger they then smash-cut-edit into a ""review"", they're just trying to be cool or catchy.  And it comes from a meaningless place, because the only difference between the Youtubers and the guy on the next barstool over is the Youtuber said it into a camera.

And **everyone** has a camera these days.  Anyone can click and type on their computer, even their phone for a few minutes and not only open a channel but then upload to it.  When everyone has a camera and (seemingly) everyone is uploading their ""thoughts"", it's meaningless.  Which is what passes for ""criticism"" on Youtube and other social media.  An endless flood of meaningless thoughts without even the most minor of context, support, or study to frame it with.

Most Youtubers don't even write.  They don't sit down and *write*.  Like, for example, a script.  They simply point the camera at themselves and talk, talk, talk, ramble, ramble, then slap little clips together until they have something they then upload and monetize.

And call that being a critic.

I didn't often agree with either Siskel or Ebert's tastes in films.  But I (and apparently many, many others) respected their writings about film because they were students of film.  The main difference, IMO, between them and academic film scholars is Siskel and Ebert usually tried at least a little to be approachable in what they had to say about film.  I didn't have to agree with them to see they knew enough about film to have something relevant say.

Siskel and Ebert were two guys who studied film, who were studied critics, who a local PBS station decided to point a camera at.  Sincerity and effort spread their content.  Neither was handsome or charming by modern click culture standards; but their sincerity and invested effort in the subject of film resonated.  Resonates even today.

Youtube ""content creators"" don't resonate.  They just chase the algorithm because they want the paycheck.  The lack of sincerity, the lack of investment in the subject they're using as their surfboard, can be felt by enough of the audience to prevent any resonance from elevating them to anywhere near the same level of relevance Siskel and Ebert enjoyed.  That lack of resonance is why, while some of those ""content creator"" channels are making very good money, they don't have anywhere near the same kind of deep impact Siskel and Ebert continue to have today.",2025-04-08 20:27:55,1,AskMeWhatISaid,movies

There was a sequel made to the 70's Poseidon Adventure.  I would honestly love to see a RiffTrax version of it ""Beyond The Poseidon Adventure"" heck of a cast too including an extremely young Mark Harmon.  Telly Savalas just killed it though.

Then you have the very B -movie that was entirely too long  ""The Swarm"".

Dante's Peak and Volcano are still two of my favorites. 

You should check out the 70's flick ""Earthquake"" and then talk about a stacked cast  check out ""avalanche"".

not ""technically a disaster flick but it's close Ghost Storm and Into The Storm have some cool moments and effects.  Kinda a shame about Into the storm it had so much potential and they spent money on the effects but the documentary type formula just didn't fly.

mmrz9ws,1jxmbho,reddit,"*Lawrence of Arabia* has a special place in my heart. It came out 40 years after the events that inspired it, so people who had actually been there lived long enough to see the movie. One of them said something to the effect of ""there was sand and there were camels, those parts are true.""

Modern-day Jordan, where it was filmed (and is largely set) is really proud of the movie, but not at all proud of the history behind it. Case in point, my tour guide in Wadi Rum was all excited to show us specific filming sites, but when we got to the remnants of the Hejaz Railway it was ""ugh, this is where those British guys blew stuff up and never fixed it."" The current king is also the product of his father's marriage to a British woman he met when she was working on the movie, so there's that too. But they don't actually remember T.E. Lawrence as a hero or the founder of their nation. 

In all fairness to the filmmakers, T.E. Lawrence was *extremely* circumspect in his memoir, *The Seven Pillars of Wisdom*, in part because he was leaving out the man he'd been in love with (and that guy was historically quite important in his decision-making, so without him, the stories have some holes.) Plus, of course, everyone is the hero of their own story, and the contemporary press also went out of its way to make Lawrence seem more heroic than he was. So when you set out to adapt some of these sources into a movie, you're gonna end up making him seem like a much better soldier than he was (or at least, a much better man.) And they couldn't mention the homosexuality or the part where Lawrence eventually got drummed out of the military for paying a subordinate officer to be his dom. Again, without that part, the story is a bit different!

So, is it a good movie? Sure. Does it bear any resemblance to history? Nope!",2025-04-12 18:54:45,31,thefuzzybunny1,movies

The remaining members of The Doors said Jim Morrison didn't behave as extreme as that and some events, like locking Pam in the closet and setting it on fire, never happened, but Val Kilmer became Jim Morrison, the mythic Morrison of Rock'n'Roll fantasy, and nailed it. If you think of it as a rock fable it is a great piece of movie spectacle. 

Amadeus has a tiny kernel of truth to it: rumors did get started towards the end of Salieri's life that he murdered Mozart, but it's believed to have been a wild overstatement of something Mozart's bitter old father said about Mozart's lack of business sense; he was notoriously hard to work with and didn't get as many contracts as other composers and Mozart's father blamed it on a conspiracy by the Italians in Vienna, the most influential being Salieri, to keep him out of the limelight. A play was created ""what if""ing on the idea that Salieri did it, and it was made into the movie, but in actuality Salieri was driven to great grief by these accusations and spent his final years in an asylum, possibly succumbing to dementia  because of the strain of it all. But it is one of the most beautiful and opulent piece of film history about a long bygone era, even if the clothes and furnishings and technology are all mixed up and inaccurate for the specific years Mozart lived - I will always love it.",2025-04-12 18:57:02,6,VerilyShelly,movies

Made now given the success of hard R rated films it would be much better. I really liked Thomas Jane but he wasn't ""Punishery"" enough. Not his fault. 
The tiny budget, corporate (appeal to all demographics ) mindset and filming locations didn't help.

Frank is relentless in his goals, brutal, merciless and violent.
Wouldn't use an icecream to torture someone.

They took a few of Garth Ennis' story beats and did what they could, The Russian etc..
The short ""Dirty Laundry"" was great ( genuinely loved Tom Jane) .. shame he was wasted.

Supporting cast ranges from good to great; the not-so-love interest is kinda forced and wooden, but you know how a studio loves shoehorning romance in. Ben Foster makes anything he's in 1000x better, and the interrogation scene is one of the best in the whole movie.

mk5yfhq,1jls2r2,reddit,"As a punisher fan, I like some of the western motifs, like the dual with the gutarist and the stand off with some other gangsters but Thomas Jane never felt like Frank to me. Also a miriad of issue with how he enacts violence on people also doesn't feel close to the character, for example the torture scene where he uses a frozen lolly on someone was just awful. I'm not looking for ghoulsih ultra violence for the sake of it, but that's just not how the punisher operates. We're talking about a guy who shoots a womans face off on the chance she might be criminal like her son, hell he even shoots Micro in the face for slightly betraying him. He'd have no holdups about fucking this guy up. I think this movie and season one of the show kind of shoot themselves in the foot by having him pursue his families killers. Read Up is Down, Black is White, pretty much reveals the punisher does this because he loves the violence, his families deaths are kind of the excuse he needs and orgnaised crime is a perfect target.

The opening of the film does what normal revenge thrillers would do with it's setup but making Frank an FBI agent even though this is kind of antithetical to how he thinks and misunderstands how the chraracter views police, the justice system, etc. Kind of missed the point of the character IMO.

Was it tough to incorporate the amount of CGI used in this movie within that budget (if it's accurate)? I hope we see more smaller budgeted movies that can use CGI as effectively as this movie did to help convey the story, and stay relatively on the lower cost end.

Also Will Poulter was hilarious.  There must be some fun outtakes from set.

mlds3t1,1jrbhl6,reddit,"Hi! I absolutely loved the movie and immediately bought A24s Unicorn Horn Lamp (totally not a dildo) as soon as i saw it. One question! 

What was the process of casting Paul Rudd in an unlikeable character role? The audience is so accustomed to liking him in a role that seeing him play an unlikeable character is jarring. (hes not BAD like the rich family is, but he makes almost every wrong decision there is to being a good father until the bedroom scene)  i do love the redemption he had at the end, but GOD did i hate that i hated him for 90% of the movie. What was the deciding factor that led to him being in the role vs someone the audience isnt used to liking?

Also sorry second question, at the end of the film, do Paul/Jennas characters live?? I took it as the Unicorns bailing them out of certain jail, but others took it as them being sent to the afterlife to be with the mom. Whats your call?

mlco1kv,1jlmupl,reddit,"So, I rewatched it just to make sure I didn't miss anything. While the first half is full of clues, the second half doesn't make much sense. I came up with a theory to understand what is happening here but it doesn't fit perfectly. Here you go:
1) the photographs: in the beginning we see how girls and women are photographed. We see how the camera flash illuminates the faces and if you stop, you can see horrifying faces. Their eyes are kinda eerie. 
--> this sets the atmosphere of the film: underneath the good looking and smiling faces is some kind of horror. 
Later, she photographs Harry and we briefly see him very different wearing one earring. I'm not sure but it seemed to me that it was two different persons. I'm general, photographs play an important role in the movie and hint that there is more going on under the surface. 

2) The pearl earrings: Nancy looks frantically through all her stuff - also through few jewelry boxes! - before she accuses the babysitter of any wrong doing. The babysitter has black hair and doesn't fit with the general aesthetic of Holland we saw in the beginning. The babysitter has to go which could be a metaphor for anyone who doesn't fit has to leave Holland. She finds the earring in a box full of buttons. It appears that the earring has been intentionally misplaced. It could be a hint that Fred is gaslighting her - hiding things and accusing her of being crazy. 

3) Nancy watches Mrs Doubtfire (I don't know what to make of it). She searches the house again to look for the pearl earring and finds the Polaroids. It seems like she is drawn to that hidden box in the garage. That could imply that she already has found the Polaroids before. She also knows what kind of lock the restroom in Fred's office is and texts the info to Dave. She also mysteriously knows the combination for the safe at his office. In general, her plan to break in seems to be well planned and could be that she has done it before. 

4) Dave: Nancy actively flirts with Dave from the beginning. They are both drawn to each other, because they are the odd ones in Holland. I think Dave is real until he breaks up with her after making out with her. Afterwards, we don't see him interacting with anyone - except one time with Fred in the bar and later in the house. So, Dave is both - real and not real at the same time. I think after the break up and the racist incident, Dave is not real but an imagination of Nancy that takes over. Nancy goes home and finds out that Fred is a serial killer, she goes back to watch Fred entering that house with the dogs. She fights with him a little but that's it. She doesn't kill him, she just leaves. Why do I think so? Because we see in the movie that Dave fights Fred but that could be a wishful thinking of Nancy who longs for a hero to safe her. Later, we see that Dave goes to Nancy in tha Garage and tells her & lies to her that he confronted Fred and that Fred is gone --> I think this ""lie"" about the confrontation is the truth how things went down and the fighting scene is only in her head. Also another reason why Dave is not real: She doesn't need him to break in into the hotel room of Fred and Dave doesn't add anything to the plot of the movie. Nancy imagines Dave trying to stall Fred at the bar which is strange, because why doesn't Fred recognize Dave? She imagines Dave suffering from killing Fred but we see her how stressed she is in the social settings. We also see Dave being injured on the head but Nancy is the one who has a blood stain on her forehead until the end. She imagines Dave getting a gun but that is herself getting a gun from the backyard. 

5) Harry: I don't know. In her first dream, Harry seems to be a doll and this could be her worrying that Harry becomes his father's puppet. Also the second dream, Harry screams and says repeatedly: Wake up, Mom! So, Harry knows something is off with his father and that's why Nancy and Harry can cooperate in the last scene. Harry looks terrified when he is with his father behind the motel at the lake. He also immediately knows to trust his mother over Fred and runs away. He also tries to save his mum. 

So, that are my few cents.",2025-04-04 10:28:48,8,Sea_Economy_7760,movies

There are moments where it was genuinely engaging mostly when it focused on Macfayden’s off putting performance and Kidman did shine at times as well. The problem for me was that none of the movie seemed to go together and scenes just happened one after the other without building any momentum. The big reveal, if you can call it that, was fun I guess but it didn’t fit the tone of the rest of the film up till that point.

It reminded me of TWIN PEAKS and then I was ready to put it into a category of great bad movies (GREY GARDENS, THE ROOM, SHOWGIRLS, ROCKY HORROR, etc.) And then something clicked. I began to wonder ‘are Nancy and Dave — the same person. Wait. Maybe Dave and Fred are the same person? No. Hold everything. Are Nancy, Dave and Fred the same person? Is Nancy the real serial killer and both Fred and Dave are parts of her personality? Did Nancy have a psychotic break? Does she suffer from multiple personalities? Did Nancy’s brain create Fred to act out her evil thoughts? And later, her brain creates Dave to destroy that evil part of her? Ultimately, Dave was gone; where did he go? And why are Dave and Nancy narrating the story at the end? I’m rambling because I just finished watching the movie and I’m going to have to watch it again.

ml8wmzt,1jlmupl,reddit,"Saw this last night with family. WT actual F?

For starters it's just all over the place in tone. You've got this Stepford Wives thing going on. She's trying to do this 1950s housewife life. This performance, yeesh. The husband is like halfway there with it too. It's set in 2000 for no reason at all. They don't do anything with that. You've got this weird dream sequence Stephen King thing. They're trying to get very artsy with some shots out of nowhere once in a while. About half an hour in I turned to someone and asked Is she losing her mind? Is that what this is?

It falls flat on it's face at every genre it's trying, or not trying to do. I can't tell. OMG I actually cannot tell what this movie was trying to be. Is it comedy? Dark comedy? Satire? Mystery? Thriller? It seems like it's trying and failing to be all of those at different points and will then turn on a dime to the next one. It was labeled as ""psychological thriller"". No. Omg no lol.

And then let's go to the plot holes. Idk what the hell they're trying to do or trying to say by the end. Are they trying to say teacher friend Deputy Dewey (I don't know these actors) wasn't real? Because no. He very clearly interacts with people when Kidman isn't around. And real people have reactions to him. What was his past and his buried gun luggage thing? How did the husband just show up after being stabbed and drowning? And he was stabbed and drowned. That scene at the end was like they forgot he was suppose to have been stabbed and added ADR coughing from him when he's in the car but not seen on camera. Oh lord was that bad and distracting. Was the husband even real? Well yeah. Were the murders real? There's news clippings in the library so yeah. Was the entire thing just in her head as a bored housewife or insane person? Idk. Idk to any of that.

Matthew MacFayden is very good in this movie, and Gael Bernal Garcia does an okay job (not much to work with honestly). 

Was this movie trying to be something more than a movie about a suspicious wife who discovers her husband is a serial killer? 

All of the supernatural, absurd flashes and visions she was having just led to nothing? Why did they even lean in the whole Holland, MI element? 

At the end, both the kid and the dad are coughing randomly, which seems to suggest something but I don’t quite know what.

Also, was there something with the kid that I just didn’t pick up? The headphones, his demeanor, him seemingly not in the conjoining room but down some stairs despite them being in a bungalow, his facial expressions in the car at the end, etc. What was the point?

mkle3r9,1jlmupl,reddit,"I’m not sure if *Holland* is a movie men can’t relate to, but I found it incredibly powerful — and honestly, horrifying in a very subtle way. It captures the dread of being trapped in a life where everyone looks the other way.

The husband is passively abusive, always carrying this underlying threat — like he could have Nancy committed to an asylum at any time. There’s even this unspoken fear that he might be drugging her, like when she misplaces her pearl earrings (which, she’s wearing in the final shot).

The whole town adds to this atmosphere of denial and suppression. Like the student of Dave’s who has a black eye — it’s obvious something is wrong at home, but no one says anything. Nancy is clearly desperate to escape, yet she’s still trying to be a good mother, a good woman, afraid of being judged or rejected by the people around her. That fear, for me, symbolizes the core of everyday misogyny — how women are often expected to silently endure.

Her husband isn’t cheating — he’s killing women. And yet Nancy is still caught in this emotional paralysis, as if she still can’t leave. It’s as if the film is pointing out that, in a twisted societal hierarchy, cheating with another woman is perceived as a greater betrayal than murdering one. That says something deeply disturbing about how women’s worth is framed — especially through the eyes of other women.

Dave at first seems like a possible escape for Nancy, someone who sees her — but that illusion falls apart, too. There’s a moment when a man calls him out as possibly being gay, suggesting that he’s also trying to fit into a mold that doesn't reflect who he really is. Their connection seems to be based more on the shared desire to escape than actual romantic chemistry.

And Dave, despite seeming like the “nice guy,” also displays troubling behavior. He pressures Nancy into blackmailing her husband, lies and tells her he is gone — and then disappears completely when she returns after actually killing him. There’s a subtle pattern of control and abandonment there, just in a different flavor than what we see with her husband.

The film is full of these quiet hypocrisies and unsettling ironies. Like when Nancy’s son says something like, “Dancing is for the devil,” only to sit in the back seat listening to an explicit '00s song. Or when Nancy tells her friends that her husband is away on a business trip, and they casually mention they saw him in town — without any concern or confusion that she doesn’t know his whereabouts.

I think this is a brilliant movie — not loud or overly dramatic, but layered with subtle social critiques, especially about women’s roles and the masks we’re expected to wear. Nicole Kidman’s performance as Nancy is absolutely incredible.

For me, this is already one of the best films of 2025.",2025-03-30 22:34:57,10,Alternative-Main-118,movies

ml1dswu,1jlmupl,reddit,"I came here to talk about this movie because I at first wasn't sure what it was even about. Then I saw it discussed on my community FB page; I happen to live in Yale where the Bologna Queen was from so it peeked my interest more after wards.

  
I see a lot of unhappy people with this film but I actually enjoyed the film for it's surface value. I think if you are a Michigan native and especially someone from a small town you are going to maybe get some of it's intricacies a little easier. I was born not in Yale but a town a few towns over which was also small; there's actually a lot of those around here. 

There is a lot to unpackage in this film but something I could feel immediately is that in a small town things always seem utterly perfect on the surface. Nobody really knows what is going on behind closed doors and peoples private lives. Which you know you really shouldn't? But, I found having lived in these towns that when something so wild happens it hits the town dramatically and shakes the very foundations of 'comfort' you superficially have. Which is what I felt so strong being conveyed in this film. They had this little perfect life going on; everything was so wonderful and her life seemed great. But, like many things something just didn't sit right and went into that uncanny valley zone. Which, honestly? Her husband gave me that vibe early on in the film. He seemed to just rub me the wrong way. 

I think one of the bigger points I found interesting was in the small details. When she came across the zip codes on the back of the blue prints; if you look those up they are all real places. My mom and I tried to figure out how he managed to meet these woman and to see if there was common denominator. We came down to festivals which  in the film the newspaper about the Bologna Queen murder the newspaper was from July -- which is when the festival really is held. The only one that didn't seem to add up was the girl from Madison since she was an Activist.

But, there is a lot of details to look into for this film and I suppose some people wouldn't want to do that which I entirely understand.

mn5c1tn,1jlmupl,reddit,"I liked the movie. I love Nicole kidman. A few scenes her Botox was super distracting but mostly I was fine with her. She is a bit miscast but she did well with what she had to work with.

As for the ending, I think it is meant to be ambiguous on purpose. I too wondered if GGB character was in Nicole Kidman's characters head, but no.

Hear me out.

gGB character interacts with other side characters. I think GGB was, like Kidman, escaping an old life long ago. For GGB, it was a life of crime or a life where he hurt someone badly. He has a hidden gun. Flavors of him swearing to never hurt again like a former hitman etc. He seems blase to violence, as if he had seen it often long ago. I think GGB and NK are parallel characters but NOT the same person. 

At the end they each react differently. He leaves town. She stays and wonders at how she escaped it all. She wants it to be a dream. She doesn't want to believe it happened.

But it happened. There are over 3 end scenes with the husband coughing and weak. He got stabbed. It is assumed he cleaned up the crime scene and got rid of the video camera GGB had.

That is my take on it. There is meant to be no clear answers, but I think the answer leans towards GGB leaving town because it wasn't the town he thought it was, a town of peace that he wanted. NK stayed at least for a bit. The overlap VO at the end is just to highlight how similar they were in nature, in wanting to escape to a simple life, but they both clearly react differently, I think because one committed violence long ago, the other a victim to violence or the fear of violence.

mnpwr1g,1jlmupl,reddit,"ALL SPOILERS:  
  
I think that Dave, from the beginning, is a part of Nancy's inner psyche. She met Fred as a troubled soul and he only made her much worse. Dave was Nancy's escape hatch.

Dave often appears in dark light in the movie while Nancy is illuminated. All the scenes with Dave (at Fred's office, at school, even Dave's own students and the student's father) have been made up by Nancy to create a heroic image of Dave. Dave and Nancy both have vivid dreams about water, because Nancy is the one dreaming.   
  
Nancy has imagined what it would be like if Dave could prove Fred is a killer and even fight him. She has a hard time imagining their conversation afterwards and the best she came up with is ""So you do know my wife"" and Dave saying ""I'm sorry."" Dave would never have said he was sorry, but Nancy would have.   
  
After Nancy is convinced that Fred is in fact a serial killer, she starts to disassociate, and we no longer see Dave at school at all. She now knows she and Harry are in major trouble and could also be killed and she no longer has the energy for an imaginary Dave.

At the parade, Dave and Nancy communicate only with their eyes. She fully battles with him internally when they meet up near Harry and she says ""Is that a gun?"" ""Take your hand off me or I'll scream"" - but no one hears her because it's an internal conversation. 

She knows Fred will be following her to the motel, so she debates whether or not Dave should be there to protect her. Another conversation is a debate over whether she should call the police (and ruin her life and Harry's) and ends with her physically getting injured from the TV. 

GREAT point [Sea\_Economy\_7760](https://www.reddit.com/user/Sea_Economy_7760/) that Dave's head was hurt - but Nancy's head had the blood on it even after she washed at the beach, and as the car scene progresses, the blood looks much more like a wound. 

Fred's language instantly turns to suppressed rage and that was very realistic for an abuser who knows he's been caught; but Fred shouldn't know that he's been caught. As far as he knows, Nancy and Harry have been going about their normal life. But if Nancy, on her own, had caught Fred, stabbed him, and left him, it would explain his intense hatred of her.   
  
Nancy's terror at that point is real. She'll do anything to keep herself and Harry alive. 

And Fred alludes to having a split personality one who murders, one who is ""stable."" He says the ""real you"" is with him ""and not in that motel room."" He's suggesting he knows Nancy also has a split personality. To be clear Fred's inner personality is demonic; Nancy's inner personality is defensive and protective. 

Harry, like all children of an abusive parent, is fully aware his father's behavior is scary and he can't wait to run.  
  
It was very therapeutic for Nancy to beat Fred to death with the shoe, symbolizing the town and religion that she thought could protect her. Even the blood on the driver's side window is in the shape of a cross.   
  
The ending: ""I was afraid to trust anyone. Even myself.""  
Said together because Nancy will continue to have Dave protect her as she and Harry attempt to go forward.",2025-04-18 06:39:19,1,No-Breadfruit-6850,movies

But I think it's because it's a nearly perfect movie - it reminds me why I love movies/cinema. It didn't try to be something it wasn't. When it's funny, it's *really* funny. When it's horror, it's excellent horror. Who knew the first comedy horror would be the best one forever?

I had a similar feeling at the end of Fright Night! It's also a near-perfect film that ends brilliantly.

But when it happens to someone they don’t like it all of a sudden goes out the window. Why do people act like Ayer releasing his version of Suicide Squad will personally hurt them? Just let him do what he wants and dont watch the movie

Im not saying it would be great, but I doubt it’s worse than what we got. From what we know, at least Ayer’s version had an actual edit and score by Steven Price, as opposed to the weird neon flashbacks set to pop songs

* Street Kings was ok

* End of Watch was awesome

* Sabotages sucked, and it came in that Arnold is back to movies time. I did like his other one Last Stand a lot with the guy that made the Good Bad and Ugly and I Saw the Devil.

* Fury was great

* Suicide Squad sucked, but I'd be down to watch his Ayer cut for sure.

* Bright...I enjoyed it, but overall it sucked and they didn't do more so meh

I have not seen the rest of his movies. I will say I'd enjoy some bad/fun Statham movie, but I feel it is not the same excitement I had for the guy after his first few movies.

This AMA has been verified by the mods. Jeremy and Michael will be back at 4 PM ET today to answer any questions.

Information from the filmmakers:

Hey Reddit,

We are Jeremy Workman (director) and Michael Townsend (film subject) from the new doc SECRET MALL APARTMENT. Part heist movie and part rallying cry against corporate overlords, the film tells the wild story of Michael and seven other artists creating an apartment inside the busy Providence Place Mall.

The film had a huge opening last weekend in Providence - at the mall itself! - and opens today in New York at the IFC Center. It expands to other cities Friday.

Here's our trailer: https://youtu.be/B9OCYOD-e9s?si=QlISDHyVyCx8ZW0V

1. How would you think your film relates to the more modern problems of housing and the idea of squatting in ways that weren't covered in the film?      
2. Do you have any updated views on those subjects that have changed since completing this experiment and making this film?

A few questions to choose from… 😁

—

Michael, what was the first night like sleeping inside the mall? Were you terrified of being caught… or did it feel like the ultimate childhood dream come true?

Jeremy, at what point did you know this wasn’t just a quirky doc, but something much bigger? Like, ‘this is actually a heist movie about freedom’ bigger?

Did the mall ever suspect anything before you were discovered, or did they legit have no clue for years?!

Michael, what’s something you didn’t include in the film that still makes you laugh or shake your head today?

**What’s your dream screening location for Secret Mall Apartment? A closed Sears? A working food court? A rooftop in defiance of corporate real estate?**

Michael, question for you: Are you feeling hopeful for the future of the mall? Do you think there's potential for bringing in the greater arts community into that larger space? I know anecdotally that RISD students don't necessarily frequent it that much and obviously there's nothing really artsy about the mall, except your exhibits going on now. Do you think it can be improved upon to finally serve the community in a more harmonious, dare I say ""Cool"" way?

mjvy6rf,1jke7x0,reddit,"Hello! Saw the movie at the Providence Place Mall and it was such a great experience! My question is: It seems, eventually, that the apartment became this sort of “third place” for the crew. Essentially a place to all get together and just hang and be together. Providence Place has just implemented a curfew barring teens under 18 from being at the mall during school hours and after 5pm without an adult. Considering malls are often the first real “third place” for teens, what do you think of rules like these and what could be a better option for kids looking to spend time with like-minded individuals?",2025-03-26 19:36:07,3,AnyankaDarling,movies

mjya0dw,1jke7x0,reddit,"Michael & Jeremy,
I saw Secret Mall Apt last night (Tues 3/25) at Providence Place. I first saw it last year at The Elms outdoor screening in Newport which was such a cool event (and the irony of the venue was not lost on me), but I was sitting so far back that I knew I needed to rewatch it at some point. So glad you are doing these national screenings!

I’m fairly younger than the Apt Crew, and from 2003-04ish I was a high school Jr/Sr working at the food court Ben & Jerry’s. This film is such a hit of nostalgia for us PVD millennials who were a bit too young for Ft Thunder but still loved Lightning Bolt and the art scene. I remember hearing about the project maybe shortly after I stopped working at the mall and was like, “Oh yeah, I could totally see that happening” just due to the service hallways and garage nooks & crannies I would see while taking the trash to the basement. (I also wonder if I ever made you guys a milkshake or smoothie! 😂)

I was reflecting on the film today and thought of questions I would ask if given the opportunity:

1. If Michael and the crew from 2003 existed in present day PVD, do you think you could still pull off the apt experiment? What would be more difficult to execute? What would be easier? Would it have more/less impact now? How do RI political climate/players, housing crisis, 20+ more years of gentrification, technological advancements/social media, and malls aging out affect the outcome? (Also, what would Smiley’s reaction be?! 😂)
2. How long would it take you to get from the apt to the nearest bathroom in an emergency? 😂

Thank you!

mk1gj1p,1jkfptq,reddit,"the trailer looked intriguing and the movie definitely delivered, i appreciated the fact that it was conceptual, but also plot-driven and definitely seemed to move to its own beat which is hard to find these days and generally 

i think the only thing that i would make some points about (which ill say is something that i only do if i ended up being a fan of the movie) is how the ending turned out to be unnecessarily long and overly explanatory where we ended up seeing each character's journey, i somewhat understand why they did this at least with aria's and mia's, whereas with the assessor it turned into the movie almost hitting us over the head in order to establish the plot points 

apart from that, solid film, appreciated how futuristic, dystopian it was, without being overtly topical and commenting on current politics, while still delving into real world topics unapologetically

mmkf3su,1jkfptq,reddit,"I find it super weird that you would expect this film to make any money or get any kind of mainstream audience. I liked it enough, but by mainstream standards it's very very strange.

It's a dystopic sci-fi in the form of a domestic drama (or the other way around) about a couple trying to pass an extremely unsettling assessment in order to be allowed a child by an authoritarian state in a post-apocalyptic society where people live forever by taking a special medication.

It includes a fair few pretty disturbing scenes, including a very uncomfortable rape scene.

Admittedly, it has some bankable stars involved, but nothing else about this suggests it would achieve any kind of mainstream success.

mogafqc,1k56rbg,reddit,"""the things you own end up owning you"" is a pretty big baseline theme in the Jack Reacher character.  It doesn't move the plot, but it's essentially his whole head-scratching lifestyle that at first always seems insane, borderline hobo, but after he explains it, makes total sense.  There's one book where his old commanding officer leaves him a fully paid-off house in his will, but he turns it down.  He explains pretty succinctly that home ownership means taxes and utilities and upkeep.  And that taxes and utilities and upkeep means he'll need a steady job. And that a steady job means owning a car and a closet full of decent clothes. And that owning a car means insurance and paying for gas.  And so on.  He doesn't even own a change of clothes, bc that means owning a suitcase and paying for laundry and a place to keep the suitcase.  Instead he wears clothes for a few days, washes them in a sink to dry overnight, and every few days walks into a Goodwill and buys replacements, dropping the old ones in the trash on the way out.

Andrew also directed two other critically-acclaimed films, **Driveways** (2019) and **Fire Island** (2022)

Information from the filmmakers:

-------------------------------------------------------------------

We will be back tomorrow Wednesday 4/17 at 3:00 PM ET to answer your questions.

We are Andrew Ahn (co-writer/director) and James Schamus (co-writer/producer) of THE WEDDING BANQUET— a deeply personal, sharply funny, and emotionally rich reimagining of Ang Lee’s beloved 1993 classic.

Here is the trailer:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWy_IzW04YM

Together, we bring decades of filmmaking experience to the table! James is an Oscar-nominated screenwriter and producer behind films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Brokeback Mountain, The Ice Storm, and the original version of The Wedding Banquet. Andrew is a Sundance-winning director whose work like Spa Night, Driveways, and Fire Island explores identity, intimacy, and family, both those we’re born with and those we choose for ourselves, with heart and nuance.

This new version of The Wedding Banquet reflects the world we live in now — from universal, evolving ideas of family and tradition, to the complexities of queer Asian American identity. We’ve poured our hearts into this project, and we’re thrilled to share it with you!

mnl7w1l,1k1ccsy,reddit,"Hey Andrew & James. Thanks for doing this.

As someone who loves the original Wedding Banquet, one of the things that makes that screenplay stand out is that the premise feels primed for 'cheap' humor & the movie refuses to cash in on it. Like if I explained the premise to someone who had never seen it, naturally they would expect hijinks around the parents being constantly on the verge of discovering the 'secret'. But the movie shines because it is more interested in the personal/cultural dynamics at play rather than the parents accidentally walking into the wrong room & someone needing to hide behind a door (or whathaveyou). 

Was this something you kept in mind when writing the new screenplay? Was it something you had to push back on with the studio? 

Thanks again! (PS - James I think Eat, Drink, Man, Woman is a true capital M Masterpiece & I just wanted to say **thank you** for that in particular. It is an all-time favorite of mine.)",2025-04-17 14:19:51,9,Michael__Pemulis,movies

Andrew, were you a fan of the original growing up, or was it a film you discovered later on? Did you use the original a lot as a reference point or did you prefer to do something different? Was it intimating adapting a classic Ang Lee film for a more modern audience?

James, you are a legend! All of your amazing writing/producing accomplishments aside, I really enjoyed **Indignation**. Do you ever get the urge to get back into directing? If so, what kind of project would you like to make next?

I recently had the opportunity to see “Lust, Caution,” for the first time on the biggest movie screen in my home state. I was absolutely astonished, I think it might be some of the best filmmaking in modern history. 


My question concerns the censorship of the film: notably, it was recut for foreign audiences to remove explicit scenes and change the end of the film. Obviously, censoring art is counterintuitive to its purpose, so I guess my question is what is the value in distributing films when the message and story has been compromised? I’m sure it was a really difficult choice, and I’m very curious what those conversations about the artistic integrity of the film looked like behind the scenes.

Despite the completion of filming in 2018, it has undergone a sluggish post-production process, [highlighted by long rumored tensions between director Juno Mak and members of the cast, particularly Kaneshiro and Richie Jen](https://www.todayonline.com/8days/sceneandheard/entertainment/takeshi-kaneshiro-reportedly-feuded-director-movie-which-had-its), whose name has been  absent from recent promotional material, leading to speculation that his scenes may have been cut from the film.  The legendary Japanese music composer Ryuichi Sakamoto was hired to score the film, but he passed away before being able to fully complete his work due to this hiatus, forcing Mak to finish his work with help from Nate Connelly. Originally budgeted at HK$150 million, it has now blown out to HK$400 million thanks to continuous reshootings of scenes and other post-production work, making it the most expensive production in Hong Kong cinema history, surpassing 2023 film the Goldfinger's $350 million. Mak is said to have cut 2-hour, 3-hour and 6-hour versions of the movie and actor Louis Koo said yesterday at the Hong Kong International Film Festival that he had seen a 4-hour cut of the film, but it remains to be seen what version will officially premiere at Cannes next month.",2025-04-11 17:29:51,5,Adventurous_Caramel,movies

mnjp14o,1k158t9,reddit,"The movie would be Mulholland Drive. I watched it for the first time pretty long ago, essentially when it came out, and back then I hated it. It was just too confusing, I could figure out what the hell happened there and just didn't connect with it, at all. And afterwards, for years I kept seeing people praising it, in very extreme terms (""best movie of the decade"", ""in top 25 all time greatest""), and I kept wondering - that thing? Why does anybody like it? What's there to like?

A couple of weeks ago I decided to give it another chance, fully expecting to be disappointed, and a wonderful thing happened: I was starting to love it. It was really gripping, made lots of sense and with every moment I was more engrossed. I was getting what I always want to get out of any movie - something emotionally compelling, something that makes me feel things, not just a movie where you intellectually notice: ""oh, how great and innovative"", while it leaves you cold.

So after I finished I kept thinking about Mulholland Drive as days went by, about Diana's sad-sack life, and about Camilla, and about all the darkness hiding in the shadows of the movie. Scenes kept playing in my head again and again, and finally I decided I had to see it again, you know, to get rid of that terrible feeling and so on. But not at home. Seeing it again at home would be insufficient. I had to see Mulholland Drive in a movie theater. But where? Theaters don't just show oldies on demand. I checked the local theater website without any hope at all and as it turned out they were showing Mulholland Drive, only for one day. Next day. Exactly during the time I could attend. Huh, how surreally convenient. Of course, I went.

The way people behave when I go to see movies is hit and miss. Sometimes it's fine, and other times it's almost as bad as the horror stories you see on reddits here. This time it was great: everyone who came to see the movie were older people who knew why they were there, and everyone was very quiet and focused on the screen. I think the biggest moment that caught everyone dead-still was not any of the more suspenseful scenes like with the Winkies scene or where they find Diana, but rather the moment where Rita's makeover with the wig is revealed in the mirror. Felt like everyone in the audience was afraid to breathe. 

Then as the Silencio scene stated, an old man suddenly decided to shamble out of the auditorium, very, very slowly. ""Poor guy"", I thought. ""Either he's going to miss the coolest part, or he knows the movie and really, really hates musical numbers. Oh well, his loss"".

By the time I had to go home it got dark. The underpass seemed empty and liminal and the city, with all the orange and blue lights felt ominous and properly Lynchian. Everything looked too artfully lit to be real, like a theater stage. It may have been no Los Angeles or Hollywood, but it had creepiness in its own right. I was standing in the bitter cold under a streetlamp waiting for a bus home. In the shadows behind me a man was explaining something on the phone, and it sounded absurd and incoherent. I wondered about the weird, suspicious convenience of just randomly finding a screening exactly when I wanted to. It was then that I realized that actually, the old man in the auditorium had been me, my real self, and I was him dreaming of being younger. In reality, I never did find a convenient screening until many decades later. Then, with every joint aching, I slowly shambled wherever I needed to go.",2025-04-17 07:16:27,2,_Pit_Man,movies

> A parable about the consequences of being a bystander to evil, from a disturbing poem by Maurice Ogden, read by Herschel Bernardi. Shadows and shifting geometric planes lend a Chirico-like quality to Julian's animation. Great musical score by Serge Hovey.
> 
> About the film, Steve Goldman writes: ""Les Goldman was my father. Creating this film was one of the most important accomplishments of his life. He was inspired to make this film after hearing the poem 'Hangman' read on Pacifica Radio in Los Angeles by Les Claypool. My father almost single-handedly raised the money to make the film, with $100 and $200 donations from friends and associates. Paul Julian, Serge Hovey, and Herschel Bernardi were friends and colleagues of my father. He elicited their help in making the film. Though the poem on which the film is based has Holocaust parallels, the poet, Maurice Ogden, was actually writing about America during the McCarthy era. Ogden was an actor and writer who was denied work and persecuted by the House Un-American Activities Committee during the 1950's and early 60's for allegedly having been a member of the Communist Party many years earlier.""

One scene in particular though, after several gut busting laughs, they're about to attempt to bring the monster to life, and then Gene Wilder proceeds to pull off possibly the single best Frankenstein performance/monologue I've ever seen on camera...

Extras stretch into the distance, and finally the full scope of the South’s huge losses hits home, punctuated at the end of the shot by a Confederate flag coming into view, flapping in the breeze yet irreparably damaged.

He's not a naturalistic or subtle actor IMO, his style screams ""Quiet on set! The actor will begin acting now!"" I think his style comes more from that early British classical Shakespearean scene that would have him as the tortured and melodramatic protagonist, with Brian Blessed supporting as Falstaff or something like that. Big acting, big emotions, because there's no camera lingering inches from his face to register subtle facial expressions.

Alternatively, I think if he had come along ten years later, he might have fallen in with someone like David Lynch, who was very much trying to counter program the dominant Hollywood style at the time.",2025-04-22 13:37:39,13,CCLF,movies

mofmny6,1k55hxq,reddit,"I feel like Malcolm McDowell *was* a household name well enough, it's just that he's old now and most of the movies that made him such a name are far enough in the past that you simply don't hear about them that much anymore.

Back in the 90s he was certainly well known among me and mine, for example.  Even the people who didn't know him by name, when asked to name the best movie villains, would regularly cite his roles.

A Clockwork Orange is one for the ages and certainly holds up even today, but how often do you really hear people talking about it?  In places other than movie-focused subreddits, I mean.  It's not that the movie has somehow turned bad, it's just old and people have moved on.

Malcolm McDowell *was great* in his time, but now he's on the trailing end of that slope.  Nothing wrong with that, it's just what happens.  Honestly, the fact that he's still working at his age is remarkable in itself, and shows a true love for the craft, I think.",2025-04-22 14:13:13,2,grumblyoldman,movies

moflqwx,1k55hxq,reddit,"A Clockwork Orange kind of fucked him over.

It's worth keeping in mind that A Clockwork Orange, when it came out, was an *absurdly* controversial movie to the point where a large chunk of the film industry thought it shouldn't exist, wanted it banned, and wanted everyone involved blacklisted. Kubrick's career survived because he was, you know, Kubrick, and even then it floundered a bit. McDowell, meanwhile, had to start basically just taking any role that paid green money, because suddenly nothing good was calling for him; it took a while for him to even start getting *lucrative* bad roles.

It's basically the same problem Eric Roberts ended up having. He was in Star 80 and gave what was generally considered an incredible performance... but because that performance involved committing on-screen necrophilia in a movie about the brutal rape and murder of a Playboy playmate, he basically got thrown out of Hollywood ass-first regardless and most of his career is direct-to-video garbage.",2025-04-22 14:08:20,4,GatoradeNipples,movies

mlrtmti,1jt3bff,reddit,"I don't have any names to add that haven't already been posted, but the thing that's always been interesting to me about this topic is that whenever you see the names listed of the most horrific directors in Hollywood to work with, it's almost always a list filled with absolute legends of cinema. Hitchcock, Kubrick, etc. People who did a lot of horrible things that absolutely deserve condemnation, but who were so good that they can't have their artistic greatness denied by many, nor can their issues ever overshadow their output.

On the other hand, when you hear about directors who are adored by actors and crews because of how great they are to work with, it seems to play out differently. Two of the names I've seen pop up the most often as the best to work with are JJ Abrams and Zack Snyder. Guys who are, safe to say, widely revilved by the majority of internet film fans, and who are both consistently denied any kind of artistic credit for their films.

Now, the point of my post isn't to say that only difficult artists make great art, or anything like that. In fact, I don't even really know what my point is. I guess I just find it fascinating that the directors who most everyone agrees were some of the biggest shitbags in history must still be remembered for their wonderful art, but the guys who have consistently been branded some of the nicest, most caring, most professional, most *human* in the industry must have their character repeatedly assassinated for the unforgivable crime of having mismanaged popular IP in film.

As an aside, I'm not implying that there are no directors who are also consistently considered to be wonderful people as well as worthwhile artists. David Lynch immediately comes to mind. I've just found the consistency with which ""bad"" directors are considered great people and which ""great"" directors are branded horrific monsters to be a really fascinating dichotomy in the arts, and one which also seems to pop up often in music, painting, video games, and pretty any other form of art.",2025-04-06 22:32:27,14,Dynastydood,movies

Lost bullet 3. The first two are some of my favourite action movies. Some insane car stunts. 

Avatar fire and ash. Many people ask who are these even for. I’m one of the people who like the franchise not just for the spectacle but the characters too. Can’t see where they go 

Fantastic four first steps. 

Weapons. Very curious what Creggor has planned since barbarian. Love the cast 

Return to silent hill 

Nobody 2 unlike a lot of people while I didn’t hate the first movie the third act really lost me. I think the new director is a huge improvement for me personally so I’m optimistic 

The black phone 2 I know some people were lukewarm on the film but I loved it 

Bring her back. Talk to me was such a pleasant surprise for me. Glad the brothers are making something new and original 

After the hunt the premise isn’t super interesting to me but this director hasn’t really disappointed me yet in any major way. Love the cast.

I had been something of a bit of a “little bitch” when it came to horror films as a little kid, but middle school was when they really started clicking with me and started to become my favorite genre.

And, oh man, were those some great years.  The tail end of the modern/meta slasher revival, but before the gore/torture porn took over the genre.  Films like “The Faculty”, “The Sixth Sense”, “Bride of Chucky”, “The Blair Witch Project”, “The Mummy, “Idle Hands”, “Sleepy Hollow”, “Pitch Black”, and the topic at hand, “Final Destination” all formed the foundation of what made me a horror fan.    That turn-of-the-Millennium, pre-9/11 era of Horror was truly fantastic era for the genre.

On FD itself.   Absolutely loved it and its initial couple of sequels.  It still has that Kevin Williamson sheen of late 90s horror, but didn’t wear it as strong as a film like “Urban Legend” or “I know What you Did Last Summer” and let its rube-Goldberg kill sequences shine.   

I think its direct sequel improved upon the formula, but would still rank this one at #2 overall in the franchise.  Behind FD2, just ahead of FD5 and leagues ahead of TFD/FD4 (utter garbage).",2025-03-28 06:33:07,3,GRVrush2112,movies

Absolutely fantastic films and really appreciate the levels of creativity and storytelling.

Would almost say it's perfect - but the issues with Crispin Glovers redundancy (not that he's a major part of 2 or 3 anyway) and Jennifer's odd recasting and relegation to an alleyway for 2 films hold it all back from perfection.

Fantastic series of films. Really feel good vibes.

3 was always my favourite. 2 always confused me as a child because I couldn't figure out which film I was watching. Also was lucky enough to ride BTTF at universal studios which is still the best ride I've been on.",2025-04-13 09:40:56,14,No-Comfortable6432,movies
mmusnqw,1jxvqxf,reddit,"I'm gonna go against the grain here and say I completely agree, all three movies make the perfect trilogy. The first is great as it's own story, yet the other two only enhance it and take nothing away. They all have very similar scenes, tropes, and characters that tie them all together yet each tell very different stories and have lots of creative conflicts that keep you hooked. Marty Mcfly and Doc Brown are a fantastic duo, and have great chemistry. They play off of each other perfectly. I love how Mcfly is constantly the underdog who is in over his head, yet through luck or cleverness, manages to overcome the odds. Doc Brown is so expressive and endlessly entertaining to watch, providing both laughs and heartfelt moments. Biff is one if the most entertaining antagonists ever IMO. 

Most of all, they are a period piece that is somehow timeless and accessible to audiences of all kinds. It is up there with The Matrix as my favorite Scif Fi series of all time. I love them more than even Star Wars.",2025-04-13 06:00:12,30,choren64,movies

A director who made something great to start and then fell off: 

**Marc Webb** (though I don't know if I'm ready to say say he's ""bad"").

I don't think *Amazing Spider-Man 2* was his fault, and I'd rank the first *Amazing Spider-Man* as a good movie, but *(500) Days of Summer* was such an inventive revitalization of the romcom (among many other touches, I loved the split-screen ""expectations/reality"" scene, which I know Webb used in a music video first but still) ... that it's a little surprising he's been so mediocre/middle-of-the-road since.

*Gifted* was okay; *The Only Living Boy in New York* was pretty bad; and then, while I don't want to attract the insane people here, I think it's fair to say that, while *Snow White* is definitely getting review bombed, it's still not a good movie.",2025-04-03 19:44:02,50,dtfulsom,movies

You might think it’s just a hiccup, but the rest of his filmography is wildly inept. Captivity is horrendous. Not just a film that no one really wanted, but the basic mechanisms of plot and filmmaking are out the window at that point.

The special editions also show he doesn't understand the basics of filmmaking or at least forgot about them.

He takes a topic that is epic, then focuses on something common and mundane and spends 80% of the screen time on that.

Signs is about alien invasion - focuses on a pastor and his loss of faith.

Sixth Sense -  good because it actually focused on what the plot was about, a kid that sees ghosts. He almost tries to veer off about the psychologist and his marital problems but realized the more he does the less of a twist it is at the end.

Lady in the Water - about fairies folk in the real world? focuses on the maintenance man and a bunch of weird tenants and their hang ups.

Split - Super Beings exist in the real world - let's focus on a mental health condition that regular people suffer from.

I love that the movie isn't afraid to be so murky in the initial ethics of the relationship. 

Duke of Burgundy is another film that explores relationship dynamics within a (quirky) kink setting. That I highly recommend. 
Another Spader classic is Sex Lies and Videotape, which also explores non-conventional relationship dynamics in an interesting way.

mklvf3u,1jm9jye,reddit,"For other movies similar to Secretary it depends on what you’re looking for. Many great recommendations in this thread for films about BDSM/sexuality. I didn’t see anyone mention Lars Von Trier’s Nymphomaniac (vol 1 + 2) - you follow a woman coming to terms with her sexuality over her life (and how it changes). It’s a lot grittier than Secretary though. 

You mention loving Lee. She is my favorite part of Secretary, and I think the character I relate to the most from any piece of media. If you enjoy Lee’s narration, her fantasy world, the colors, her relationship with her family - I also really recommend The Lovely Bones. It’s not a romance and it centers on the aftermath of the rape and murder of a teenage girl, but it also uses vibrant colors and explores Susie’s memories and desires beautifully.

And it not bring rated r held this back, you had a concept and idea what could had been basically the closest we got to a Turok film and what it should have been.


And aside from the t-rexes. The dinosaurs were inaccurate, and the fact it lacked herbivores. I don't know why they dropped the original idea of accurate dinosaurs and actually featuring herbivores. This was potential to show herbivores can be as dangerous as carnivores. Since instead of a four-legged theropod it was going to be a triceratops.

mlsonme,1jt8ou5,reddit,"Not a big slasher movie fan but I would imagine Nightmare on Elm Street and Halloween qualify here.

Freddy Krueger, the antagonist in Nightmare on Elm Street, went from being an iconic dark villain in the first few films to a complete parody later on in the series after appearing on MTV as a big celebrity.

They even made a meta film where he kills the real life actress lol

Can you say flanderization???

Halloween was supposed to be an anthology series originally but they brought back Michael Myers, the killer in the first 2 films, due to his popularity after Seasons of the Witch flopped. 

The larger narrative became super convoluted with some curse of thorn bullshit and they ended up creating different timelines, one of which was them erasing his niece from the picture after building the past two films around her.

Jamie Lee Curtis’s character Laurie Strode, who is Michael’s sister,  
dies in one timeline but somehow appears in the sequels 😂

First off. Stop casting Awkafina in everything! I'm so tired of seeing her everywhere. I wouldn't be surprised if they casted her as the voice for Amy Rose in Sonic 4.

Second fuck Zhen, I hated her character.

Fuck Mike Mitchell for butchering the original directors idea of the film being more in tone to the first two films.

This is how I would have done it honestly.

Zhen isn't real. The whole time she was a persona disguise the Chameleon was using traveling with Po and using him. Also no Awkafina, so fucking sick of seeing her in everything. The idea too that Po would learn from Shifu that he was right never to trust everyone you meet.

I don't think her dog transformation was supposed to be mental illness, because there were physical symptoms her husband noticed - but it doesn't seem to make any difference at all in her life in the end.

moi6xmd,1k55u1w,reddit,"Congrats; its by far the best of them. Lupin often gets compared to Bond (for obvious reasons) but one thing in common is that the majority of the movies aren’t particularly great, we just remember them for certain great moments in between other, more indulgent/ridiculous/regrettable moments, and you still know what you’re getting even in a worst case scenario and it’s generally acceptable.

Mystery of Mamo has some great stuff but feels janky compared to Cagliostro, and Fuma Conspiracy has some great sequences and feels like a fresh new perspective on the series, so those are the only two I’d put near Cagliostro. Dead or Alive is like the Dalton Bond movies; grittier and more of-its-time but a lesser version of its contemporaries its trying to match. The 00s specials suffer similarly (perhaps their analogue is the Brosnan Bond movies) where they’re mostly style over substance.

I’d argue most TV series of Lupin (yes, even janky 1st and pink jacket 3rd) are better than most Lupin movies/specials.",2025-04-22 21:47:10,4,kingradness,movies

moig0kv,1k55u1w,reddit,"It's interesting among his films because it's unusually based on someone else's characters, but all the ways it's *not* like the source material make it clearly Miyazaki's. When Cagliostro gets in a little flying machine, or the story resolves the way it does, I thought ""well, of course"". The 'cartoon logic' bits like Lupin jumping to the tower and the flash grenade fight are also nice touches.

Miyazaki may have worked on the show but he definitely had a different idea of what the characters were like then the people making the show before and after him did. 

Now Lupin can be a lot of things, the various anime involving the character have ranged from Comedy to deadly serious sometimes even just in the space of a few episodes of a series. but personally I like the characters with a little bit more of an edge then this movie has, and honestly this movie probably has the ""softest"" version of the cast ever.

First is when the killer is exposed. >!Realising that Ransom had planned to trick her into killing Haran and had also murdered Fran, Marta tricks him into a confession. It's even more impressive since Marta pukes when she lies - she hates Ransom so much at that moment that she's able to successfully suppress her gag reflex until he admits to the murders (and pukes all over him).!<

Then, there's the ending. >!Now that she realises that the Thrombeys have been nothing but mistreating her and hiding behind false pleasantries, Marta's ready to cut the bastards off completely, taking Harlan's inheritance without a shred of guilt or remorse.!<

Some other good examples of this that aren't films...

In the second Ace Attorney game, Phoenix Wright is not only put through the wringer by an utterly despicable villain during the last case, his partner Maya has been kidnapped by an assassin to force him to go along with the villain's plans >!of framing an innocent woman for the murder his client Matt Engarde commissioned from said hitman.!<

In revenge, Phoenix reveals in court to the hitman that >!Matt placed a hidden camera in the room and recorded the murder with intent to blackmail the hitman!<, causing the notorious and famously lethal hitman to turn on the villain. As a result, the villain ends up begging to be convicted of the murder and confesses then and there to be sent to prison to avoid the hitman's wrath.

In Miraculous Ladybug, the end of Season 5 is triggered by an utterly ferocious one.

Sabrina has been the lackey of school bully Chloe since long before the start of the series, but after a brief stint where it looked like Chloe was going to undergo a redemption arc, she regressed into an even bigger bully than before and, worse than that, became a willing henchwoman of the show's primary villain alongside other bully Lila. After being abused by Chloe one too many times and forced to do something she is utterly horrified by by Chloe and Lila - >!forging school documents to utterly ruin the academic careers of her classmates!< - she decides that enough is enough and goes to Marinette, who has been kind and generous to her despite Sabrina being an accomplice to Chloe's bullying, to ask for her help.

>!The two then make it appear that the girls' bathroom at the school is out of commission, which causes the school to bring in a temporary out-building to use as a bathroom instead. They swap out the mirror for one that lets people see what's going on from outside and hide a microphone in there as well. And then, Sabrina tricks Chloe and fellow henchwoman Lila into discussing the plan to fuck over the entire student body within the bathroom, exposing their crimes to the entire school.!<

End result is that she exposes them as villains and ruins their lives completely - Lila has to go on the run >!after being exposed as a professional con artist!< and Chloe, who had abused her pushover of a father's authority as mayor of Paris to do whatever she wanted, ends up not only causing her father to resign from office in complete disgrace but is exiled from Paris completely, forced to live in New York with her extremely abusive mother.

Also, one of these is what kicks off the main plot in Persona 5.

Even after stumbling upon the Metaverse and learning they can force their abusive teacher Kamoshida into feeling guilt and confessing to his litany of abuses against the student population - which include breaking Ryuji's leg due to the track team overshadowing the volleyball team and leaking the main character's criminal record - the MC and Ryuji are highly reluctant to do so, as it's basically just a form of severe brainwashing as well as the fact that Morgana warned them that it could be fatal to the bastard if they screwed it up.

Then they witness >!a girl attempting to kill herself by jumping off the roof and learn Kamoshida raped her, and the reason he did so was to take out a petty grudge on a different girl for not sleeping with him!<.

mosh4aw,1k6rpwx,reddit,"I'm an animator so i have a bit of a genre bias--but there are three scenes that absolutely blow my entire mind every single time I see them and they ALL live rent free in my brain:

1. In the prince of Egypt, when Moses is coming back from seeing the burning bush and tells his wife about it, there's no dialogue, just a gorgeous hans zimmer score, and you see her confused about why he's so excited, and then you see her just... so... slowly... sit down and take in what he's saying. Absolutely gorgeous and such an incredible example of animation characterized entirely by movement and music. No dialogue necessary. Amazing

2. In ratatouille, in the scene where all the rats are working in the kitchen together and when the health inspector arrives, where there's a huge shot of the whole kitchen, and there are hundreds of little rats doing little rat cooking things, and I just have to pause and appreciate the amount of detail in it. I always notice a new rat doing a new cooking thing and they're all so fun and entertaining

3. In the Lion King (1994, obv), the circle of life sequence and the wildebeest stampede are two of the most incredible examples of color, light, composition, movement, atmosphere, voiceover, and sound working together *perfectly* and I don't know that they'll ever be topped, at least in animation


Edit: also if we're talking about PoE obviously the plagues scene also absolutely slaps but people talk about that enough and not anywhere close to enough about Moses reacting to the bush with his wife


Edit: alright now I feel lame only doing cartoons and everyone has already mentioned ass to ass and the ending of arrival so I'm gonna go with something not as emotionally taxing and say the final performance in school of rock",2025-04-24 14:03:58,24,beaniesfordays,movies

motoy5b,1k6rpwx,reddit,"The scene between Rocky & Mickey in the first Rocky movie (1976)


Mickey has been disrespectful & cold to Rocky throughout the movie with his negativity towards Rocky venturing on cruel as he gave Rocky's locker of 6 years to some palooka. 


When it is announced that Rocky will be taking on the heavyweight champion of the world Apollo Creed, Mickey lightens up his behaviour, swallows his pride & visits Rocky at his home & tells him he wants to be his manager. Cynics would say Mickey was trying to ride on Rocky's coattails  - & they would be wrong. Mickey was a talented boxer in his youth who got screwed over in life because he had no one to guide him. As an elderly man he knows the fight game in & out & realises Rocky has been selected because he would seem like an extremely easy opponent for Apollo. Mickey doesn't want Rocky to get hurt but presumably he also recognizes there is a warrior in Rocky waiting to get out. Rocky rejects Mickey's offer to become his manager because of the pain Mickey put him through earlier. The scene of Mickey leaving Rocky's home almost in tears is beautiful & heartbreaking & Rocky's outburst is truly a tour de force of fire & anger.... a terrific, oscar worthy piece of acting from Sly


...but what got me is that when Rocky has got everything off his chest & made Mickey listen to him, he instantly regrets hurting the old man emotionally & presumably realises he needs Mickey's help. Theres a beautiful long shot of Mickey walking off into the night & Rocky running after him. Mick jumps because he either thinks Rocky's gonna attack him or that he was a mugger. We don't hear what is said but we get the impression Rocky apologises then hugs Mick & accepts his offer to train him. They shake hands, walk off & wave. It's a terrific scene that shows Stallone's talent for getting to the emotions of a film & its characters. We dont hear what they discuss exactly & the scene is all the better for it with Bill Conti's beautiful music soaking in.


It's my favourite scene from any movie. ",2025-04-24 17:32:58,2,DocJamieJay,movies

The original was 90% intellectual comedy poking fun at religion, human desires and fallibility. The remake was 0% intellectual, and made a point of avoiding any religious humor or critique, and seemed to be all about, “what wacky slapstick situation can we put the main character through next”.

The only advantage the remake had over the original is production values, as you might expect for a film with a budget of $48,000,000… compared to the original film’s budget of $600,000.",2025-04-09 19:53:53,-4,OriginalAcidKing,movies

Can you say a bit more about what you think makes it a good remake? Or how you’d compare the two versions?

I’m curious to hear from someone with quite a different experience of them.

Personally, I was pretty surprised when it came out because I assumed it would star another comedy double-act. And have another interesting and unusual characterization of the Devil.

It’s clearly a pretty successful and popular comedy film on its own. So they must have done it right.

But at the same time, I can’t help feeling that it didn’t do as much as it could have with the premise of the original.",2025-04-09 19:41:34,0,Doubly_Curious,movies

And then there's cameos by many others, like Jack Benny, King Donovan, Jerry Lewis, and more.  

I mean, it's about 2 hours too long, and most of the jokes and references to those stars and cameos are going to depend on how familiar you are with those people, but it's pretty impressive.

Information from the filmmakers:

Trailer:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-373fptEXI

Hi r/movies! I am Matthew Rankin, co-writer/director/actor of UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE the new Oscilloscope Laboratories movie that won the first ever Audience Award at Cannes Directors' Fortnight, and was shortlisted for an International Oscar nomination. You can watch it now on home digital VOD platforms!

We'll be back at 12 PM ET tomorrow (Tuesday 4/8) to answer any questions you may have. Feel free to ask away in the meantime.

With me are my co-writers/actors Pirouz Nemati and Ila Firouzabadi, and our producer Sylvain Corbeil!

Synopsis: In a mysterious and surreal interzone somewhere between Tehran and Winnipeg, the lives of multiple characters interweave with each other in surprising and mysterious ways. Gradeschoolers Negin and Nazgol find a sum of money frozen in the winter ice and try to claim it. Meanwhile, Massoud leads a group of increasingly-befuddled tourists through the monuments and historic sites of Winnipeg. Matthew quits his meaningless job in a Québecois government office and sets out upon an enigmatic journey to visit his mother. Space, time and personal identities crossfade, interweave and echo into a surreal comedy of misdirection.

mlxx5nd,1jtuf9y,reddit,"Hey Matthew, thanks for doing the Q/A - as an aspiring filmmaker, I jumped at the opportunity to make an account to ask some questions:

1.  I read in an interview that you and Pirouz were connected by Sylvain about a decade ago when you first wrote the script for UL, but given they're credited writers on the film, I was wondering how long before you started ***filming*** were Ila and Pirouz given the script to revise, and how much of the script changed once they were attached? Was the film always about a Canadian Winnipeg influence by Iran, or was that something they brought to the table?
2. I've heard you know some Farsi, but how were you able to direct the Farsi scenes of the film without proper fluency in the language? (Practically speaking)
3. Will we see more of Ila and Pirouz in the press? Would love to see them take more of an active role in the marketing of the film given they're actually Iranian.
4. Do you think white actors should be able to play characters of color more freely? (This isn't facetious, I'm asking earnestly given you've done it once in a short film, and twice in Universal Language)

Thanks for your time. Looking forward to your answers.",2025-04-07 22:46:16,10,AgilityIngenuity,movies

There's obviously a lack of Iranian representation in films and TV shows but the rare instances where our stories get to be told, there's an unfortunate tendency for it to be done by non-Iranians.

In Universal Language, you mix Iranian and Canadian cultures to create an alternate reality (I really liked the Tim Hortons Tea House) that is equally funny and melancholic.

mlx07lz,1jtuf9y,reddit,"Hello r/movies! I am Matthew Rankin, co-writer/director/actor of UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE the new Oscilloscope Laboratories movie that won the first ever Audience Award at Cannes Directors' Fortnight, and was shortlisted for an International Oscar nomination. You can watch it now on home digital VOD platforms!

We'll be back at 12 PM ET tomorrow (Tuesday 4/8) to answer any questions you may have. Feel free to ask away in the meantime.

With me are my collaborators. Writers / actors / exec producers  Pirouz Nemati and Ila Firouzabadi and producer Sylvain Corbeil!

Synopsis: Somewhere between Tehran and Winnipeg, the lives of multiple characters interweave with each other in surprising and mysterious ways. Gradeschoolers Negin and Nazgol find a sum of money frozen in the winter ice and try to claim it. Meanwhile, Massoud leads a group of increasingly-befuddled tourists through the monuments and historic sites of Winnipeg. Matthew quits his meaningless job in a Québecois government office and sets out upon an enigmatic journey to visit his mother.

But in the end of the movie it was said that in real life the girls were never actually found and no one really knows what happened, so I went through that imagined shit for nothing.

If we're talking sheer, over-the-top blood and guts, I'd probably have to say Piranha 3D. Alexandre Aja makes violence look truly NASTY. Every kill is so over the top, but the beach feeding frenzy is disgusting. The two sequences that haunt me are the girl getting her hair stuck in a boat motor and then having her face ripped off, and the one girl who's got so little flesh remaining that the people trying to rescue her accidentally rip her in half.

If we're talking pure, visceral nastiness, then I think the Evil Dead remake takes it. That movie is INTENSE, and the gore effects are fucking wild. The girl cutting her face open and the xacto knife sequence make my skin crawl.

Honourable mentions to Hostel, Saw 3 through 6 and X, Martyrs (for pure nastiness moreso than buckets of gore), Rambo 4, Cannibal Holocaust, Berserk Golden Age Arc part 3, When Evil Lurks, The Sadness, Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning, Day of the Dead, Green Room (again, for sheer nastiness rather than buckets of blood).",2025-04-18 17:44:40,2,Barloq,movies

mm3xim7,1juoovm,reddit,"Not live-action, but I recommend the anime movie **Vampire Hunter D** (1985). There's not a whole lot to the story, but I love the ambience. It's set in the very distant future (12,090 A.D.) on a post-apocalyptic Earth, where everything is barren, monsters and mutants run rampant, but technology still exists in a sense.  
  
A young girl named Doris is marked to become the bride of Count Magnus Lee. Afterwards, Doris hires a vampire hunter, simply named D, to kill the count and spare her the fate of becoming his wife. But there are other characters who come out of the woodwork, both on the count's side and in Doris' village, who try to vie for power and control.  
  
The style of art and animation is something of a time capsule in itself, and you can't really find that kind of aesthetic anymore. It's dark, but not too grim, a little violent and gory, and has just enough eeriness to give it that extra sense of mystique. The movie is based on a long-running novel series that's also available domestically, if the movie pique's your interest enough to check it out.",2025-04-08 21:47:03,21,I-Have-Spoken-528491,movies

One complaint was that Pedro Pascal basically didn't do anything except get his ass kicked.

But then the next time we see him he's already subdued, and seems to have gone down without a fight.

It could've been made into its standalone movie to be honest. I didn't care for the Sleepy Floyd portion of the movie, but it's a good payoff to everything else besides the 2nd chapter. Lots of good dialogue throughout the movie also.

More A-List actors than I expected, which is crazy because this movie is severely under-marketed. Guess all of the budget went into giving those A-List actors screen time. Tom Hanks had a good 3-5 minute scene then vanished. Didn't realize Barbie, the character from Chapter 2, played a Riri Williams in Black Panther 2.

I did not expect to have a sequel there. The original one was fun so maybe this one will too.

The first one was a wasted potential. At least this one has Karl Urban so there is one reason to see it.

I forgot that we will actually get a new Tron movie. And Gillian Anderson is there! Yeah

I think it is time to rewatch the original. Movies with Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner were always a blast. We don't really have a duo like that nowadays.

The cast in this new one is great, I hope this one will be fun!~

The combination of cast and director is very promising. Looking forward to that one.

Flashpoint starring Donnie Yen and Collin Chou, especially the final fight scene. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhSsl4sErz0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhSsl4sErz0)

The final fight shows something that's pretty rare in action movies. When Donnie Yen's character starts getting his ass kicked, he doesn't win with luck, by doing something tricky, or through sheer determination. Instead, he changes fighting styles, changes tactics, and keeps his opponent off balance. Then he ultimately wins by beating the shit out of the dude who was beating him up minutes before.

It's also a little rare to see an action movie hero use multiple distinct fighting styles, which Yen does in this movie.",2025-04-15 21:16:54,2,TJ_McWeaksauce,movies

At least after his wacky 60-early 70s stuff most are entirely dialogue-focused, so depending on the busy-ness of the day I could usually follow along perfectly well with the story and character arcs.

I’d also just recommend movies you’ve seen before. Recently on WFH days I’ve been going through my DVD/BR collection and even when I can’t really follow an action scene because I have stuff to do, I’m not missing anything because I’ve seen it.

I wouldn’t recommend action movies you haven’t seen, visual stuff is harder to keep track of while working and even if they’re dumb visuals like in Transformers or Fast 9, they’re still visuals.",2025-04-20 20:58:14,4,KennyShowers,movies

mk547bi,1jlkdi0,reddit,"I really really enjoyed this movie. Was surprised to find out others didn't feel the same! Everything is purposeful, everything is perspective - small clues reveal what's really going on. It's not a movie that holds your hand and explains exactly what is happening - you have to piece it together yourself as more gets revealed. The more you think, the more you realize; everything connects, and every small detail is extremely purposeful.

Some things seem strange or out of place, until you ask yourself why. Why is THAT person seeing a situation that way and the others aren't? Why would they do that in XYZ situation? What's real? What's not? Once you piece it all together, it's a fantastically displayed movie about extreme mental health anxiety and trauma.

I think a lot of people are misinterpreting the ending.
Here's why:
>! She doesn't commit suicide. The reverse signature is not revealing that she is in the 'reverse' world, but rather that she is accepting the fact that she is living with this other 'person' inside of her. She painted it in reverse on purpose. She scolds her daughter for writing the R in reverse, just as she violently tries to shield herself and her children from her mental health disorder (getting rid of the bad parts). With the painting revealed, she shows that she is reclaiming her life (as supported by the 'we will be ready. I will be ready' comment).
The reverse world doesn't exist. The lady outside doesn't even exist. The fact that she doesn't take her medication in the beginning sets up the entire movie. What started the whole plot of the woman outside was the daughter. The daughter sees sheets moving in the wind, imagines a woman out there and gets scared, and that's when the main character's delusions start attaching to that idea. All of her delusions are like this - we see her look or reference something, then her mind latches on to it and cranks it to a wildly absurd extreme.
She is ultimately afraid that she will be a danger to herself and her family. This is exasperated by the fact that she's trying her best to push aside her suicidal ideation and grander delusions.
The biggest clue is why she stopped painting. Her daughter asks why she stopped painting, to which she responds that she will continue once she has something beautiful to paint. In that moment, when she held the gun in the attic - she looked in the mirror and saw something that gave her purpose. She saw the beauty in NOT pulling the trigger. She sees the beauty in fully accepting what is happening to her, and snaps back into reality.
What really sets this in for me is: 1. The boy fell asleep looking out of the window. He is used to his mom's delusions, and knows he has to play into them a bit so she doesn't get uncomfortable and angry. 2. At the end, when they run, they don't go asking the neighbors to call the police; they call the electric company. The son knows what's happening (saying she takes crazy pills out of anger) and knows there is no external danger. 3. When we see her reverse in the attic going towards the girl, that is from the boys perspective. The boy sees that her mom is NOT in control, but has a part of her trying to stop her other self (referenced by the shadow). The girl doesn't understand, and so sees her mom with some form of mal-intent behind her actions.!<

Overall, I rate this movie a 9.3/10. Definitely a must watch if you like to be an active viewer.",2025-03-28 05:58:49,55,TheMegaExplosion,movies

mkaeuaz,1jlkdi0,reddit,"I had a different interpretation. I thought her praying for strength came in the sense of death providing a reality check for her. She had been grieving and clearly struggling to be a mother, that death (the woman) came to provide an inverted self-reflective moment where she was able to look in on herself and her parenting at the moment. I also think the concept of invertedness is also emphasized in her frustration at the backwards R her daughter kept writing; it was frustrating because it was a constant reminder that she was alone in parenting in having to deal with a child’s innocence. Later, the idea was conveyed that if she released her children, they would go on and be successful. However, in the end, since she accepted her fate of doing so for her children’s sake, she was in a way pardoned since “the woman” had done her job of getting her to realize the impact being a parent can have on a child. In the end, it was almost like the entire purpose of the woman was to get the woman to realize that she is ultimately in charge of the outcome of her life going forward since she continuously felt “stuck” per the conversation with her husband during dinner. The end of the movie was not a “su*cide” but a rebirth and a renewal of the relationship between her and her kids per the lights coming back on, the continuation of the house progressing, the sign up front, etc.

mliyk2u,1jlkdi0,reddit,"I think the house itself was supposed to represent the woman’s mind. The lights are off, it is dark and messy and all consuming. The woman in the yard is her own suicidal thoughts getting closer and closer to her. The “attic” is the darkest place she can go (mentally). The interactions we see between her and her children are her reconciliations of her own guilt. She resents the son for being like his father. Her daughter drawing a backwards R signifies how she sees herself in her daughter, and it frustrates her. I don’t think she kills herself at the end…

I think what we see when she emerges from the garage is her stepping out of her dark mind and embracing and pulling back in what she pushed away or “freed” during her darkest moments. The lights of the home come back on… aka forward thinking comes back to her and she is pushing ahead. The painting signified her acknowledging and embracing her dark side as beautiful. The farm sign signified her deciding to want to stay and make a home of the place she was resentful of and running from. 

We watched her go through the stages of grief (denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance) in her own mind. It was all just metaphorical. 

I don’t think she killed herself or anyone, including the dog. The leash had a broken link, like someone let the dog loose, just like she let her children loose.

mkfd03c,1jlkdi0,reddit,"To me, the mirror world symbolizes a perfect world—one where struggles like suicidal thoughts don’t win. It’s an idealized reflection of reality, a place where everything turns out the way we wish it would. So, when the story ends on a happy note, it does so because, in a perfect world, that’s how things should be. Suicidal thoughts wouldn’t win. People would always find hope, healing, and a way forward.

But that’s exactly the tragedy of it—because in reality, suicidal thoughts do win sometimes. The mirror world offers an ending that we all want to believe in, but it isn’t the truth for everyone. It highlights the painful contrast between what should be and what is. The happy ending exists only because it’s within the mirror world, almost as if it has to happen there, because real life doesn’t guarantee the same outcome. It’s a reminder that while we long for a world where no one loses their battle with their mind, that’s not always how life works.

ml5gm5r,1jlkdi0,reddit,"I'm mixed on this one. My thoughts:

**What I Liked**

* The jump scares. I know some people hate on them as cheap, but they're a good part of horror movies when done right and not overly relied on. I thought this movie used them well.
* It stayed pretty straightforward. I didn't feel like time was wasted too much. A lot of horror movies these days feel like they dance around the possibility of 3-4 endings before getting to the real one and it can get to be too much. They kept it short and I needed that for once.

**What I Disliked**

* We get it - she feels guilt over the accident. You've shown us this through dialogue, hints, and showing her nightmare repeatedly.
* It did feel a bit obvious that >!the woman would be some form of Ramona. In this case, a manifestation of her suicidal thoughts.!<
* It was super heavy handed in telling you exactly what was going on at every moment. Probably my least favorite part of the movie.

Regarding the matter of the ending and >!whether or not Ramona ended her life!<, my take was that >!she chose not to pull the trigger!<. More spoilers below.

* With how heavy handed this movie was in explaining everything, my assumption was they wouldn't have her end her life and not show us the gunshot.
* The kids ask ""will the woman be back,"" and Ramona responds with something like ""I'm not sure, but I'll be ready."" If Ramona ended her life, wouldn't she say something like ""no, she's not coming back,"" instead? This feels more like her knowing that she's alive, her suicidal feelings aren't going away, but she's learning to cope with them.
* I didn't think the ""Iris Haven,"" sign was an indication of her reaching a perfect afterlife. It felt to me more like her trying to move on, but also with the filmmakers not throwing in an additional ""six months later,"" type of scene.
* I would've assumed she would've seen her husband if she ended her life.

I could be wrong about all of this, but it's just my take.",2025-04-03 04:51:46,3,DJSchwann,movies

Her son was trying so hard to keep the household going and got no credit for it. I felt so bad for him. She felt trapped and trapped her kids too. He was right to be upset. He was doing the best he could to keep his sister and the animals fed but he can't drive to get good. He can't pay the electric bill. His mom rejects any ideas he has and treats him like a child despite him taking on all that. ",2025-04-05 01:10:53,2,veronicarules,movies

That is why the ambiguous nature of the ending is so bad. It's potentially quite dangerous.

You can have a movie about suicide, you can even have a movie where a character kills themselves. But this particular ending is just not safe.

You can still have the grieving mom but change it to the father dying in battle. And... what if there was a battle going on just out of sight from the home. Now there is two threats of danger.

ml3w9bj,1jlkdi0,reddit,"I’m confused by the comments saying she offed herself at the end cause if that’s the case they didn’t do a great job making that clear. I took the painting as her making peace with her troubled mind and a sign that things would be alright in the end. That was actually my biggest gripe of it all, that she DIDNT off herself. It’s really the only ending that made sense to me. It felt like that’s what the writers wanted and believed should happen and then were talked out of it for the final scene or something. As someone who’s dealt with pretty severe depression I saw a bit of empathy in that that you never really see when it comes to that topic. That for some people you don’t come out of it, and in the meantime you destroy so many people’s lives who love you and it’s simply too much for you. That IS the reality for many.  Even her continuing being mean to the son telling them to go so they wouldn’t find her, but in actuality that being an act of love was beautiful.

They should’ve just had her been the woman in the black an older version with a cane to explain the limping and the kids hallucinations, they’re actually grown up like in the pictures. 

As it stands it just feels like a bunch of events happened and then the character maybe or maybe not decided to kys. 

The visuals elevated the story because the plot reliable way too much on the viewer being disoriented to the point where the movie is just convoluted. The Night House is the superior version of what this movie was trying to say.",2025-04-03 21:41:10,1,i_like_2_travel,movies
mlgijpl,1jlkdi0,reddit,"Ramona was pretty unlikeable with not enough background to sympathize in any way. Even when it was revealed that she wanted a divorce, most we got was she didn’t like living in the country, but is that really grounds for divorce? There HAD to be more to the story that we just never got. Her children don’t care for her, Tay especially, but we never got much of a glimpse into why. Do they secretly blame her for their dad’s death, etc. 

Tay immediately believing whatever The Woman told him happened the night of his dad’s death really emphasizes this too. You’re just gonna trust this random, possibly crazy escapee from a nursing home over your own mother? But even after the true story was revealed the only real lie was that she was driving rather than the dad. I figured maybe, to get out the marriage, she had stabbed him or something and then purposely crashed to make it look as if it wasn’t a murder.

The juxtaposition of the children not being as phased as Ramona was about their dad’s death was a little jarring. I get that kids don’t always grasp the concept of death, but I’d think they would be a little more, idk, sad? Especially so since it had only been a few weeks since.

The scene of Taylor getting the gun and locking different doors to keep Ramona inside was really good and nerve-wracking. As was the flashlight spinning around in the attic scene.

On to The Woman: I wish there was no face reveal. Really broke the immersion and the gravitas of this once-masked, unknown entity. I loved her power as it was very Nosferatu-esque, but the fact Tay and Ramona knew immediately how to block her from using her abilities was a little unbelievable. Up until then Ramona hadn’t even seen The Woman use the shadow power, so how would she know they needed to be in darkness. 

More about The Woman - the movie seemingly confirms that The Woman is a figment of Ramona’s psyche, hidden away in the deepest crevices of her mind that she tries to suppress. Therefore, in my opinion, The Woman should have only been visible to Ramona and not the kids. I was really confused on the shot at the end when Ramona and The Woman are sitting on the bed and the camera pans to show us that Ramona is sitting alone, despite the shadows cascading on the walls showing two figures. Lastly, The Woman actually being Ramona was hinted at pretty heavy on, but, once again, the face reveal detracts from that entire concept. 

The ending was pretty disturbing. The shot (pun intended) of Ramona looking in the mirror with the shotgun under her chin as she’s glistening under the moonlight, smiling was hauntingly beautifully, despite what it was depicting.

All in all I liked it. Agree w/ others that it wasn’t super horror but more a family drama w/ horrific elements to it. The less than 90 min run time was the icing on the cake as I didn’t feel like there weren’t any unnecessary scenes to pad it.",2025-04-04 23:23:24,1,silverrenaissance,movies

\-The characters are the teenagers of our time, and they lean into archetypal territory, but they're never caricatures. We never really get to know them, you can't in a horror movie, but we know enough to see that they were crafted to stand the test of time.  
\-Like all scary movies, *Until Dawn* sprinkles in commentary about the nature of grief and fear. However, it doesn't waste too much time trying to have a message, as it knows that isn't what the story is for.  
\-You can't fault ***Until Dawn*** for already dropping hints about a potential sequel; the building blocks of a long-running universe of terror are all there.

The Screenrant review is awful. It's ok to like a bad movie but some of these arguments are strange. You never get to know the characters, but they stand the test of time. What does this mean? Or, the movie doesn't have a message, because that isn't what the story is for. Again, what does this mean? I am no writer but that goes against everything I know about writing.

Nobody would say those lines with a straight face. The actor who plays the jock is almost as bad of an actor as Ali MacGraw. Wooden is an understatement.

Until Dawn - 6/10. This was fine, I guess. Never played the video games, so I have no context as to how the games go or what the story is. Went into this movie after somewhat liking the trailers. Think of this as a mix between “Happy Death Day,” “Haunt,” “The Mist,” and many other films. Its a time loop movie in a haunted house/town, and it pits its characters against their fears. They need to escape before the hour glass runs out in order to see the dawn of a new day. David F Sandberg returns to horror after detouring with the “Shazam” films. He goes back to basics, and it seems he’s more comfy in a horror setting. Some of the death scenes are creative I guess, and there’s some interesting elements here in terms of the fears of the person manifesting into what is attacking them. Also, the town growing as they stay more and more in the loop was interesting too. Sandberg also does a good job of making the camera phone video scenes feel like a cutaway part in a game, so I guess that’s a plus. But my god was acting so wonky and caricatured. Some points in the movie felt like I was watching a CW show with the acting being in that realm. But yeah, as a film this is just passable in entertainment.

After months of being an anti-Craig, pro-Timothy Dalton fanboy & fearing the worst, for some reason I just knew, from the first few b&w seconds onwards that a masterpiece was unfolding & that Daniel Craig was gonna redefine the character of James Bond for a long time. He was charismatic, witty, likeable but also strangely tragic too. He was also hard as nails in both the movie & in person & for the first time in my cinema going days we suddenly had a James Bond worthy of his licence to kill & was very, very dangerous indeed.


Joker (2019). I was expecting something like Heath Ledger's Joker: The Movie but instead I got something SO profound. The fact I enjoyed the movie so much really excited me to the point I went in to see the movie a second time straight afterwards  - something I've never done with any other movie.

mndoteg,1k0fn3e,reddit,"Cynthia is great and there are many fun movies with her but like someone else on here said, she was a small lady beating up big guys which isn't believable at all and on top of that she wasn't the best or the most charismatic actress. In her movies she often doesn't even get to be the one to win the day. It would usually be her male co-star like Richard Norton that beat the final boss which was dissapointing.

As much as I love her, I don't agree with her being the best martial arts star of all time. If we're only looking at women, then maybe but even then that's probably not the case. She's probably my favourite actress and I've seen 30 of her movies but I'm not surprised at all that she didn't break out into the mainstream. Also, I don't think working with Albert Pyun would've helped her. I really like the guy's movies and I'm sure a film of his with Cynthia would've been fun as hell but it would've most likely been straight to video shlock and not something to make Cynthia more of a star.",2025-04-16 09:14:36,17,Chance_Boudreaux22,movies

Michelle had her career like Rothrock elsewhere, but she was well positioned for the US’s swing towards “authenticity” in terms of martial arts and race.

Cynthia had all the bonafides but was on the wrong side of the public through no fault of her own.  That doesn’t mean she can’t be cast by someone who knows the history, just she’s unlikely to move the needle of the general public.

I am somewhat surprised Yeoh hasn’t asked to have her in anything with her during this dream run she has had, but we have no idea if she had a positive experience with her in Yes, Madam.",2025-04-16 17:37:10,2,azzers214,movies

The reason why the first movie works is because of the subversion of the action genre of the time and the whole vietnam allegory. Everything else they tried has only made the predator less interesting. Less is more.
 
The same thing goes for Alien btw, their insistence of going back to the whole ""the perfect organism"" thing. You can't be a perfect organism if you got a bunch of spikey things on your back, your biggest enemy would be a full coat rack in a tight hallway! 

But first of all, the perfect organism is water bears. Secondly, we don't need any motivation from the evil corporation why they're evil. They're evil! Them sending unsuspecting workers to get the damn alien is enough reason. But, with Disney also being an evil corporation, it is only a matter of time before we get a Weyland-Yutani office workplace sitcom series on Disney+

Anyway, new Statham movie ok. ***Very*** conservative coded, but I had no issues with that even as a lefty. (And I agree that human trafficking is horrendous.) My issues? It's overlong, kinda generic, not nearly as fun-stupid as *The Beekeeper* (though I get why) and feels very, *very* budget at times. (So much so, they don't even *try* to hide that ""cHiCaGo"" is London with some pickup trucks.) Overall, neither Sly's best script nor Statham-Ayer's best work. (At least not until a finale ripped from a much, *much* better picture.)

(Also: >!No, Sly never appears in this as an actor!<. Possibly saved you money.)

There were plenty of positives, though. The gore is great, the ending fucking *rips*, and it's nice to see one of the victims in these fight back for a change. (Daughter was brilliant; really hope she gets more work.) Liked the relationship between Statham and his daughter, too... it was cute. But then it leaves half its subplots wide open for a (presumably) straight-to-Prime sequel. And then I get sad.

Yes the quote above is an actual line said in the movie and it was either written by David Ayer or Stallone. 

The plot is so lame and predictable I was hoping Michael Penã would be the secret villain revealed in the third act or something.  

Also why did Statham seemingly care more about Jenny compared to his own daughter?

And why is David Harbour in this for three minutes?

10/10 did not dissapoint (My expectations of a David Ayer film being dog shit). Am I crazy or were some of the scenes so highly ""stylized"" that it was bordering on indecipherable? Not to mention the whole ""John Wick at home"" vibe...

mk48nz3,1jlkdcp,reddit,"You know, even by the standards set by Statham's movies and knowing he has a pretty built-in audience, this was pretty lame. Really lacks any silliness or ridiculousness that kept the Beekeeper watchable and instead takes itself too seriously but without the quality to match the tone. This is Taken except the guy at the center is barely connected to the girl he's saving and instead of reigniting an actor's action career it's actually the 20th similar movie they've done. In other words, Taken but without the things that make it Taken. 

One might think after seeing the poster of Statham in Carhart gear holding a sledgehammer and a shotgun, not to mention the title ""The Working Man"", that this movie has something to do with the construction job he's working in the beginning. Like, his expertise of that job helps him or his coworkers help him since they all love him so damn much. But this movie drops all of that immediately basically to the point of it never being mentioned again. The sledgehammer from the poster is something he uses for ten seconds *after* all the baddies are dead to help the girl escape, and him working construction has nothing to do with his status as a former Green Beret. 

What's weirder about this movie is whatever Ayer is trying to say if anything. The Beekeeper was similarly coded, badass everyman who isn't really an everyman investigates (punches his way through) somewhat right wing conspiracy theories and finds they go all the way to the top. This movie isn't as blatant as to have a character that might as well have been named Bunter Hiden, but the messaging around the title is a head scratcher.

When the girl gets kidnapped, Pena offers Statham 50k to find her saying he knew he was a Green Beret by the way he carries himself. Statham says no then drives to the woods to talk to David Harbour about it. Obviously he's going to do it, where's the movie if he doesn't, but he's not moving with any urgency at all? He ends up taking 5 days to find her including a sleepover at his blind friend's house and then all these convoluted undercover meth deals that seem totally unnecessary, and the only reason she stays unharmed this long is by plot gymnastics. Ayer is not interested in making this plot makes sense, he's just throwing characters and scenes at the wall and putting them together with no attempt to make it make sense. It's the epitome of bad dialogue and stiff performances but hopefully the audience is just there to see Statham punch so who cares. 

And yes, Statham does punch. But there's really nothing to get into as far as the fights either. One of the more hyped up fights, between him and the meth dealer guy, is over in seconds. There's no shows of force or inventive fight sequences. It's just punchy fights until the final showdown which is just a lot of shooting. You know exactly how this movie will play out before it even starts. And what's the ultimate message? That you should be so thankful to your boss for employing you (a man with clearly endless employable skills) that you should risk your life and murder a lot of people to save his spoiled daughter? This boss that gives his daughter $3,500 to party for a night but doesn't pay well enough for Statham to live well enough to get custody of his daughter? It's not even clear whether or not he accepts the money at the end, all that's important is he saved his boss' daughter. There's no interest in saving anyone else. 

4/10 for me. Lame even by Ayer/Statham standards. If Jason falling asleep to mid fight choreography while wearing Bible verse T-shirts sounds badass to you then, by all means, dig in. I couldn't find much to enjoy here.

It was also pretty confusing, poorly written and paced, way too many bad guys that seemed unconnected, the violence wasn't very entertaining, there was basically no comedy, and a LOT of loose plot threads make me think they are thinking sequel... and for some reason the moon was GIGANTIC like Sephiroth summoned meteor.

Why didn't he just say he would help because they are his family at the beginning when the dad asked him? Why say no and then change his mind later?

mkjiyk2,1jlkdcp,reddit,"Movie is mid but overall entertaining, a 3.5 from me. Wont win any awards but that is fine.

There are still some issues:
Fight scenes were too short and only the chase of Statham in the second act was interesting because he lost and resulted in the short but decent Mercedes ehh van fight. The fight against the AC Biker was too short and dissappointing, expecting him to be some sort of final boss, especially after Statham killed Dimitri before he raided the mansion. The Beekeeper was also shot better, but Statham got hit a couple of times.

Human trafficking was barely touched. Movie teased about a major conspirancy, but at the end all involved government officals were two corrupt swamp sherrifs hat got killed by the Russians at the end for no reason. The DEA information was useless as he didnt tell Statham anything he wouldnt have find out anyways when he tortured the bartender. The buyer was just some some rich ""perv"" and I dont know why they let him live longer than Dimitri.

Statham's daugther was pointless to the plot and at best only existed to ground his character. Expected her to be kidnapped as well to raise the stacks but I guess that would have been too dark for a movie about human trafficking. The grandpa was also pointless beyond showing us how badass the Russian hangmen were compared to the Gopnik posers.

Dont get why the bikers decides to join the Russians since they only had a economic relation to Dimi and two of them being involved in Dimitris human slavery business the Gang itself apparently were not involved in.

I also dont know how the Russians or Statham found Dimi in his bar, but since this is a bad hideout anyways, I can excuse that as ""obvious location"".

Why did everyone assume that Statham was a paratrooper? I do get that people thought he was ex-military but why did they think he was a para, especially since he was Britsh in this movie while the other vets were American.",2025-03-30 16:43:44,1,SpeerDerDengist,movies

People treated him very differently around the office and that's what inspired the book, which is really the feeling you're taking away from the film on watch being the intended message -- lots of toxic masculinity and commentary on just how little folks are willing to press in moments of discomfort

I finally saw how delusional the male protagonist was and that he never truly respected any of the girl's boundaries and just wanted so desperately to keep the manic pixie dream girl stereotype of her in his mind and fantasies, that he never truly got to know her for who she really is. Now that I was older I had met men who were just desperately seeking a relationship just for the fantasy of it all and not exactly deeply looking at who they want to be with and that only led them on the same path of victimization and idealization just like the protagonist of 500 days of Summer. But yes, the child in me was just looking for a happy ending between the main characters just like in all fairy tales and it was easier to see the fault only in one of them instead of in both of them because I needed a hero and a villain, but it turned out that life is not so black and white.",2025-04-18 11:53:35,25,Strong_Meal7889,movies

Did you speak to that?  If you did, Did you think you were only talking to yourself, and end up chiding yourself for doing so? ",2025-04-24 08:13:56,1,Mediocre_Law_4575,movies

How anyone who's had a modern education is gullible enough to believe in these things is beyond me. It's 2025, not the dark ages. We live in a world of cause and effect, and the scientific minded part of me suspects that some guy killing a chicken while chanting words around a fire will not cause the universe to conspire against me.

Information from the filmmakers:

---------------------------------------------------------------------

More information:

Nina, a young, tempestuous woman, finds herself stranded in the far North. She convinces five men on a bachelor hunting trip, to put her up for a few days. In this masculine microsociety, by turns hilarious and philosophical, Nina starts to feel a sense of belonging she never has before. But a mysterious stranger’s arrival changes the course of this improvised holiday forever. Both raw and dreamlike, Hunting Daze offers up a unique universe where humour, horror, the uncanny, and the sensual combine.

Our film played at SXSW, Fantasia, Sydney FF, KVFF, and more. It's out now in the US and Canada on Digital.

Trailer:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O66TVAcpeFM

Nahéma was also the star of 2019's **Antigone** from French-Canadian director Sophie Deraspe, which won five Canadian Screen Awards (and TIFF's Best Canadian Film Award) and was submited to the Oscars as Canada's Best International Feature Film choice.

Maria was twice-nominated for an Oscar for Best Live Action Short Film (**Fauve** in 2019 and **Brotherhood** in 2020, both from Canada).

This is Annick's feature directorial debut.

For Annick - Do you have any background in hunting? Or just a general interest? Was wondering what made you pick a hunting cabin as the location of the film. I've always wanted to check out SXSW. What was the premiere experience like? Any cool moments/stories from when you went?


For Nahema - **Antigone** was so amazing. Looking forward to catching this film as well. What was it like being the only woman actor on set? Also, I wonder if your prep is any different between a feature film and a short film? Very much looking forward to **Splitsville** as well!


For Maria - I saw that you were nominated for back-to-back Oscars for Live Short Film. That's super impressive! And I bet insanely rare too.

I love that it's all practical effects.  I love the acting, and love the camera shots. I love the use of one point perspective.  The behind the scenes are pretty cool to see how the effects were achieved.

There are some deleted scenes, but honestly they were unnecessary exposition on how the possession worked or a few more tidbits about Tass.  I think it was a great call to cut them.


There is so much subtle for shadowing in the first two scenes, everything comes full circle in the end.  This was a 5/5 for me.

mo42jo3,1k1yl6y,reddit,"Went opening weekend. Was 13. Had read the book. Mostly empty theater.


The big movie for our age group that weekend was Anger Management, which was Adam Sandler at the peak of his star power. Movies tended to stay in theaters for months back then, and you'd go to theaters for the sake of going to theaters, sometimes not knowing what you'd see until you got there. So Holes did better as weeks went on. But if you look it up, it came out in April and wasn't available to watch at home 'til the fall, and its entire north american box office is less than half what Minecraft just did in its first weekend. Adjusted for inflation, it did similar to what Dog Man, another book adaptation, just did. Holes just kinda came and went culturally, and I was disappointed it didn't make more of an impact.


I think some context for the time is that the book was liked and featured in many schools, but not everywhere. It wasn't a universal touchstone. This was also a time when there were plenty of 80's and 90's live action movies for kids/young teens that still played a lot on TV or people rewatched on VHS (or DVD, if your family was a little rich), and a new movie like that was released every couple months. Holes as a movie was critically seen as solid, with a weirdly prestigious adult cast, but kind of an also-ran compared to better kids movies.


It also felt a little tough to categorize. It doesn't really fit any expectations. I think us book fans weren't sure how we felt about it as an adaptation - it was faithful enough that it made you wonder why they made the changes they did, and I remember people suspecting Disney was toning stuff down. Meanwhile, people who didn't know the book thought it was weirdly somber compared to other kids stuff, especially when some of the hype was it being the first movie starring that goofball from Even Stevens. I remember my friend's family came with mine to see the movie, them not knowing the book, and the friend's mom commented that it was depressing. So nobody thought it was bad, but nobody was coming out excited and telling everyone they should see it.


Me and a different friend would just annoy people at school, imitating the song's deep-voiced ""youuuu got to go, dig those holes. A broken man and a withered soul..."" and people had no idea what we were talking about",2025-04-20 16:30:46,2,North_Development_36,movies
mo4ztsy,1k1yl6y,reddit,"My fiancé and I just rewatched this movie today! And I remember seeing it in theatres when it first came out.

It was highly advertised on the Disney Channel (or Family Channel if you’re in Canada like I am) before it came out. Shia LaBoeuf was at the height of his Even Stevens fame so his first big movie/roll outside of it was a big deal at the time. 

The book was also really popular at the time. I remember being so impressed with true to the book the movie was. Every thing was perfect. The only subplot that didn’t make it into the film was Stanley’s dramatic weight loss between when he got to Camp Green Lake to when he leaves but it’s probably a good thing they dropped it instead of trying to use goofy prosthetics or make LaBoeuf gain and lose a lot of weight in a short period of time. 

I also liked how they changed up some of the dialogue to more realistically depict how teenage boys of that time actually talked. It’s overall so good. It’s funny, heartbreaking and compelling at all the right times.  

I’ve heard this movie described as Shawshank Redemption for kids and I couldn’t agree more lol.",2025-04-20 19:27:25,2,femmagorgon,movies

mkppsgi,1jo7p4e,reddit,"Nick Cave's plans for Gladiator II:

>The most talked-about draft of *Gladiator 2* was the bizarre version written by Nick Cave. The film would have followed Maximus through the afterlife and reincarnation. He would become an immortal Roman soldier, cursed to live forever serving the republic and its interests. This included killing Lucius, who Maximus then learns was his son, as well as being sent by the pagan gods to destroy Christianity by killing Jesus Christ and his disciples.

>**The movie would then have followed Maximus through the centuries as a warrior, depicting him fighting in the Crusades, World War II, and Vietnam.** The movie would have eventually ended in modern times with Maximus working at the Pentagon. Perhaps not surprisingly given the wild ideas of the script and its deviation from the original movie, Cave's *Gladiator 2* script was eventually rejected.

I watched the documentary on Jodorowsky's legendary unfilmed Dune.

This is an absolutely idiotic, senseless moral to end the series on, and it completely undermines the series's core idea.

I believe it only exists because of a belief on Trevorrow's part that the ST ought to have ended on the series's fundamental, elegant, and extremely resonant central metaphor being 'built on' or 'moved on' from (I mean this to suggest he was artistically misguided, not that he was conspiratorially trying to reverse the series's central idea).

Fans have obviously discussed and imagined 'Grey Jedi' for decades, but they have always been a terrible idea - at least when they are conceived of as superior, more enlightened versions of Jedi.

However, I don't like the reuse of the first film's ending since it makes no sense for Clark to return back to knock out Rocky (the truck driver) at the diner.

This is a lesser-known movie with Nicolas Cage and Joaquin Phoenix. It deals with pornography and snuff films and murder. 

It's an uneasy film to watch in my opinion and in particular there is a scene towards the end of the film with Cage walking through a house and there is periodic heavy metal music playing and then complete silence. Anyway, for me it's a tense movie and tense scene that always gets to me. 

Also has a really good supporting appearance from James gandolfini",2025-04-14 18:39:36,1,theorangecrush10,movies

I can confirm that exact same Japanese subtitles are present on the previous Echo Bridge blu ray release.",2025-04-01 16:02:00,33,SmokingCryptid,movies
mkvttyn,1joy4oi,reddit,"You brought up a bunch of different issues. But first, I’ve emailed Criterion many times and have always received a response. If it’s not a holiday and it’s been a week with no response, try them again. 

I’ve worked on ADA projects as well as having close friends who work in subtitling, captioning for the hearing impaired, as well as audio description, so I feel this issue strongly for the community. That said, these are all boutique distributors who are only licensing the film properties from the rights owners, typically major studios. Boutiques like Criterion have said the rights owners don’t allow them to add other languages and control all subtitling and captioning that must be approved. I would bet that even in cases where it might be possible, it’s still a huge cost and distributors generally work within the spoken language of their territory as that’s their main market.

I hadn’t heard about the issue with Criterion’s new Godzilla release, but the Japanese company Toho who owns the rights to Godzilla and many Japanese classics is extremely strict and difficult to work with. Criterion’s website says the new discs include “New English subtitle translation”. The Blu-ray.com review explains it: “Optional English subtitles are provided for the main feature. When English is spoken, Japanese subtitles are printed on the film.” It’s certainly limiting to only have translations and not full SDH in English, but I suspect Toho controlled that option here as well. 

Streamers like the Criterion Channel and others do not control the content and once again need to pay a separate license to be allowed to present them on their service. It’s why we got a censored streaming version of The French Connection, via Disney. The content comes as-is and they are not allowed to change the captioning or subtitles. Even if they could, it wouldn’t make sense cost wise because the licensing period is very temporary and a film might only be available for as short as a month. 

With special features, they’re either licensed or created by the distributors like Criterion. I suspect the costs are too much for them to use SDH for all of them, but you could ask them too.",2025-04-01 17:03:35,11,BogoJohnson,movies

mlhmrjr,1jrt46q,reddit,"Zardoz might be the most politically cohesive narrative I’ve seen in film. Rather than being haphazardly arranged and enigmatic, the plot is very intentionally structured to recreate a specific narrative. Let me explain…

This is about a bestial, virile man confronting effete intellectual elites. He represents man in a natural state as compared to their unnaturally prolonged and unrooted existence. His pragmatism, power, and purity is irresistible to them to the point that both sides cannot exist while the other survives. He finds hidden knowledge which elevates his conscious to a new level. He destroys the elites and their world, seeding a bloodline of genetically superior humans, our next evolution. 

If this sounds familiar, that’s because it’s a fundamental narrative of 20th century fascism. If anyone is curious for more of an explanation, I can comment some more. Suffice to say, this narrative can be incredibly compelling and that’s why fascists used it (and still do). If you can dig up a clip of Alex Jones describing the core conspiracy that he believes in, he’ll say that liberal elites want to manipulate us into depopulating the Earth and simultaneously advance technology to the point where they can live forever. If you take his word for it, he thinks people are currently planning to make Zardoz a reality. I’m assuming that Boorman is not a fascist and he’s just fascinated by the power of this story and knew exactly the way to put it to film.

If you love campy 70’s sci-fi and you want something on the opposite end of the political spectrum, try Conquest of the Planet of the Apes. It depicts an America that has restructured its entire society around the institution of ape slavery and the slave revolt that follows.

So they had to do the final scene again the next day while Connery was hungover from the wrap party.

So long story short, I want to live in a world where sh*tty people don't get rewarded and get stuck having to relive a life over and over on earth until they grow up and become a better person. And truly good people get that VIP pass into the better afterlife to the next world.

mob8t66,1k1tsqm,reddit,"I was really looking forward to this. And I did not like it at all. I read that Lily Gladstone said she felt protective of Kelly Marie Tran. And that may be why they felt more like sisters here? Gladstone has had amazing chemistry with other female and male leads (check out Under the Bridge, although don’t it’s not good. But her chemistry with Riley Keough was out of this world. Plus I thought she was great with Leo.) But nothing here. 
 
And Bowen’s plight of millennial malaise felt out of step when everyone else had real problems. Like Min is dealing with potentially being disowned and made poor and he’s actually fine with both. Lee is broke and wants a baby. Angela has serious mommy issues. And Chris… can’t commit and watches birds. And that’s the storyline that gets all the attention. 

I am not one who thinks cheating is the end of a relationship every time. I feel, like here, that it’s often the symptom of relationship troubles. And I am not opposed to exploring that in movies or even showing how sexuality is a spectrum. 

But it was resolved way too quickly with Lee and Angela. (With Min and Chris, Min didn’t seem too bothered since their relationship was in a weird place but Lee was very upset and it wasn’t resolved well.) And I hate the queer lady gets pregnant and it’s a good thing trope. They didn’t actually explore anything. 

And the dragon dance interruption made no sense. It was Angela and Lee that joked about the dragon following them around. And Chris and Min weren’t even at the first event. And it’s not part of Min’s culture to have any separate cultural significance. The callback wasn’t actually a callback that made sense for the couple. 

I love Joan Chen in everything and she was a scene stealer here. One of the few chuckles I had was her taking over the photo shoot. I actually thought it was really interesting to have a mom who makes her daughter’s sexuality all about her. First in a negative way and then in a toxically positive way. I haven’t seen that explored much. But it does happen. But even that didn’t get explored much. 

Also loved the grandmother. Especially her immediately figuring out what is going on. 

I thought it would be funnier. I thought it would be more about queer joy.  It was just kind of a slog. It didn’t know what it wanted to be. It had elements of farce but wasn’t a farce. It had elements of deep character exploration but, ultimately, that was shallow.

The movie was okay. Even though Kelly Marie Tran was in Star wars and Bowen Yang is up and coming, I don't think they bring too much audience.

I think Crazy Rich Asians started to pave the way for a lot of Asian projects to be made, (Interior Chinatown for example), even the success of Everything Everywhere all at once was pretty piviotal.

Korean identity was clear and well done, but Chinese culture was thrown in without context, dragon dance and all, but never named.

The queer Asian women were all cast with the same look, same eye shape, no jawlines, no variety, just the same tired stereotype over and over. It’s disappointing, since real queer Asian women have a ton of range and beauty to them. Instead it’s visually bland, and the acting didn’t give them any depth or dynamic either. Felt like props, not people. I was thinking of my lesbian Asian friend, and my friend would be disappointed in this stereotypical representation. 

Not to be superficial, but compare the cast of the OG movie compared to this movie. There’s much more fun and elegant representation of LBGTQ+ community in the OG one. The current one fell backwards IMO

Also really feel like Angela and Chris having drunken sex and her getting impregnated is dealt with really easily?

One evening I stuck Withnail on the dvd player … and it became our house film. We tried to keep up with the drinks a few times … which was impossible, even without the lighter fluid.

mm6kkx2,1juw2vi,reddit,Yes it's a classic. I rewatched recently and had forgotten how bittersweet it was alongside the great comedy. Also the recent 4k restoration is excellent,2025-04-09 09:09:49,1,dunc2001,movies
mm5uruh,1juw2vi,reddit,"I just saw this for the first time a few months ago and I'm so angry with myself for waiting this long. It's exactly my kind of thing, and I would've been devoted to it if I'd seen it when I was young. 

The overall vibes of the movie are very late 80s to me, even though it's set in the 60s and making a point about how Withnail himself embodies the 60s. Just thought that was interesting. Danny (Ralph Brown) was so entertaining. I think he was actually much smarter than the main characters, and that was very funny.

My criticism: if we think about the plot from Monty's perspective, it's a whole other story, but the movie doesn't invite us to feel what he's feeling. He's just a punchline, and I think that's to the movie's detriment. I feel it's fine to write a gay character who's lecherous, to be clear, but he could've been written with more empathy.

It is one flaw (in my opinion) in a very good movie, though. I really loved it overall, and I'm sure I'll revisit it soon.",2025-04-09 04:51:38,1,Ajibooks,movies

Do y’all have any idea how hard it is to break through as an artist (in any discipline)? It requires passion, perseverance, capability, reliability, it demands people skills far beyond what most desk or renos jobs ask. 

Actors, writers, artists of all stripes have to put in countless hours of unpaid labor (to say nothing of having to pay for networking events and classes) just to get a foot in the door. That’s emotional labor, too, which can cut deep. 

If they’re in a movie as more than backgrounders, like with maybe a line or two or a whole character — they’ve achieved and overcome more than most people ever will. 

Respect artists and creatives. While I’m on it, respect scientists and other intellectual pursuits. If all that shit were easy, everyone would do it. 

Source: I’ve tried many paths, am still striving, looking for the right fit. I’ve got a lot of varied skills and talents and I know a lot of people who are in every stage of this journey from top to bottom.  The tales are all very similar.) Yes this is somewhat apocryphal but can we give our professionals of all stripes some ding dang respect all the way down to the folks who give us our burgers and fries?

Clancy Brown was great, but casting a French-~~Canadian~~ American that barely spoke English as a Scotsman, and casting a Scotsman as a katana-weilding Egyptian Spaniard were reeeeaaaaly strange choices.

There's a bunch of plot holes as well, and some really strange writing decisions.

*Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves* does for D&D what *Galaxy Quest* does for Star Trek, imo. 

I personally think Adam Sandler's *Little Nicky* is hilarious, but sadly most people didn't. I also love *Last Action Hero,* and honestly most of Schwarzenegger's comedies: *Junior*, *Kindergarten Cop*, *Twins*.

You might also like more of Steve Martin's comedies, like *Three Amigos*, although *Roxanne* and *L.A. Story* do have a heavy romance element.

The funniest animated movie I've seen and not on your list is probably *The Emperor's New Groove.*

mmkev7m,1jwlqr5,reddit,"I was thinking heavily about this during A Working Man.  I need to do some more research and watch some more movies (I'm a little over halfway through his filmography) but since he very rarely dies in film, his characters have roughly the same skill set and personality, and it's reasonable for most of his characters to have a false identity, I think it's possible to combine the majority of his roles into a single character and universe.  The universe would start off chronologically in his criminal days (so you could get his Guy Ritchie roles in there, plus some Transporter and his other smaller parts), then eventually he'd have a change of heart somewhere around Crank and try to go straight.  He gets into military and spy work in the U.K. and the U.S. (most of this wouldn't be directly covered by movies) and then most of his movies you could roughly organize into a timeline where he ends each one by dropping his love interest between movies, James Bond-style, gets a new identity, and starts over again somewhere else.  He keeps trying to leave his life behind but keeps getting dragged back in, whether it's new Expendable missions or just through circumstances beyond his control.  I'm planning to finish his filmography at some point to make a more coherent timeline out of it but I think you do this with most of his roles.  You'd have to cut some that are clearly in a different setting (animated/sci-fi/fantasy) and I feel like Deckard Shaw from Fast and Furious, while close to the Statham archetype, is too explicitly evil at first to really gel with the character (Prime Statham may be criminally inclined but he usually has morals and isn't a mass murderer), but most of them work just fine if you handwaved his backstory as a cover.

- asks his mate the time, then goes up to Linda, glances at the sun and tells her the exact time. ""Old bushman's trick!""

mkmtz2k,1jnra2g,reddit,"**City Slickers** (1991)

Not a movie that most of never heard of, it was a huge success at the time, but for some reason a comedy that kinda became forgotten.   At least in terms of other comedies of the 90s, City Slickers isn’t in that club of films that has stood the test of time in terms of popularity and known cross-generation.  I don’t think many under younger than their mid-30s might even be aware of this film’s existence, and I’d be willing to bet that those who remember the film have revisited it in years if not decades. 

But it’s a genuinely great comedy.  The main trio of Billy Crystal, Daniel Stern, Bruno Kirby have excellent comedic chemistry.  Jack Palance won a fucking Oscar for his supporting role in the film.  The comedic moments are fantastic, and there is some amazingly written heartfelt moments (Kirby’s character talking about his worst and best memory of his father)

It’s a shame that this film isn’t talked about much in retrospect.  It’s pretty great.  I’d suggest it to anyone who hasn’t seen it to watch it, and if it’s been years since you’ve seen it… do yourself a favor and revisit it.

mmt5nxc,1jxq7al,reddit,"I misread the title as The Wind Also Rises and was so confused for a moment, it should be considered in this lineup though.  I've seen Grave of the Fireflies and Threads in full, but sadly I've had to rely on summaries and clips of When the Wind Blows.  The first two haunt me because I place myself in their positions, it's sickening in a visceral way.


But When the Wind Blows definitely hits different, it's no less powerful however.  What hurts so much is seeing my loved ones in their position.  I feel less like it's something that could happen to me, and more that it's something I have to keep from happening for the sake of others.  There's a persistent tenderness to it that pierces the soul, yet hooks me in.


It feels ghoulish to phrase it this way, but it's my ""favorite"" of these films, even though I haven't seen it properly.  It's an insanely hard thing to balance in portraying such a terrible topic that is meant to traumatize you, while immersing you in to the story on a personal level.  Grave of the Fireflies is poetic, Threads is a cinematic air raid siren, but When the Wind Blows feels human in the most raw way.",2025-04-12 22:59:12,2,Slick_36,movies

Absolutely life changing.

From the moment the opening scene lit up the screen, I knew The Minecraft Movie was going to be something truly special. As a longtime fan of the game, I went in with high hopes—but what I experienced was beyond anything I could have imagined. This film isn’t just a video game adaptation; it’s a love letter to the creativity, adventure, and endless possibilities that Minecraft represents.

The whole first sequence with the movie shot outside on the hill was awesome, as well as the first talkie sequence with Margot Robbie. The Tobey Maguire part was great hilarious too.

I liked the intro sequence at the party but I do think some of the humor didn't really land, like the elephant shit and brad Pitt falling off the balcony was a little over the top.

As a whole film it could have been better, some of the parts dragged on a little bit for me but still a solid 7/8 out of 10 for me. I even liked the ending montage.

mlxy3hv,1jtxz8d,reddit,"The thing about Babylon is that the whole thesis it's giving us is that the dream factory that is Hollywood exists side-by-side with the problematic people and general abuse caused by the industry. They can't be separated, they feed into each other. So for Babylon to successfully do what it wants to do it purposely pushes up against the viewer. There are multiple piss and shit scenes in the first half an hour as well as incredible performances by Pitt and Robbie and some really incredibly well crafted scenes. 

There is a lot to have fun with and a lot to be abhorred by. Mix that with a target demographic that is older (appreciates the golden age of film) and it's really no wonder it bombed. But the movie in itself is a representation of what this movie loves about the industry, that despite all of the greed and abuse of the industry someone is still willing to give you 100 million dollars to make an audience feel great and terrible.

mlb28nb,1jr0qog,reddit,"Catch me folding instantly for Chel. I mean, god damn. 

I had never seen The Road to El Dorado so I gave it a watch this week and I have to say, I’m not sure if this is going to be one of those movies that’s looked at with heavy nostalgia but this seemed like it didn’t age very well. Elton John doing the soundtrack to a new world adventure musical sounds like a hit, but Dreamworks seems to be in a crisis of identity here, copying Disney every chance they get except when they're getting weirdly adult. This movie, momentarily entertaining as it can be, feels like it never knows what it wants to be. 

The movie is called The Road to El Dorado, and yet they spend very little of the movie searching for El Dorado or getting there. Circumstance lands them on the shore of the island, then there’s a silly exploration montage to an Elton John song and they’re there, in El Dorado where the rest of the movie takes place. Not to mention it touts itself as a musical, but seemingly only has one song that’s actually sung by the characters. It has several musical breaks, but only one that is sung on screen feels strange. 

Overall, I didn’t have a terrible time with this but there just wasn’t much to latch onto. A bit of a predictable story, even if almost depicting human sacrifices in a kid’s animated musical is a wild choice. And the humor is mostly Kevin Kline doing his thing and maybe we just don’t have to talk about how he’s voicing a Spaniard, but even that stuff feels very borrowed from other movies like it at the time. It was a 5/10 for me, really no strong feelings either way.

>The film's ending was changed shortly before its theatrical release. Originally, >!Burrows's character!< would escape the shark infested water and live. However, the test audience, who saw the film less than a month before its release, were angered by the ending because >!she was responsible for the shark experiments!< and was seen as the film's villain aside from the sharks themselves.

First of all: of course, how dare she attempt to >!cure Alzheimer's disease!<. Clearly she should have known better. /s

Second: after the amount of time we've spent invested in that character's perspective, the ending makes the rest of the movie feel disjointed and pointless in retrospect.

Loved the early work from Boden and Fleck and this is a nice return to that scale. So much heart in this.

I get why it’s not gonna be a knockout with critics - visually it’s not as strong as it could be, and the conceit of converging storylines doesn’t quite come together - there’s no real arc to the rap battle chapter. 

But man did I love this. The highs are really high and the second half is the strongest, so it sends you out soaring and vibing. It’s a neat mix of being ambitious but not self-important. 

It kinda reminded me of some of the criticism of White Lotus S3, in that you’re relying on the casting to carry the emotion rather than the writing. I don’t really disagree - but great performances are my favorite thing to watch on film! So this is dope. The cameo as fantastic. ",2025-04-11 04:56:07,10,ShadyCrow,movies

mlb4f4e,1jr0qs7,reddit,"This is such a classic heartbreak film. Really, I struggle to think of movies that are as introspective and all encompassing about breakup feelings. The format of HIgh Fidelity allows for so much reflection and self awareness around these topics. Seemingly heavily inspired by Annie Hall, Cusack really impresses in this as the first hour of it is almost a one man show where he monologues about his complex feelings. 


Seeing Cusack go through his middle-school-to-recent relationships in order is just a banger idea to get through all these feelings, but this movie really opens up in the second half when he starts calling all his old flames and asking what happened. It’s so real, how we put these former relationships on a pedestal and always forgetting why they didn’t work out, then you spend five minutes with the person and you immediately remember. I was especially taken by the high school relationship, when they get lunch and she has to remind him that he left her because she wouldn’t get physical. And not just that reminder, but the very real moment where she reveals that she slept with the first person who she was too tired to fight off after crying over Cusack for weeks. There’s some really poignant stuff there about perspective, about how our selfish actions affect other people while we walk away and don’t think about it for ten years. Really amazing scene. 

And if this movie wasn’t good enough, what it does at the end is so subversive for the time. After getting back together with the girl that started this whole plot, Iben Hjejle,he meets a seemingly more perfect woman. She’s a music journalist, she loves his obscure work, and she shows an interest in him. And most movies might take this chance to give him a happy ending and show the existential crisis depicted in this as unnecessary when he ultimately decides to leave Iben. But the movie doesn’t do that. The ultimate lesson of this movie is that there will always be seemingly greener grasses, that moving to person to person is just a series of realizing people aren’t the fantasies you build up in your mind. 

The ending to this movie is so good because Iben isn’t the perfect person he’s been looking for, but she’s the one who’s still there. Who survived a rocky relationship with him and is still by his side. And maybe the most adult thing you can do is stop chasing and start focusing on what you have. It’s actually incredibly powerful, and bonus points for Jack Black getting his plot wrapped up in such a fantastic way by seeing him completely own that stage and those vocals. This is a movie about how a familiar job with your friends can seem like adult purgatory, and watching all those record snobs find happiness in their way is so satisfying. 9/10.

He asks the audience to think of the five worst things they've ever done in a relationship with no sugar coating.  It was a very human moment.

I watched it again about a year ago, as a married 36 year old, and, man, did I get a rude awakening. It hits so much different as an adult in a relationship. Like, Rob, in dealing with his own problems, doesn't see that he is the cause of most of them. He continually put the blame on everybody else because THEY were the problem.

The whole picture was clearly zoomed in to fit the Imax aspect ratio and as a result was missing a decent portion of the original artwork. It was a pretty big bummer for me.

mk4v9zl,1jlkdp3,reddit,"I liked it, but I kinda felt like the stinger was a bit too obvious. Like in this kind of movie, I guess I just inherently expect some sort of last second twist to make it dark, and I was initially pleasantly surprised that it reached the credits without being a downer...only for it to do it anyway after the initial credits. I guess I'll pretend the last shot doesn't happen.

Two extra thoughts, I genuinely thought the movie was going to end with her just dying on the operating table from the surgery machine for a moment.

mkh7f3r,1jlkdp3,reddit,"Basically The Thing, if terrible. I really didn't enjoy this movie but I'm most shocked at the people saying it had good direction? That was absolutely the worst part of it! The way the jump scares just constantly interrupted the movie in the first half via her hallucinations was endlessly annoying- I found it very irritating that they didn't feel like diegetic parts of the movie and were purely there to provide ""hey I surprised you right"" moments. Wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't the one trick the director had up his sleeve and I'm pretty sure he did it at least 5 times. Some cool trippy visuals for like 5 minutes cannot save a movie this poorly directed/edited the rest of the runtime.

The plot was nothing special but I didn't expect it to be. The acting was fine for me but the characters are completely flat and uninteresting- these things wouldn't be a big deal if the concept carried it, but the movie spends a strange amount of time in characters' heads and gives lines like ""you can't let things go"" even though it makes almost no attempt for me to know these people.

Movie also really didn't know when to end- I think it should've just cut to black after the spiel from the main villain. Random note I can't think of where else to put- I did get one good laugh out of the ""Sorry for your loss"" screen, but that's the one bit of dark humor I could find in this movie so it feels strangely dissonant.

Finally, I usually don't care strongly about this sort of thing, but because of how unenjoyable the rest of the movie was it couldn't help but bother me how the creature's abilities basically varied depending on whatever the writer needed the creature to do in that moment. One second it turns people into rage monsters, next it makes them able to imitate the person enough to trick others, next it only stays in your brain and subtly influences you, and if it feels like it I guess it can explode your head and turn you into one of the things from Parasyte. Also even though it can explode out of glass by itself quite easily it can't put any sort of fight up against a surgical robot (or at least, just immediately drill its way back in afterwards given that it's clearly really easy for it to do so).

I should note that I am completely unfamiliar with Flying Lotus- I went into this movie because I wanted to give a shot to some random lesser known movie and the premise sounded decent. But knowing afterwards that the guy is mainly a musician makes so much sense because that's what a lot of this felt like- a music video. So much of the music was used completely inappropriately, often came and went in random short bursts, completely overpowered everything else and did not punctuate the actual movie's plot, characters or visual flair whatsoever.

Just awful, awful. Not like an all-time worst movie or anything but certainly the worst I've seen this year so far.

Felt lile this shouldve been a bit more horrific in that the many finding out about humans, realize they found a perfect slave race to help with their other planetary investments.

When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me.

I was interested in the plot, having all the scenes go back and forth was cool, slowly revealing bits of the story, this is mainly done through the environment, which was cool.

Maybe Riya's breakdowns could've emotionally hit a little more, but given what Brion was offering her motivationally I appreciate the subdued acting. I actually liked Riya and Brion's interactions, as well as how the movie explores the planet from the isolated station, but I remember being a little confused about which parts were hallucinations and how they fit in the timeline.

mmp78vj,1jlkdma,reddit,"I’ve been sitting with my thoughts on this film and have continued to develop them since the moment I walked out of the theater weeks ago, I have nowhere or no one with whom to share them with so here seems like a slightly better option than the void. 

This film to me, speaks on a great deal more than what many are giving it credit for. I’ve seen it being misidentified and minimized as trauma porn, where the audience is being needlessly exposed to a man’s suffering without point behind it. I could not disagree more with this. Let me go ahead and get the most polarizing opinion I have about this film out of the way : It both more effectively displays and illustrates the male loneliness epidemic, and the effects/consequences of it when combined with traditional masculine ideals pushed to extremes, than Taxi Driver does. Yes, I fully recognize the influence that taxi driver has on this movie and many others, and without it as a blueprint this film would effectively cease to be. With that being said, I feel like the characterization seen here is a step above, and there is no better time for a film like this to release from a cultural and social standpoint. 

Despite the character of Killian Maddox suffering from an array of potentially innate mental disorders that worsen his positioning and interactions with the world around him, the ultimately exacerbating factors are ones that are all too common. The isolationism that Killian faces due to his more niche area of interest, lack of support or extended family, and limited time and resources to expand his circle outside of his workplace and gym, is incredibly damaging. 

His lofty idealistic goals, that require achieving impossible heights of grandeur and esteem in order to feel fulfilled, are so often parroted in old school traditional homes not dissimilar from the one his grandfather raised him in. The idea that in order to be worthy as a man in this world, you can’t simply exist, but must be GREAT. That sort of drive to escape mediocrity as a means of self actualization is what both keeps Killian alive but is also what destroys him from the inside. It’s another separating factor from him and the rest of society, those who are content with normalcy and prioritize personal relationships, things that he hasn’t been raised to understand. Many of the effects that we see on screen as a result of these factors, are ones that affect men that YOU, the person reading this, currently know, some to a lesser degree depicted, but others comparable in damage. 

As frightening as it is, many men can see parts of themselves in Killian. Now more than ever in a social media age, where young men are being exposed to all manner of content that allows them to disassociate from real world interactions, and dampens their social skills and ability to connect with those around them. Now more than ever where podcasts that perpetuate gender wars are commonly spread, and push misogyny over acceptance, superficiality over genuineness, and monetary gain over meaningful relationships. Killian Maddox is, just as Travis Bickle was, a warning to young men. A cautionary tale begging to be heard, where we see the absolute deconstruction of a man who like all of us so desperately wants to be accomplished, to be seen, to be loved, but with every attempt to do so pushes himself further from all of what he could want because his methodology stems from his detachment to reality. 

Whenever he’s not obsessively chasing towards his goal, he drowns himself in pornography and YouTube. Distraction methods that are easier for him to do than to connect with other people in any meaningful way. Easier to do than to be honest with his therapist, and confront the traumas, stresses, and pain that lead to his feelings of discontent and anguish. He robs himself of a proper outlet for his feelings, all to maintain the image that he is strong and unaffected, as he believes a man should be. As a result all of these bottled feelings explode into violence, poor decisions, strong impulsive feelings, even going as far as to consider murder and suicide. At times this movie felt as if it was a biopic for a future mass shooter, and more effectively breaks down the events that would lead to it better than any movie in that genre that I can think of. 

This film SHOULD be uncomfortable. It places a magnifying glass on the ugliest aspects of social pressure, home taught values, and trauma that are shaping many of our young men today. Shaping them to be confused, to be angry, to be lost. This is one of the most under appreciated and under discussed film in the last decade, and I think it’s a real travesty that it is not being seen on the scale that it should be, by the generation that truly needs to see it most.

mnp4v71,1k1tss4,reddit,"Someone in the thread mentioned the film feels ""unfocused"" and that is indeed the chief complaint I have with it.

It's meant to be a satire but we don't really get the satirical satisfaction. It's like Wolf of Wall Street tier bad, where people worship the character instead of realizing they're one of the rubes in the audience at the end listening to Belfort's talk about selling pens.

Also, without thorough research, it's not clear to most viewers what exactly he is confessing in the final scene. At least half of the viewers think it means that he didn't do various things in the film and are adamant about it. It's reportedly one of the director's regrets about the film - that people thought it was unclear or even ambiguous whether he did murder people and get away with it. When the end is meant to be a revelation that he did do those things and will face absolutely no consequences because that part of American society is so vapid, disingenuous, and morally bankrupt.

It sort of gives Bale's character an out when part of the audience thinks he may not have done anything. And nothing prompts the audience to realize that Bateman is a character that is not well-liked: they can't distinguish him from other bankers, he has a job at the firm due to nepotism where he does nothing, he has absurdly petty jealousy, his girlfriend/fiancee doesn't really like him, and he works himself up into a murderous frenzy because he has nothing actually going on in his life. ""There is no catharsis"" - he is literally just a ball of unchecked vapid consumerist self-interest (to an absurdist degree with the violence he engages in).

It's sort of the opposite of Fight Club's Durden giving anti-consumerist speeches (and orders...) - here we are meant to goggle at the absurdity of Bateman's consumerism and vanity. But I think it's such an ingrained part of American culture that a lot of folks simply enjoy the absurdity of it and even aspire to it. The skincare, the suits, the watches, the fancy dinners, the fancy apartment... that's a lot of American's ""goals."" We needed something to focus the message.",2025-04-18 02:45:47,-5,BoredGuy2007,movies

mlb6itq,1jr0qki,reddit,"The score was really giving me John Carpenter vibes.

The movie itself was decent. The story was pretty by the numbers. I thought the killers reveal was kinda underwhelming and their motive was super lame.

There’s no theme about fame, or desensitization of violence due to the media, or anything related to their motive. It just didn’t feel thought out to me. The script didn’t seem to have a theme in mind.

That being said, I had fun with this movie. The characters were fun to watch and I got a few chuckles. Honestly it seems like they just wanted to make a fun horror movie, and that’s what they did.

A couple nitpicks: I’m surprised none of the characters acknowledged the Oija board was wrong about Ezra being dead. And what was the blood on the mirror during Demi’s “death” scene? Fake blood I guess…?",2025-04-04 02:31:10,67,Kcomix,movies

mlidad6,1jr0qki,reddit,"I loved it. The cutaways will probably annoy some people since it's built around the slasher concept. I'm not big on slashers, so I really enjoyed the emphasis on comedy.

I went primarily because this is the first time I know of that a Gen Z-oriented movie was actually directed/written by Gen Z, and I just wanted to see a Gen Z movie that understood who it was depicting. It was a very sincere, funny movie. All of the actors were more or less playing their actual ages, and all of the dialogue and interactions felt realistic to how people actually talk. The humor landed so well. A few sequences made me laugh out loud. I also really liked Finn/Billy/Fred's characters respective arcs.

I don't have many other slashers to compare it to, but the whole movie felt like it was trying to be more grounded vs trying for outlandish kills/events. I especially appreciated the choreography in the final fight scene. I'm guessing it won't do well in theaters because most people watching will want something more straight-forward slasher and it's really much more of a coming-of-age comedy set during a slasher scenario.

Bodega CA. Nowhere near the town of Bodega Bay much less up the street from The Tides like it's made to look like in the movie.

Even in 1991 none of us were able to figure out the logistics of the school yard where the crows are on the jungle gym between the school and Annie's house. There were/are full grown, slow growing, full grown redwoods right next to the school house. Right where Melanie would have been sitting on the bench. You can see them still on Google Maps. And I mean more than 30 years old large trees back in 1991. Looks like it's fenced now too which it wasn't in 2006. Use to be able to walk up onto the porch of the school to take pictures. And Annie's house was either just a built facade on an open lot there. That's what the Brenner house was. Just a fake house on open land torn down after the movie was shot. Or Annie's was a real house that was torn down and a new one rebuilt because the one there now looks nothing like her's.

I'm just going to guess that they were able to use just camera trickery and compositing to make it look like they were next to each other. Because it's those trees. Redwoods and pines. Those could not have grown to that size in less than 30 years between when it was filmed and I first saw the place. And they're about the same size now.

It's about a prisoner aboard a penitentiary starship who is sent on a solo mission to check out an uninhabited planet.

When he gets there, he finds that it's actually got a vast civilization, one which mirrors his own --but which is even more dystopian, violent, authoritarian, and bureaucratic.

He's hailed as a Hero...only to discover what horrible fate awaits heroes in this world.

Jordan Peele's ""Get Out"" and ""Us"" are nice Psy Thrillers, beyond the social critique. I would also recommend ""Mystic River"", ""The Stranger"" and ""No. 10 Cloverfield Lane"".

Lastly, and this might be getting away from the genre, but ""You were never really here"" is a great and underestimated drama/suspense/action film IMO, worth checking it out.

After breathing air on this planet for over 77 years, I’ve seen more than my share of tragedy in both real life and movies and TV shows. Seeing tragedies in movies only reopens the festering wounds I have accumulated from memories of real tragedies. I identify with people in movies and begin to care about them and want them to stay safe and healthy. When I see a movie where a great tragedy is averted, and people are saved, am over, overwhelmed by a wonderful feeling that I can only compare with feeling the love of God. When you feel that good and care about people that much you’re looking for someone to share that with. I’m still looking and hoping that social media may do that for me. Anyway thanks again. I respect and appreciate views of other people, but I am overwhelmed and feeling so wonderful about my view, I only want to share it so others can feel as I do.",2025-04-22 14:40:28,1,Low_Building1098,movies

mom89k7,1k5wqcd,reddit,"I had someone once ask me why I kept books after I’ve read them. I had to take a minute to be sure it was a serious question.

I’ve watched plenty of films more than 100 times. I’ve read books more than 100 times too. Some books I’ve had to replace because they fell apart.

But I will put it in more context, because what I understand now is that people’s brains work in different ways, they process visual and verbal information differently, and store memories differently too. Some people don’t like to wear the same outfit twice, or have the same food twice in one week. Others get the same item of clothing in different colours, or even the same colour (me) so they can wear it all the time. 

I get it. Some people are neurotypical, and that’s ok. They can be happy that way, even if they never have a single hyperfocus their whole lives. Sometimes people will say “hundreds of times” and not mean it literally, or not be bothered that someone else says it when it’s simply not possible, and don’t need you to point it out. Both ways are fine.",2025-04-23 14:50:32,1,the_esjay,movies

The fallout from this was big. I mean Costner got knocked down for awhile. It all but killed Dennis Hopper's big movie career. Hopper had an awesome run of iconic roles and a comeback that led to his 90s era which were all classics. He's still the best part of those movies he's in, but Super Mario didn't do him any favors, and any good will he mustered back with Speed which is iconic, was crushed in this movie - WHICH he still killed it in.

Living alone in a post-apocalyptic dystopian society, a family of brothers forced to live on their own while trying to survive the elements as well as the vicious, ravenous creatures they have chained up inside the basement which would threaten their existence if it were to be revealed.

The ethics vs morals theme is a joke. It’s not meant to be a serious philosophical musing. McAllister ignoring his friend’s blatantly wrong act while at the same time lecturing pretentiously on the difference between ethics and morals is satire. Novotny’s actions are absolutely grooming and statutory rape. It’s an adult teacher preying on their student. It’s not ambiguous. McAllister arguing for ambiguity makes him a villain. He must do these mental gymnastics to convince himself he’s righteous. That’s the joke.

Such a slick, relentlessly paced action horror film that holds up incredibly well two decades later.

Sarah Polley absolutely carried this film with some great supporting performances from Ving Rhames and the dude who played the lead security guard, CJ.

They pack so much into that one day, which admittedly is part of the charm, but they could stretch that out over several days, weeks, months or years of the in-world time.

Really build out the backstories for all the cast. 

Show us Corey’s home life, the proud but pushy parents, her growing drug use to keep up with academic life.

Show us AJ pining for Corey, working on his art.

Warrens home life, leading him to juvenile delinquency. 

Joe learning of the Music Town buyout and trying to work in the background to make the deal to buy the store.

Debra and Berko, their relationship, what brings Debra to the point where we meet her in the film.

And so on and so forth.

The whole season leading up to the big “Damn The Man, Save The Empire” gig.

But then again, you couldn't possibly fit everything into one movie anyway.

I would love to craft a tv series adaptation of the book, and the great thing about it is that after you put all the canon stuff into the first few seasons, you can go wild with all the stories which never got expanded upon. Like, what DID Engywook become famous for? How exactly did Hero Hynrick kill Smerg? Who went back to find Grograman and uphold Bastian's promise? What sort of adventures did Pataplan and Cairon have?

They make you want to pay attention in a different way than other movies might.

And don't get me started on this all coming together for the part where she>! talks to the Chinese military leader in the flashforward.  !<

And the ominous tones of the spaceships.  The sounds the aliens make, the sound of the smoke dissipating in their pod, etc.

I suspect in part the sequence was cut because -and I hate to get so blunt here- it looked pretty awful.  It felt like Cameron pushed the already meager Aliens budget as far as he could and that sequence looked pretty dreadful compared to so many others in the movie.

mnucqfc,1k293mg,reddit,"They’re largely inconsequential, but there are two moments in *Titanic* that are callbacks to previous cut scenes. 

In the large first class dinner scene, Jack is asked how he takes his caviar by a waiter. He declines, saying he never did like caviar much, a line Rose smiles at. In a deleted part of their scene walking around the ship together before dinner, Rose has a moment where she decries the posh lifestyle being imposed on her, specifically stating that she hates caviar after Jack jokes about it. A steward then approaches them and offers her caviar, which she loudly bristles against. Jack then declines his own caviar offer at dinner, in a show of solidarity with Rose. 

In another deleted scene between the two out on deck, they sing “Come Josephine In My Flying Machine” together, which is the song Rose sings quietly to herself on the water after the ship sinks. 

Neither are particularly important, especially the song. However I’ve always thought the caviar line at dinner is out of place without the initial scene that sets it up.",2025-04-18 23:23:41,2,Mr_Kinton,movies

it's crazy that ive found so many commenters out here blatantly and shamelessly exposing their fear of diversity , jumping at any chance to attack the ""other side's agenda"" and carelessly display their deep rooted misogyny and racism ....

it's one thing to pick apart the movie for it's legitimate imperfections, thats perfectly fine... but people saying its ""purely a woke fantasy"", ""BLM propoganda"", or some type of ""liberal unrealistic garbage"" is evidence of people's inability to comprehend a world where someone's existence is not a political statement. Black women exist... they can be in positions of power... we are all used to white men in charge and that doesn't mean it should be normal. 

are people here so insecure and dense that they think casting a black female president is shoving leftist ideologies down their throat?

how many other action films / shows have completley unrealistic effects, stunts and battles that end with the protagonist ""winning"" against odds that make it so unlikley they would practically surive? 

we suspend our disbelief in action films ALL THE TIME... so calling it woke and unrealistic is just revealing your own selective tolerance.

The movie also quickly establishes that she is an anxious person by her very nature, so yeah, you're gonna have to manage her mental state during the crisis moments, which is what Ray eventually learns to do.

mm2d7u1,1juct3f,reddit,"A Goofy Movie is one of my all time favorites. Not just because it's just a solid heartfelt story with plenty of funny goofs, but because of its place in my life.

This doc does a great job at showing the small team that put it together, how much it meant to them, alludes to how painful it was when it released to commercial quietness, and gives some fun behind the scenes from filming.

This one isn't a Disney juggernaut of grand scale. It was an afterthought at the time as Disney focused on bigger things. This is all important to note because the film was made by people. Made by people who wanted the film to mean something and put their whole self into making it. This documentary does a great job at conveying that.

Finally, the last 15 or so minutes are dedicated to the people like me. People who watch it and yeah, they like the movie, but more importantly they relate to it, either as an empathetic person, a parent or a child. It's always reassuring to see that not only can you relate to the story being told on film, but also to other people through that relation to the film. This is anything and everything that I could hope to get from new content around A Goofy Movie. Please don't remake it.

It's also pretty funny that there's not a peep about the sequel, which I do enjoy, but obviously it doesn't have the pieces of the puzzle to really latch onto over time.",2025-04-08 17:14:25,18,UberCamm2,movies
mm2neh2,1juct3f,reddit,"*A Goofy Movie* was a childhood classic that I regularly watched whenever it aired on Disney Channel. Different from the romance-driven fairy tales the studio was producing at the time, *Goofy Movie* was refreshingly different, being a John Hughes-inspired road trip comedy with musical numbers thrown in for good measure. Released after the massive success of *The Lion King*, *A Goofy Movie* was released without fanfare and failed to impress critics. It did well on home video, I believe, and garnered an online fandom thanks to the emergence of YouTube. During the website's early years, fans reenacted the song ""After Today"" that became a viral hit. 

*Not Just a Goof* reflects the cult classic the film has become as this was an independently-produced documentary directed by Eric Kimelton (who is the nephew of *A Goofy Movie* director Kevin Lima) and Christopher Ninness. The documentary shares some delightful hand-drawn pencil animation, detailing what happened during production. There's also vintage footage of the production team and the voice cast recording their lines, highlighting the  creative challenges that shaped this beloved film. There's no juicy gossip of note, though thankfully, cooler heads prevailed when Jeffrey Katzenberg proposed having Goofy speak with a normal voice than his familiar cartoonish voice. 

There was a lot of heart put into the making of this documentary, though the direct-to-video sequel *An Extremely Goofy Movie* was unfortunately ignored. I liked that film growing up, too. Still, it was heartwarming to see the reevaluation *A Goofy Movie* has received and how prevalent the cult fandom has grown online.",2025-04-08 18:01:34,7,ChrisCinema,movies

mmgzpwu,1jvzqn3,reddit,"There's one shot in the movie Rocky that always makes me cry, and the more reaction videos I watch, the more obvious it is to me that it's strictly for dudes. No matter how they embrace their maleness, they all are still hardwired a certain way. And when you see Mickey walking sadly off down Rocky's street, thinking he'd just humiliated himself and then heard someone's true sadness, and was now just disappearing from the story forever. But Rocky has a heart, and won't just throw someone away and let them fade out like that in tragic hopelessness. He suddenly appears in his doorway, and jogs down the street to catch up with him. And that's what saves everything. It feels to me like the climactic moment in Everything, Everywhere, All At Once when Joy is standing at her car ready to leave and not see her mom again as anything other than a distant relative... and then it all turns around because of selfless love, and it's a moment with importance that could span a universe.",2025-04-10 22:54:13,2,IanRastall,movies

mou035n,1k6y788,reddit,"Maine - Pet Sematary (1989)

1. Because of the Stephen King connection. Maine doesn't have many homegrown big name celebrities, so a lot of Mainers take pride in him growing up and continuing to live in the area.

2. There also aren't a ton of movies primarily filmed in Maine. This is one of them, and it being a King adaptation (with a cameo by the author himself) as well makes it extra special.

3. Literally every town in Maine has a Jud Crandall. Go to any hometown store at 6AM and you'll find a Jud type pounding coffee and shooting the shit with the clerk.

4. Maine is weird, so the best representation being Pet Sematary makes sense.

Honorably mention: Bluebird (2013)

Set and filmed in Northern Maine, involving a logging community dealing with a tragedy/mistake. Captures small town vibes well, and the isolation and frigidness of Northen Maine.",2025-04-24 18:24:55,2,Special-Fix-3320,movies

I really enjoyed this movie, although it was tough to watch at times. As someone with an addict in her family, Sandra Bullock's character really hit home. Her immaturity, the jokey was she downplays her actions, the self-deprecation, the sister who went through the same trauma and managed to turn out stable. It all was extremely relatable for me, unfortunately. One of the toughest bits is when the sister confronts her about the things Sandra Bullock's character said at her wedding, which Bullock's character doesn't even remember because she was so wasted. I'm sure many of us with addicts in our families are familiar with waiting for apologies that will never come because the addict doesn't remember half the offensive shit they've said or done to hurt you. 

The fake soap opera and the always delightful Alan Tudyk lightened things up quite a bit. The side romance with Viggo Mortensen is an interesting enough fun little distraction.

The panic and fear when they are going through Gibraltar,  because you have been with the characters for so long, you care deeply.

When this teaser trailer for *The Master* came out in 2012, it was the most excited I've ever been for an upcoming movie. It laid just enough groundwork for me to guess the tone of the film and yet have no idea what the overall story was about. It did not even include the majority of its cast, just Joaquin in some early moments from the film.

The trailer was successful. I anticipated the movie so much, that when I eventually saw it, it was a mystery revealed, and I was still mystified by it, but thoroughly entranced. Since I have watched it over ten times in the thirteen years since, and my appreciation increases with every viewing. It is my favorite film, and I watch and love an insane number of movies.

…ended up being one of the worst movies I’ve ever seen.  So many pointless scenes that didn’t develop the story at all, horribly paced and felt rushed, and a cheesy soundtrack that hilariously tried too hard to add to any suspense. Like in a bad, cheap Redbox movie kind of way.

mm1ps01,1jud61p,reddit,"I agree somewhat with the assessment here and I feel a lot of this could have been remedied with significantly better editing which IMO Is the WEAKEST part of this film. The pacing makes absolutely no sense and we're jumping through in some cases multiple years between scenes and trying to catch up with wtf is going on that the tone of taking it seriously is hard to process, ie this movie should've 100% been a campy dark comedy because the more serious stuff has absolutely no time to be fleshed out 

For example, in the film Gucci in the 90s is portrayed as being this gawdy/lower tier fashion house and they wanna turn it around as they're just falling apart. Well shit, no one wants to design for them; but wait hold on there's this guy from Texas that we can bring in since none of the European designers want to do it? Cue Tom Ford and arguably one of the funnier introductions (is he a mechanic?) and then in the case of about 10 minutes Tom Ford shows up, makes the iconic fashion show, now serious scene ensues, Tom Ford leaves the room and is never seen from again.

Idk how they managed to Mary Sue Tom Ford in this case but the breakneck pace of this Texan coming in and literally saving the house of Gucci then just disappears right after sort of encapsulates the movie as a whole: very little actual character development and instead there's just a series of scenes where there's not enough time to flesh things out and not much organized progression which is insane considering how LONG this movie is.",2025-04-08 15:19:07,5,MrT-1000,movies

I figured filming it from the beat cop pov (him and his partner for instance) would make it so much more dramatic. Something kind of End of watch-like.

mm1348u,1juccjk,reddit,"I present two pretty unfaithful adaptations of two notorious X-Men storylines.

[Firstly, the definitive modern Professor X story: Deadly Genesis.](https://old.reddit.com/user/FrameworkisDigimon/comments/zumoj3/vulcan_is_the_ideal_character_for_a_blip_era_movie/j1mqap3/) I guess the 30 second pitch would be:

>During the Blip, three mutants try to convince their rage fuelled former teammate to help them try and save the universe, but Vulcan is too obsessed by the mysteries and traumas of his past to help anyone. So they agree to help him find his answers.

If you're familiar with Deadly Genesis, even that 30 second pitch removes most of the Professor X stuff from it. If you're not familiar with Deadly Genesis, what people don't like about it is what it did to Xavier's character.

Not interested? I won't give up yet, three words: supervillain origin story.

[Secondly, the notorious The Draco](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudiosxmen/comments/tkkue9/how_would_you_implement_nightcrawler/i1r2mdg/) Again quick pitch:

>Prompted by the rampaging legacy virus, Kurt seeks out Mystique to find out if she's his mother, only for both of them to be abducted by his grandfather Azazel and brought to his tall ship sailing the oceans of the demon-plagued Brimstone Dimension. Turns out, Azazel wants Kurt's help to convince Mystique to abandon her scheme to resurrect Destiny.

Personally almost all the things people hate about the Draco weren't actually in the Draco. By making Azazel Kurt's grandfather (Mystique's father) I have hopefully eliminated those facets even more (in The Draco, Azazel is Kurt's father). I also use this story to foreshadow Amenth (which was kinds sorta retrospectively turned into the mutant myth arc by HoX/PoX, one of the most beloved X-Men stories of all time).

Still not convinced? Three words: Nightcrawler the pirate!

If that doesn't make any sense to you, you're not a Nightcrawler fan. Sorry to tell you that. Just look at the results you get from searching ""[nightcrawler pirate](https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&client=firefox-b-d&sca_esv=6292aac01ea52d81&sxsrf=AHTn8zogKic9zEvxC6JA0vyeR2ACicv8xQ:1744118288726&q=nightcrawler+pirate&udm=2&fbs=ABzOT_CWdhQLP1FcmU5B0fn3xuWpA-dk4wpBWOGsoR7DG5zJBsxayPSIAqObp_AgjkUGqel3rTRMIJGV_ECIUB00muput9Zp8VMKUi0ZjqPs3JlrgNjQ9rOqRdXcDwEBQ82jIzIeJKF_t4xlLNL8OlcUPXuD4mOHi5CwSvqoRYVHDp8kIKIKk9txe0fwpxc-El6CFYl-jFdhssameWHw9C9RusrnI0QBZA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjFu674wsiMAxWisFYBHQ81KLYQtKgLegQIGRAB&biw=1536&bih=739&dpr=1.25)"".

Make something unique that does not rely on a previous intellectual property, please.

The last genuinely unique thing I recall seeing was Inception.  Dreams within dreams within dreams?  A heist team within a dream?

The concept wasn't brand spanking new but it also hadn't been done to death already.  

Look at the hot posts today on this subreddit.  How many of them are about new releases for things that have been done to death already, or rely on prior intellectual property?

Minecraft, Mission Impossible, Predator, Angry Birds, Thunderbolts (just another superhero movie), Godzilla vs Kong.  This past weekend had new releases for Snow White and Captain America, as well as yet another ""generic Jason Statham movie"".

If you include recent weeks, you've also got a Naked Gun reboot, Five Nights at Freddy's 2, How to Train Your Dragon 2, John Wick 5.

Anticipated this summer are movies that include:  Another Jurassic Park, a movie set in the John Wick universe, 28 Years Later, another Superman, Lilo & Stitch, and a reboot of Freaky Friday.

I just want some unique, refreshing stories and concepts.  Is that too much to ask for?

While not a movie, Severance is a good example.  The concept may not be entirely novel, but can you think of a similar movie/show in 10 seconds?  

Deep sigh.  I've seen plenty of blockbusters.  I guess I'm at the point where I want to be engaged, invested, not just ""blown away"" or ""happy through fanservice"".

mn7sz9q,1jqaxbc,reddit,"I am very surprised to see this movie posted about so recently. Some thoughts:

1. I really liked the movie when it came out but today, 80 years almost after the end of ww2 with anyone involved  pushing 100, it must seem dated to many. It came out half a century ago when Mengele was actually still alive whereas today he would be 120 or something. Peck plays him well -- as a terrible man as Mengele certainly was.

2. I think people will enjoy the book (with the same ""dated"" warning). A slight spoiler: >!I feel the movie made a strange choice vs the book: The nazi hunter and Mengele meet in the living room of the ""father"" of the Hitler clone whom Mengele has shot. The nazi hunter asks if the man is still alive and in the book, Mengele says something like, ""Sure, he's in the kitchen making us sandwiches."" The movie has Mengele say ""He's making us cocktails."" -- I think ""sandwiches"" is much funnier.!<",2025-04-15 11:32:52,2,relesabe,movies

I've known of it for decades, but never really watched it until last week. I expected it to be another clone of Friday the 13th and Halloween and while it does definitely use the same blueprint as Halloween in particular, I was genuinely surprised and pleased to discover that its focus is not on gory kills but suspense terror.


 In fact, the film doesn't even hide the killer - he's a man who was jilted by his lover who murders her on her wedding day, right before the actual wedding . Then he escapes unseen and proceeds to find and target other brides to be preparing for their nuptials.




 There's an unexpected degree of attention to character in the film and while it isn't particularly bloody, it is violent and it's frequently deeply unsettling. I was impressed with the film more than I had anticipated. It's definitely one of the better slashers of the 1978- 1984 era .




Side note, it features a very young Tom Hanks in a minor supporting role as a psyche major one of the women is dating. Apparently, this was his first appearance in a major motion picture.",2025-04-23 15:09:01,2,Ancient_Barnacle4245,movies

I watched “Sudden Fear” recently and it is a very emotive performance. “Jane” captures the contrast perfectly. Crawford is doing almost as much as Davis but it is very reactive and doesn’t really define the character in the way Davis’ choices do. Davis can be bad but she plays characters and Crawford has a bag of tricks she brings to everything she plays. None of her characters can be distinguished from one another. When it’s good like Mildred Pierce it is fantastic but it is rarely different.

You’re supposed to love being a mother, but don’t talk about your kids all the damn time. You have to be a career woman, but also always be looking out for other people. You have to answer for men’s bad behavior, which is insane, but if you point that out, you’re accused of complaining. You’re supposed to stay pretty for men, but not so pretty that you tempt them too much or that you threaten other women because you’re supposed to be a part of the sisterhood. But always stand out and always be grateful. But never forget that the system is rigged. So find a way to acknowledge that but also always be grateful. You have to never get old, never be rude, never show off, never be selfish, never fall down, never fail, never show fear, never get out of line. It’s too hard!

I don't have to tell you things are bad. Everybody knows things are bad. It's a depression. Everybody's out of work or scared of losing their job. The dollar buys a nickel's worth; banks are going bust; shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter; punks are running wild in the street, and there's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do, and there's no end to it.

We know the air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat. And we sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had fifteen homicides and sixty-three violent crimes, as if that's the way it's supposed to be!

We all know things are bad -- worse than bad -- they're crazy.

It's like everything everywhere is going crazy, so we don't go out any more. We sit in the house, and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller, and all we say is, ""Please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms. Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radials, and I won't say anything. Just leave us alone.""

Well, I'm not going to leave you alone.

I want you to get mad!

I don't want you to protest. I don't want you to riot. I don't want you to write to your Congressman, because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write. I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street.

All I know is that first, you've got to get mad.

You've gotta say, ""I'm a human being, goddammit! My life has value!""

So, I want you to get up now. I want all of you to get up out of your chairs. I want you to get up right now and go to the window, open it, and stick your head out and yell,

moobeqq,1k671t2,reddit,"One of my favorite speeches of all time in a movie is from Spencer Tracy's character in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner in regard to his white daughter marrying a very successful black doctor. For 1967, this movie was groundbreaking. 

Matt Drayton: Now Mr. Prentice, clearly a most reasonable man, says he has no wish to offend me but wants to know if I'm some kind of a *nut*. And Mrs. Prentice says that like her husband I'm a burned-out old shell of a man who cannot even remember what it's like to love a woman the way her son loves my daughter. And strange as it seems, that's the first statement made to me all day with which I am prepared to take issue... cause I think you're wrong, you're as wrong as you can be. I admit that I hadn't considered it, hadn't even thought about it, but I know exactly how he feels about her and there is nothing, absolutely nothing that you son feels for my daughter that I didn't feel for Christina. Old- yes. Burned-out- certainly, but I can tell you the memories are still there- clear, intact, indestructible, and they'll be there if I live to be 110. Where John made his mistake I think was in attaching so much importance to what her mother and I might think... because in the final analysis it doesn't matter a damn what we think. The only thing that matters is what they feel, and how much they feel, for each other. And if it's half of what we felt- that's everything. As for you two and the problems you're going to have, they seem almost unimaginable, but you'll have no problem with me, and I think when Christina and I and your mother have some time to work on him you'll have no problem with your father, John. But you do know, I'm sure you know, what you're up against. There'll be 100 million people right here in this country who will be shocked and offended and appalled and the two of you will just have to ride that out, maybe every day for the rest of your lives. You could try to ignore those people, or you could feel sorry for them and for their prejudice and their bigotry and their blind hatred and stupid fears, but where necessary you'll just have to cling tight to each other and say ""screw all those people""! Anybody could make a case, a hell of a good case, against your getting married. The arguments are so obvious that nobody has to make them. But you're two wonderful people who happened to fall in love and happened to have a pigmentation problem, and I think that now, no matter what kind of a case some bastard could make against your getting married, there would be only one thing worse, and that would be if - knowing what you two are and knowing what you two have and knowing what you two feel- you didn't get married.

mky8zsr,1jpa3ft,reddit,"Cold Dog Soup (1990) starring Frank Whaley Jr and Randy Quaid. It was produced by George Harrison’s Handmade Films.

Frank Whaley Jr plays a guy who meets a girl at the pool, she has one massive fake hand for no reason. She invites him to dinner with suggestions of sex. When he gets there he realizes he’s having dinner with the woman, her elderly mother and their dog Jasper.  

The dog Jasper suddenly dies during dinner and the mother begs Whaley Jr to go bury the dog in the park across the street. His date promises to be very grateful if he does it wink wink. While he’s across the street digging the hole to bury this dead dog, Randy Quaid’s taxi driver appears out of nowhere spouting lines of cryptic wisdom and telling him he knows a place that can sell the dead dog. 

The rest of the movie is Frank Whaley Jr and Randy Quaid flying around the city at night trying to sell a dead dog to various bizarre characters while Whaley Jr desperately tries to get back to his date.

It’s a not very well known all in one night movie. It’s only on The Criterion Channel for streaming as far as I can see.

Also, One Wild Night aka Career Opportunities (1991). Frank Whaley Jr again with Jennifer Connolly. They both get locked in a department store all night and have to fend off robbers.",2025-04-02 00:57:04,1,immagoodboythistime,movies

A Working Man - 6.5/10. One of 2024’s biggest surprise hits (commercially and critically) was “The Beekeeper.” So, it was pretty obvious and inevitable that David Ayer and Jason Statham would team up again. And they teamed up in quick fashion for this film. And it shows, because even though there’s some of the good you found in Beekeeper, unfortunately, this feels like a rushed project. Don’t get me wrong though, the action is still fun and Statham is at his Stathamist best. I guess he’s at the point in his career where he’s just decided to play adrenaline based action first, talk later characters. The man plays another force of nature character, one whose again trying to shake off the past life, but is thrown into the throughs of things due to sentimental reasons. Whose he targeting now you ask? Human traffickers. I can’t lie when I got happy seeing Statham demolish and go full on unconscious rage as he tries to save this young woman’s life (especially when he just kills the traffickers with no remorse or sympathy). The problem here is that, unlike Beekeeper, there’s no real singular effective villain (its a network), nor are the visuals or editing up to par. Speaking of the villain(s), they are comically caricatured and cartoonish here. I get it they’re supposed to cliches, but even cliches need some different spins too! It truly feels like they rushed this project to release very soon, because the editing feels a little rushed, and the visuals feel frenetic in a not so great way. What Ayer and Statham did well in their previous collab was creating the world that the one man wrecking crew would go through, while also giving the character some obstacles and a tougher path to get to where he needs to go. Here, I felt that Statham’s character is having an easy go at things. Not once during a fight do you see the man get nicked by a shot or cut from a knife. He’s dirtied and roughed up, but he doesn’t show any signs of hardship or trouble during his mission. Even in Arnold or Sly films (was surprised to learn Sly helped write the story here), you can see those titans getting some wounds along the way for the most part. As an action lover, the action was fun, but a step down from Beekeeper. Did it pass the time? Yep. But I felt that had they taken a little bit more time, they could’ve made a nice continuation of a surprise hit. Decent, but will be more for Statham fans!",2025-04-02 20:09:08,2,ViewsOfCinema,movies

You blow on the barrel not just to get rid of smoke to check the barrel (they produced much more than modern guns), but also to make sure it doesn't have any embers inside of it that might make reloading dangerous. So it's likely just an anachronism carried over from stories about gunfights with the victorious shooters blowing on their guns. I've also heard of people blowing into breech loaded rifles in order to reduce the amount of residue that settles in the chamber but that's not really the cliche. ",2025-04-17 16:46:36,47,Ordinaryundone,movies

There was also. ""‘fanning the hammer"" which and article about gunfighting in 1889 said “it is doubtful if anybody yet has succeeded in firing six consecutive balls into the same township by fanning the hammer.”

Back in 1930 Wyatt Earp biographer Stuart Lake quoted Wyatt’s blunt views about gun handling: “In all my life as a frontier peace officer, I did not know a really proficient gunfighter who had anything but contempt for the gun fanner, or the man who literally shot from the hip.…From my experience…I can only support the opinion advanced by the men who gave me my most valuable instruction in fast and accurate shooting—which was that the gun fanner and the hip shooter stood small chance to live against a man who…took his time and pulled the trigger once.”",2025-04-17 16:34:05,0,Captain_Aware4503,movies

mmheya6,1jwc8mb,reddit,"Wrote about this before, so might as well write about it again…

*The Outfit* is an adaptation of the third novel in the “Parker” series.  Written by “Richard Stark”, the pen name for Donald Westlake, the series focused on the character of Parker, a hardened sociopathic criminal who will not let anything stand in the way of getting what he wants.

The novel, and by turn movie, is almost a second/concluding part to the first novel in the Parker series, *The Hunter*.  That novel was first adapted starring Lee Marvin in 1967 as *Point Blank*.  Years later it would be adapted again with Mel Gibson in *Payback*.  Other novels in the series were also adapted and if you’re curious, check ‘em out!

Funny thing about most of the movies, though: During his lifetime Donald Westlake forbid the studios to use the “Parker” name for the main character.  Thus, Lee Marvin in *Point Blank* is called “Walker”.  Robert Duvall in *The Outfit* is called “Machlin”.  Mel Gibson in *Payback* is “Porter”.  But they’re all, ultimately, Parker and it’s curious that after Westlake’s passing Jason Statham starred in yet another adaptation of one of the novels but finally the character -and movie!- were called *Parker*.

Why did Westlake not want the name used?  Supposedly he grew to not like having called the character that name.  He stated, rather humorously, that he was in mortal fear of one day having to write “Parker parked his car”…!

Anyway, check out *Point Blank* if you haven’t already.  IMHO, the very best adaptation of any of Westlake’s novels!",2025-04-11 00:23:41,9,Corrosive-Knights,movies

mnyippb,1k2u8eo,reddit,"1: David Edelstein (retired?)

Best film critic, and frequently cited as such by people in the industry, but hasn't been writing lately. He got cancelled/fired from one publication for making a joke about butter on his private friends and family only Facebook account, and then got pink slipped in a wider round of layoffs from NYMag. I think he's 66 now, so we could have gotten more, but it seems he's given up trying to be an old white guy with movie opinions in a world that doesn't appreciate that as much.

2: Gene Siskel (deceased)

I preferred Gene Siskel to Roger Ebert as a critic. Ebert was a great historian and essayist, but I fundamentally disliked his arguments for and against individual movies. Ebert was the heart, Siskel was the brain. I often butt heads with people who just like what they like when they like it and hate what they hate because they do, and it felt like Siskel found himself in that situation a lot. He died of cancer, but old episodes of At The Movies are easy to find and still compelling.

3: Christy Lemire (mostly just podcasting now)

Was passed the torch by Roger Ebert. She was briefly one of the two TV replacements when a revival of At the Movies was attempted, and then continued as a critic on his website for a long time. She still (rarely) posts a written review, but went with the tide by spending her efforts on casual chit chat podcasting instead. Most of her recent ""reviews"" listed on Rottentomatoes are just random quotes taken from those discussions, but hey, she was a great writer once, and at least her perspective is still in circulation.

4: A.O. Scott (retired)

The New York Times had been a reliable source thanks to A.O. Scott. He gave up for the reason, publicly, that most only said in private after critic screenings. He feels movie audiences are disconnected from critical thought, and describes fandom culture as ""rooted in conformity, obedience, group identity and mob behavior"". That might sound intolerant, but as a hardcore comics nerd myself, I fully agree with it. I could go on about this, but suffice to say, I took the temperature of things when I worked as a film critic myself, and totally get why A.O. Scott left his lifelong career as a film critic to review books instead.

I've spent a lot of time looking for replacement critics, but still haven't found anyone who comes close.

mlxlid4,1jtvo5u,reddit,"Me and early and the dying girl, the way way back, and adventureland are closest to what you're looking for.  

If you want realistic family dynamics with some quirky characters and good  character arcs, i recommend Pieces of April. 

It's kindve a funny story is very similar in tone as well and is definitely coming of age, id lump it in with the first four films I mentioned with how similar it is to what you've listed.

Coming of age are my favorite types of films.

 I'd also recommend better living through chemistry. Has sam rockwell, Olivia Wilde, etc. it's more like office space but gives similar vibes as well with the character arcs and such. It's a little goofier and less grounded in reality but it's a really fun watch

Sam Rockwell is also in the way way back. That movie is absolutely must watch for someone with your taste

If you just want good coming of age movies I also recommend sing street, the holdovers and maybe even submarine.

Another movie I think you'd enjoy and is severely underrated is wrist cutters: a love story. One of the most creative movies I've ever seen, gives me a similar feel to garden state although it's nothing like it. More people need to see it.

Lars and the real girl - you may like but I found it too sad to lump in with the films you mentioned.

 Wes Anderson movies are fantastic and have quirky characters but the only ones I see being truly similar to what you're looking for are bottle rocket and Rushmore.

That is my definitive list of similar films worth watching as of now, if I think of anymore I'll update this. you have good taste

High fidelity - I'd consider it coming of age, it's a lot different thematically with the flashbacks and narrator, but it gives that similar feeling. All these movies make me feel melancholy, but also hopeful and sometimes happy.

mlk4jpr,1js4ek6,reddit,"Be very careful with learning from movies and TV shows.  You will pick up some pretty rough Japanese.  Something thst sounds very normal to us will be horribly offensive if used in most situations.   The example I usually give is that there are several ways to say 'you' in Japanese and several of them are usually subtitled as bastard or worse.  You are just using an informal way to say 'you' but using it with someone outside your group can get you into an argument very quickly. 

So pay attention to who the people are talking to in the movies and focus on modern movies where the character is talking to a superior and learn that to be safe.

mkdb22f,1jmof6x,reddit,"This is a tough question to answer without going back to older films that established the tropes and conventions of modern filmmaking. It's your choice if you want to do that, that's less in my wheelhouse.

I can't comment on Spanish dubs, but if your parents are religious, the Prince of Egypt is an excellent animated film about Moses and the 10 plagues. If they already know the biblical story, the movie will be easy to understand, and it introduces them to American animation and musicals.

In a similar vein, a historical drama or sword-and-sandal epic may be fairly accessible, depending on their knowledge. I'm a big fan of Gladiator and Monty Python's Holy Grail, one introduces action and one leans heavily into comedy. Other options include Braveheart, Ben-Hur, and Lawrence of Arabia, but those may be a bit long and boring for your family.

I'd also recommend any film that's contained to a limited space and cast for accessibility. The first that come to mind are Fences, Breakfast Club, and maybe Rear Window. Ex Machina also fills this category but may be a bit 'out there'. I also group Lady Bird in with this vibe if not this category.

If you'd like to go into foreign films that may not have good dubbed options, Bicycle Thieves is an excellent older Italian film that's both easily understandable and heartbreaking. If you want something a bit more modern, La Haine is a French film about young men in an immigrant community. I took a film course at my community college and those were two that stuck with me.

The list on that government page is sort of weird, admittedly. It goes by year of induction down to about 2016, then it suddenly shifts to being alphabetical. (wikipedia also has [an entirely alphabetical list here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Film_Registry))

You can scan it for films with which you are familiar, or perhaps ctrl+f by decades with something like ""199\_"" for 90s films or similar.

Be aware that it includes non-narrative films. It has *Wizard of Oz*, *Shrek*, and... the Zapruder film. (lol)

For some easy, somewhat obvious black & white films, you have: *Casablanca*, *12 Angry Men*, and maybe even something like *Lilies of the Field*. (At the least, if you see a movie with a legendary actor like Sidney Poitier you can then pick some of his other hits.)

For modern pics... I suppose I would lean toward ""exciting"" movies, honestly.  Perhaps they wouldn't *quite* get films like *The Big Lebowski* that somehow just make sense to people who grew up in the cultures represented, but they may enjoy an interesting detective story in something like ***L.A.

Because of my wife, I won't watch it.  Even by myself, because it makes me think about how my wife doesn't like it.  I know that makes no sense, but it is what it is.

A River Runs Through It is another one that my wife doesn't want to watch again because of the ending.  Another one of my favorite movies, but has a depressing ending.

I don't mind depressing endings, but my wife hates them so that rubs off on me somehow.  I like movies for what they are.  Sometimes life doesn't end great.  Still, you have to try and they are both good movies.

Still, in my head, I'm not allowed to watch them because my wife doesn't like the endings.  We've been married for 26 years so it's not like it's a new thing.  It just means I can't watch 2 of my favorite movies because I worry about how my wife would feel.

Shown in IMAX, and everything was fine through the ads and the IMAX intro bit, but when the film itself started, it kept on flickering in and out. About 5 minutes in, the staff fixed and restarted it.

After the film, I overheard staff talking about it, and it was something to do with the film *not* being actual IMAX format, yet the ads were.

What made it all the more hilarious is at the start, there was a card noting that the film isn’t true IMAX, but at the end, there was an ad about the “true IMAX experience” or something to that effect. The audience just laughed at how ridiculous it was.

Similarly, when I saw the *Witch Watch: Watch Party* theatrical preview a week later, at the same cinema. The screen initially cut off half of the subtitles, making them harder to read. About 10 minutes later, the screen zoomed out - presumably because the projectionist assumed it would have a theatrical aspect ratio and not one used for television.

mmh3g86,1jvsj8d,reddit,"Many movies I can remember where I had some technical issues.



Lilo & Stitch (2002): Fire alarm went off (can’t remember during what scene) and I believe the movie resumed. Was my first technical issue during any movie at any movie theater.

King Kong (2005): Not sure if the fire alarm went off, but I think there was heavy rain during that time that caused the projector to stop for a bit. Came back on before Kong’s battle with the planes and his death that was killed by Beauty.

Rise of the Planet of the Apes: Fire alarm also went off in a scene during a fight between the main character’s father and his unruly neighbor before Caesar was subsequently taken to the ape shelter. As we were evacuating, one of the moviegoers thought it was part of the movie when Caesar attacked that idiotic neighbor, which was crazy. Resumed exactly where it left off where he then injured him (getting what he deserved) after defending the prior.

Alvin and the Chipmunks 3: Aspect ratio inadvertently swapped to 2.39:1 throughout the film.

Home Alone (2015 re-release): Thankfully no fire alarm this time. The special engagement movie event wouldn’t start the movie at all after the pre-show due to projection issues, so we got free passes. Would’ve loved to experience it in the theater on that 25th anniversary of the first one since I wasn’t born when it came out.

Early Man: Only the policy trailer occurred after the glitch screen, going straight to the previews. No pre-show content (as well as no commercials) beforehand. Like Alvin 3, the aspect ratio was accidentally swapped to 2.39:1 throughout the film also (when I know they’re actually 1.85:1), covering the top and bottom, which was probably the result of a glitch from earlier. Very distracting!

Toy Story 4: It went to black (along with no audio during that technical issue) for a minute during Gabby Gabby’s emotional departure from the gang, which disrupted the saddest moment. Resumed but rewound about a minute or two.

Jurassic World Dominion: Pre-show started, but no previews afterwards. Had to wait about 10-15 minutes for it to start. Movie finally started, except it started about 30-40 seconds into this movie from the opening logos.

Champions: No pre-show (unlike Jurassic World 3) and no previews. Went straight to the film.

It’s a slow moving log flume ride and we were in the middle of an expansive part of the ride with no access to a spot to get out of. At first it was funny, then I thought maybe we’d make out or something (didn’t happen), then we were very bored. They cleared everyone out and we were legitimately the last people to get off. Thankfully they turned on the lights and turned off the animatronics and music and everything so we didn’t loose our minds. Then we eventually got pushed to an escape and got to walk through the inside of the ride and then they let us get anything we wanted from the gift shop and I got the biggest fucking sombrero I had ever seen. It didn’t fit through doorways lol.

We went to Disney with my family and this girl I liked but we went on the ride ourselves. We didn’t have cell phones and my family genuinely thought we died. Which was why we were allowed whatever from the gift shop. Never found out what happened. 

Looking back this seems like such a massive lawsuit if something happened and we couldn’t escape but I guess if it was really bad we could’ve just got in the water. But what if the water was electrified or something",2025-04-10 13:14:12,1,jspivak,movies

Hot summer day, movie theater at Fort Ord near Monterey was packed with people trying to escape the heat.

Unfortunately the projector wasn't working right. It was an ancient carbon arc type from the 1930's era. The sound was garbled. 

I had a technical services company in San Luis Obispo, and got a call from the theater asking if I worked on projectors. He got my number from a paper phone book (remember those?). Well, no I don't, I said, but I'm sure I can fix it. I jumped in my truck and raced up there. About a 2 hour drive. 

The problem turned out to be simple and easily fixed, and he fired up the projector and started the movie. The whole place erupted in applause and cheers. They'd probably been sitting in there for nearly three hours waiting.

The best part was I hung out in the projection booth and watched the movie with him... I've always wanted to do that! Unfortunately I can't remember what movie it was, but I think it was a Bond film.",2025-04-10 13:37:06,1,rdcpro,movies

[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m0029xr7](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m0029xr7) 

and the episode summary from the page:   
*Mickey was born in the early 1950s and his earliest memories from primary school involve crime. His father taught him how to fight, and opportunities to make enough money to go to the cinema presented themselves to him. As he entered adulthood, the trouble escalated.*

*Across four decades, Mickey was in and out of prison. Then a chance meeting with the filmmaker Guy Richie, and a further encounter with the screenwriter Tony Jordan, led Mickey into the world of storytelling and the big screen.*

*Dr Sally Tilt and Dr Kerensa Hocken are forensic psychologists who work in prisons. Their job is to help people who have committed crimes to understand the harm they’ve caused, identify why it happened and work out how to make changes to prevent further harm after they’ve been released.*

*In Behind the Crime, they take the time to understand the life of someone whose crimes have led to harm and prison.*

*Through this extended interview, we get to the heart of his behaviour and discover that there are two Mickeys.*",2025-04-07 12:23:29,6,invalidreddit,movies

But what I love the most is the way it inverts the idea of the super-know-it-all P.I. found in the Chandler and Hammett novels.  Hackman’s Harry Moseby is, to put it *very* bluntly, a *terrible* private investigator.  He is a nice guy, mind you, and he tries very hard, but unlike Phillip Marlowe or Sam Spade, he’s lost throughout the film and barely understands what’s going on around him.

The movie clues you in on this really early on (not a big spoiler as it happens in the first few minutes of the film) when, by total chance, he discovers his wife is cheating on him.

Think about it: He’s a private investigator.  His wife has been cheating on him and *he had no clue*.

Through the course of the film he stumbles around and discovers things mostly by accident but never really puts everything together.  He’s no Inspector Clouseau, he’s a really decent guy and, as I said, tries really hard, but he’s just no good at his job.

The whole thing about the famous chess move Moseby talks about midway through the film is a fascinating insight into the way he ticks.",2025-04-03 01:39:17,1,Corrosive-Knights,movies

moss8d9,1k6txn7,reddit,"There is an action/drama movie based on Bruce Lee's life:   
  
*Dragon - The Bruce Lee Story (1993)*

There's a ""main/subplot"" about Bruce's inner Demon - a creature that feeds on his failures and sadness, and it is represented as a menacing 2 meter tall eyeless samurai/mongol warrior that shows up from time to time in moments of sadness or frustration in Bruce's life.

When he does, the whole movie (that is supposed to be an action and drama piece) turns into something as a horror nightmare, where Bruce must face an almost unbeatable foe, there is a lot of fog/smoke, screams of people dying (like a feudal village being pillaged by warriors that are killing everyone in sight).

At one point, the Demon's objective shifts from Bruce to his son, Brandon, who is just a baby boy, forcing Bruce to face his Demon into battle.

This shift in tone got me and my brothers (all small at the time) completely by surprise and terrified us.

Got to see the movie recently and the design of the Demon still looks absolute amazing (and the movie too).",2025-04-24 14:58:35,4,cucamonster,movies

We had this on VHS when I was a teenager and I had/have a ridiculous crush on Jenna Elfman so I’ve seen this movie probably upwards of 30 times. It’s one of those movies that are harmless enough that you’d let a kid watch it a bunch, yet under the surface there is an extremely horny love story and I was definitely picking up on that as a kid, but it’s also got this Nora Ephron-esque New York gloss over it that feels so pre-9/11. Crazy that famously difficult and artistic Edward Norton directed this, and it’s certainly not on the level of movies like it such as Harry Met Sally, Crossing Delancey, or Moonstruck, but this is a solid 6/10 good time.
