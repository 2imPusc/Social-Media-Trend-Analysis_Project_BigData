- seared the pork balls, put them into the sauce, cooked about an hour or so, cooked off the sauce a little more on its own after the balls were done to drive off some liquid.

mnn65qy,1k1m3q6,reddit,"Hi:-) So l've made some potato pancakes (direct translation from my language), not sure
how else to call these. :-)


If you want to try it, here you go


The dough: 
●6 Potatos (not small ones, middle size )
●1 1/2 -2 - cups flour (1 mean a tea cup for example)
●2 garlic gloves 
●1 egg 
●dill to your taste
● 1 tsp baking power 
●salt, pepper, paprika to your taste

Cold butter or ghee (to spread it on the hot pancake)


The yoghurt-garlic dip: 
■ 5 garlic gloves
■ yoghurt 200 gr
■ dill to your taste 
■salt to your taste


1. Boil the potatos, mash them once their done. Let it
cool off a bit.

2. Add salt, pepper, paprika, garlic (1 used a garlic
press), the egg and dill, then mix it.

3. Add the flour and baking powder, then knead the
dough

4.  Form dough balls and dust them with a little flour
just SO the dough won't stick to your rolling pin (you
can make them bigger or smaller, resulting in bigger
or smaller pancakes)

5. Roll them out with a rolling pin and bake them one
by one one in a pan ( the stove shouldn't be too hot,
I used 6 for the first one, then put the heat down to 4
once the pan was hot enough already), without any
oil.

6. Once the pancake is done, spread some cold
butter or ghee all over it, put a bowl on top of it
so they stay hot while you continue repeating the
process.


The dip:

Use a garlic press or just mince it very finely. Add
the garlic into a bowl, add your yoghurt, some salt
and dill (lf you want)

We had some black tea with it. That may be a little
weird for you guys, but where I come from, we usually have a cup of tea with food like that.

If someone tries it, let me know :-) would be
interesting to know if you liked it.",2025-04-17 20:02:26,8,Rayhana95_,food

mmww8ef,1jyav7m,reddit,"# Ingredients

* 3 lbs russet potatoes peeled and thinly sliced
* 2 tsp olive oil
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp pepper
* 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese
* 1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
* 1 cup diced ham
* 2 cups heavy cream
* 2 tsp Dijon mustard
* 3 cloves grated or minced garlic

# Instructions

* **Preheat the oven** to 450°F. In a large bowl, toss the thinly sliced potatoes with olive oil, salt, and pepper until evenly coated.
* In a medium saucepan, combine the heavy cream, garlic, and Dijon mustard. Whisk until smooth, then heat over medium until the mixture is warm and just beginning to bubble. Remove from heat.
* Line a 9×13 sheet pan with parchment paper. Arrange half of the sliced potatoes in an even layer on the pan. Sprinkle half of the diced ham and half of the shredded cheddar cheese evenly over the potatoes.
* Layer the remaining potato slices on top, then carefully pour the warm cream mixture over the entire dish, making sure it seeps into the layers.
* **Bake** for 20 minutes covered. Then, remove the foil and sprinkle the remaining cheddar cheese and the Parmesan cheese on top. **Return to the oven** and bake uncovered for an additional 30 minutes, or until the potatoes are fork-tender and the top is golden and crispy.
* **Let the dish rest** for 10 minutes before serving. Finish with a sprinkle of sliced scallions or chopped chives for a fresh, flavorful finish.",2025-04-13 15:58:18,5,lonelyisland789,food

mmq2e27,1jxg7js,reddit,"Ingredients:

3 overripe banana medium size (7/8"" long)

1 cup brown rice syrup or 3/4 cup maple 
syrup

1 1/2 cup gluten free rolled oats

1 cup wholewheat flour

2 tbsp. ground flax seeds

1 1/2 tsp baking soda

1/4 cup melted coconut oil

1 tbsp. vanilla extract

1 tsp. ground cinnamon

Optional toppings:
1 small banana sliced
2 tablespoons jumbo oat
2 tablespoons brown rice syrup or maple syrup

Method:

Preheat oven to 180 C (375F).

Prepare a rectangle loaf tin 23 cm x 13 cm (9"" x 5"") covered with baking paper. Set aside.

Add all the banana bread ingredients into the bowl of a food processor with the S blade attachment. 

Start with the dry ingredients first flour, oat, baking soda, cinnamon, ground flax seed then coconut oil, brown rice syrup, vanilla extract and whole ripe banana.

Blend on low speed 30 seconds. Stop scrap down the sides with a spatula and repeat this process until you obtain a thick batter with no more lumps of banana.

Pour the batter into the prepared loaf tin.

Decorate the top with slices of fresh banana, brush the top of the banana bread with maple syrup and sprinkle some extra jumbo oat if you like.

Bake 45-55 minutes or until a chopstick inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean.

You may need to protect the top of the bread with a piece of foil during the last 15 minutes of baking to avoid the banana slices to burn.

Fully cool down in the loaf tin before transferring into a cooling rack.

Store wrap into a towel to keep all the moisture of this banana bread or pres-slice the bread and store in the pantry wrap individually into plastic wrap.

Store well up to 5 days in the pantry at room temperature.",2025-04-12 12:37:43,5,doorshock,food

Based on your pizza slice picture, the crumb looks a bit dense there. How much water to dough do you put in? Some more water and hotter baking temperatures may help you here. You may also need to stretch out the pizza more  to speed up the cooking process. 

Others have mentioned Brian Lagerstrom videos. His 1 dough 3 pizzas video gives clear instructions on how to make a Neapolitan like pizza, but there are other good videos out there. ",2025-04-01 03:56:09,1,HowitzerIII,food

mnsj05j,1k27iwl,reddit,Liangpi is my favorite cold dish from China. I also love their cousin the liangpi burrito (not sure what it’s called in Chinese).,2025-04-18 17:28:50,8,DivineFlamingo,food
mntgha7,1k27iwl,reddit,"For reference, 'cold skin' is just a translation for the name of the dish. Liangpi is made of fresh starch noodles (sometimes wheat).

It's topped with a spicy chili oil based sauce with soy sauce, black vinegar, Sichuan peppercorn, and garlic. Often served with cold julienned cucumber, cilantro, and wheat gluten.

It's served cold and it's the spicy salty sour cold noodle dish of your dreams. It's genuinely one of the best things you could eat on a hot day. 

You're immediately hit with the chewy cold noodles and crisp cucumber, followed by the refreshing tartness of the black vinegar first in that sauce, then the salty spicy of the soy and chili oil joins the mix. 

That's when the magic starts. 

The heat from the chili oil and the numbing sensation from the Sichuan peppercorn makes your mouth water and puts your tongue and nose into overdrive. 

The cold noodles and cucumber drives away the burning in your mouth, but you keep coming back for more in a vicious cycle of satisfying burning and delicious cooling.

* 6lbs boneless chicken thigh
* 1/2 cup soy sauce
* 1/2 cup ketchup
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 1/3 cup white wine
* 1 tbsp Worcestershire
* 2 tbsp minced garlic
* 2 tbsp minced ginger


Combine ingredients in sealable bag and marinate for 4 hours. Grill on high for about 15 min, then on inderect heat for another 10-15, brushing additional marinade and turning every 5-6 minutes. 


First time making this! Came out great, will definitely do again. I made a small bowl of extra marinade with some fresh pineapple and orange juice added for more brightness and tang, and used that to brush the chicken as it grilled. I'm aware pineapple is not inherently Hawaiian or normally included in Huli Huli, my two hours of research yesterday told me as much, but I like pineapple so I added some to the glaze.

mlm5k6z,1jsfv0w,reddit,"Recipe notes:

\- Had some chicken breast, and I love a good and easy (enough) cast iron meal

\- Thawed the chicken, salted it well, and racked it for a 6 hours in the fridge to dry.

\- Began heating up the cast iron as I chopped my veg (1 big stalk of celery, 1.5 medium onions, 6 mini sweet peppers, 2 cloves of garlic + tomato, as per photo)

\- Olive oil into the hot pan (on medium, medium low, banking on heat inertia), lay chicken down the the sear, fresh ground pepper on as it cooks. Did both sides, and set aside the breasts. Added the tomato in there to help with removing the skin later.

\- I deglazed the pan with some butter, added some flour to make a roux of the bottom of the pan. Added about 1 cup of chicken stock (half a cube in about a cup of water) and 1/2 cup of milk (all I had), let it come together, clear pan and set aside roux 1.

\- After clearing the pan, back onto the burner, turned up the heat a bit, dropped olive oil and then the garlic, fried off until becoming golden, dropped in rest of veg. A bit of salt. Skinned tomato, and added it into the veg, fried it off steadily, good pinch of thyme, a little extra pepper. I finished it with a little butter and a bit of flour and a touch of water to make a thin roux mixed into the veg, topped with a dash of vinegar and Worcestershire.

\- Combined roux 1 and veg-roux 2 in the pan, taste, seasoning is on point, dropped in the chicken breast, foiled the pan, and popped it in the oven at 325F for 45min, foil off for 30, and a little blast under the broiler.

Result: Insane gravy - so much depth of flavour. My roommate pulled out some instant mash, a bit sacrilege, but whatever, I was tired of cooking. Set the chicken on the mash, gravy all around. Pull-apart chicken goodness. Outrageously delicious meal.

edit: forgot a dash of vinegar and Worcestershire
edit 2: i admit there's something left to be desired for looks, but that's basically a sieve and some fancy legwork. The idea was to keep it to one pan.",2025-04-05 23:08:29,7,crimsontape,food

mlon1g6,1jsfv0w,reddit,"It’s weird how this differs so much from country to country. 

In Germany, you make a roux and add white wine and broth, a dash of heavy cream and nutmeg. 

Then you add in shred chicken, mushrooms, white asparagus and pickled capers.

Ingredients:

2 small tomatoes, cut in cubes
4 tbsp. extra virgin olive oil
1 large lemon, juice and zest needed
2 small shallots, optional
water to cover bulgur with
sea salt and white pepper to taste

How to make it:
Prepare Bulgur: In a large mixing bowl add water (to triple cover bulgur) and squeezed fresh lemon juice.
Then, pour the bulgur wheat into the bowl and let soak for 30 minutes (or more if needed). Bulgur should become soft and double/triple in size*.
Drain bulgur wheat from excess water and set aside.
Prepare Salad: Chop parsley, mint and tomatoes finely (as well as shallots). Place into salad bowl and mix.
Assemble: Add bulgur to rest of the ingredients, season with lemon zest, olive oil, salt and pepper to taste. Keep in the fridge for 10-15 minutes and serve.",2025-04-15 05:52:32,7,Classic_Ad_7733,food

➡️ now, the cookie dough is done ✅ make it into a rectangular shape with at least 1 cm thickness, wrap it up and put it in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes to cool it down. 
Take the dough out and cut it into small pieces (3*3 cm and 1 cm thick here). Glaze with a mixture of yolk and honey. Put the cookies back in refrigerator for another 15-20 minutes. Glaze the top of cookies again.

And while I prefer thin cut kalbi / galbi, I like discount prices even more. With the thick cut, these were marinated overnight in a favorite kalbi / galbi sauce before cooking on the grill.

Enjoy & have a great weekend.

mobm25l,1k4mu7w,reddit,"I quickly wrote down a recipe as well. I hope some of you end up trying it!

**Ingredients**

* 200 g ground beef
* 1 small white onion, diced
* 3 garlic cloves, minced
* 2–3 peppers (red/yellow/green), chopped
* 2 medium potatoes (≈300 g), peeled & cubed
* 200 g diced tomatoes 
* 2 Tbsp oil + 1 Tbsp butter
* 2 eggs
* Salt, pepper, 1 tsp paprika, ½ tsp cumin

**How I do it**

1. Heat 2 Tbsp oil in a skillet over medium‑high. When it shimmers, add beef in one layer.
2. Let it brown untouched 1–2 min, sprinkle salt/pepper/paprika/cumin, stir 30 sec, then scoop into a bowl.
3. In the same pan, melt 1 Tbsp butter. Add potatoes, onion, garlic, peppers, season lightly, and cook 5–7 min until potatoes get golden bits.
4. Stir beef back in with 200 g diced tomatoes. Bring to a boil, lower to medium‑low, cover, and cook 12–15 min until potatoes are fork‑tender.
5. Crack 2 eggs on top, cover, turn off the heat, and let sit 5 min so the eggs steam‑cook. Season the eggs with smoked salt, pepper and smoked paprika once cooked.",2025-04-21 21:08:59,2,mrcookswell,food

mlw789w,1jtqizr,reddit,"So, not really a meal, but I thought I'd share:

\- Had 8lbs or so of spare onion - I have a bad habit of loving a good onion deal, what can I say!

\- Prep was easy. Chop the head, split, skin, chop the root end, roughly slice them (""against the grain"" of course)

\- I decided to salt them a little. For the 8lbs, I think I added about 2-3 tbsp of pink salt. I also added a good dose of liquid smoke (wanted to see the effect, it's very subtle; have to revisit the strategy).

\- Started my dehydrator at 155F, but about 6h in or so (honestly can't recall), I knocked it down to 120F. They were actually starting to roast a bit lol. Which is fine! It made them turn out a bit better than expected. The whole process took about 40h total.

Uses: they're awesome for tons of different stuff. I like blitzing them in my spice grinder for a nice, sweet onion kick in my seasonings. I've used them in rice. I rehydrated them to make onions for burgers. And actually, they eat a lot like a chip - they're really tasty just on their own lol. But ya, it's just a great way to avoid waste and use product you would otherwise throw away. The same can be done across a LOT of different veg. I've done it with peppers (awesome for making chili!), tomatoes (flavour bombs!!!), even pickles (good for a pickle flavour in a dressing or a seasoning). I wanna try zucchini and parboiled carrots to make homemade dry soup mix. Edit:oh ya, and breaking them down the flakes and mixing them with panko for enhanced breading 💪",2025-04-07 17:20:43,15,crimsontape,food

The orange stuff is my habanero sauce recipe 


Lacto fermented habanero sauce/salsa



1 lb habanero peppers (any peppers)(destemmed you can deseed if needed I don’t.)

1 large white onion (sliced to fit through mason jar opening)

1 whole garlic bulb 

1 large red bell pepper (or any color but green bell)

24 grams Canning salt 

1 quart cool Filtered water 

1 - half gallon wide mouth ball jar

Dark room temp location for 10 days



To do:

Wash all peppers. 

Peel garlic and add to jar

Slice bell pepper into slices that will fit into jar I usually cut into 8ths. 

Slice onion same way to fit through mouth of jar

Add habanero to jar 

Top with glass puck and press if needed to acquire more space. You want to leave about a half inch to inch in the top. 

Mix salt and water together until salt dissolves. Pour brine into jar until it covers the glass puck. 

Seal with ferment lids and use pump to remove excess air from jar. Place in a dark, room temp location undisturbed for 10 days. You can peek at the jar and see if there are bubbles forming and floating to the top. This means it’s working! Just don’t open it! 

After 10 days remove lid and assess. If done properly there may be some white film residue or what appears to be sea foam on the sides. This is a byproduct of some fermentations and is called Kahm yeast, perfectly harmless and naturally occurring. As long as there is no color (green, black) the mold can be wiped away. 

Strain the fermented pepper mix to over a large bowl and collect the fermented brine. Add the pepper mix to a blender. (Watch the fumes they’ll gas you) blend and slowly add more brine to reach the desired consistency. You can save any left over brine and add cucumbers to make some spicy pickles or what ever you want.  


Refrigerate after bottling. Serve chilled. Do not cook the salsa as it will lose any probiotic value. Chilled shelf life at least 6 months. But I have never had it last that long. Shits good yo.",2025-04-01 01:27:27,2,t-o-m-u-s-a,food

Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Beat brown sugar, 1/2 butter, with an electric mixer in a separate large bowl until smooth. Stir in eggs and mashed bananas until well blended. Stir banana mixture into flour mixture until just combined. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.

Use 1/4 cup butter, brown sugar, splash of vanilla, chopped pecans and mix together making a crumble.

Bake in the preheated oven for 50 min, pull bread out, put crumble in the center of your loaf, spread maple syrup around top of loaf. Bake another 10 min until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 60 minutes total.

Let bread cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.

1) Utilize the soft sliced bread (similar to the soft bread slice from Japan)

mlpfojd,1jsvb7u,reddit,"# For the Shrimp Stir-fry~

* 12-16 large shrimp deveined and peeled
* 1 tbsp of neutral oil for cooking
* 1 diced onion
* 1 diced green or red bell pepper
* 1 cup of a chopped veggie of choice (I used green beans)

# For the Sauce~

* 1.5 tbsp gochujang paste
* 2 tbsp honey
* 2 tbsp soy sauce
* 2 tsp sesame oil
* 3 cloves of garlic minced
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder
* 1/4 tsp of salt and pepper
* sesame seeds and green onions for a garnish

# Instructions

* **Prepare the Shrimp & Sauce-** If using frozen shrimp, thaw them first. In a small bowl, whisk together the gochujang paste, honey, soy sauce, sesame oil, and minced garlic. Set aside.
* **Cook the Vegetables-** Heat a large pan over medium heat and add 1 tbsp of oil. Add the diced onion, bell pepper, and chopped green beans. Sauté for about 5 minutes, or until the vegetables are softened.
* **Cook the Shrimp-** Push the vegetables to the side of the pan and add the shrimp to the center. Season with salt, black pepper, and garlic powder. Cook for about 3 minutes per side, until the shrimp are opaque and cooked through.
* **Add the Sauce-** Pour the prepared gochujang sauce over the shrimp and vegetables. Toss everything together to coat evenly. Let it simmer for 2-3 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.
* **Serve & Enjoy-** Spoon the stir-fry over steamed white rice. Garnish with sesame seeds and chopped green onions for extra flavor. Serve hot and enjoy!",2025-04-06 14:45:51,1,lonelyisland789,food
