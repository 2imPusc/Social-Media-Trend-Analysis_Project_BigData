gaming,1jpp91z,ml0w02e,Launching Switch 2 with Mario Kart is a great decision. One of the favourite Nintendo games in my opinion.,37,2025-04-02 14:01:50,RealFlummi
gaming,1jpp91z,ml0xhtq,"2 Months till release and no price

gaming,1jpp91z,ml0y59z,"Not gonna lie, I'm not THAT excited. And I'm kind of glad, because I need to save money right now. Maybe it's just because I'm not a big Nintendo guy in general, my Switch doesn't get used much.

The Switch 2 itself is basically just a more powerful Switch. All the specs about the resolution and frame rate targets were kind of what was expected, and would be really weird if not on a modern console.

Games wise...again, I'm not really a Nintendo guy. I bought my Switch for Pokémon, but then Dexit happened so it doesn't even get used for that anymore. Mario Kart is Mario Kart. By which I mean they're basically all the same, it's just a formality at this point for a new Nintendo system, so that doesn't thrill me. The new Donkey Kong and Kirby games are the kind of thing I'd probably enjoy if I played them, but I likely never will.

Paid next gen upgrades is kind of bullshit when that stuff on PlayStation and Xbox is almost always free. It's nice that this is a thing at all though. Metroid Prime 4 even having modern-day quality and performance modes was really shocking. Kind of hoped maybe they'd have Switch 2 versions of the Gen 8 and 9 Pokémon games, but hey, it still wouldn't fix my biggest issue with those games!

Gamecube on Switch Online sounds nice, until you realise this means the best version of Wind Waker is going to forever be confined to Wii U though. Twilight Princess too, I assume. Glad I still have that thing around! But hey, did I see they're finally acknowledging Pokémon Colosseum and XD? That's shocking.

The lack of price details makes me think it's embarrassingly high and they wanted to make us check the website so they didn't have to stand there with a straight face.

Yeah...I see why people might be excited for this. But as a self-confessed ""Not really a Nintendo guy"", who needs to save money anyway, I shan't be rushing out to get one. Maybe in a year or 2 if something is out I see a need for.

gaming,1k3cy4e,mo190ni,"ARPG's (diablo, path of exile, last epoch, ect.) are great for listening to auxiliary audio because those games rarely have audio queues you need to worry about, and generally speaking when they do have important audio queues its really really late game uber boss situations. For the vast (90%+) majority of gameplay ARGs don't need audio.

Old School Runescape is a good game that you don't need audio for most of the content, and due to its open world nature you can really pick and choose whenever you want to go do something that does benefit from having the game audio on.

I hesitate to suggest Dark Souls, Monster Hunter, or games with a similar combat structure because those games often require a certain amount of focus that can take your attention away from whatever your listening to, and you mentioned wanting to listen to podcasts which would kind of defeat the point.

Any game where the main focus is to build stuff. The most obvious one that comes to mind is Minecraft, but there are certainly others.",108,2025-04-20 03:07:02,LastTourniquet

If you need some ideas, maybe try looking at other cel shaded games for some inspiration? Okami's Amaterasu would probably look great. Or one of the many Zelda stained glass windows that show up in the games. Windwaker has several in its official art, and the other Zelda titles in that style would probably translate well (like Minish Cap).

Actually, I've known a lot of women who really enjoy playing Skyrim and that game is great for getting used to a controller since it's so accommodating for mistakes. Plus you can cover a lot of different, common ways of using a controller since you have to aim, move, melee attack, etc. My two cents, but ask her what she thinks might be cool to play, and she'll be more open to learning.",24,2025-04-16 20:41:21,ShiQiaoke

gaming,1k0uqn9,mnh6tjx,"Portal 2 always sounds good in theory, but in the two times I tried to play with a SO it went poorly for two primary reasons. 

One, more relevant to this post, Portal requires a degree of reaction time that someone who's played games their whole life takes for granted. People who don't have that native reflex have a hard time moving the character and the camera at the same time in harmony, let alone doing it timely and accurately. 

Two, portal 2 is frustrating to play with mismatched portal-puzzle-solving ability, which I assume you have more of than her. It's likely it'll be frustrating for her having you figure out the puzzle before she even recognizes the pieces at play. Combined with point one, solving the puzzle then waiting for her to be able to execute the moves for it can be frustrating for you, too. If you solve this by deferring to her entirely, be honest with yourself if you have the patience for that (I did not). 

If you wanna do Portal 2 together, I'd recommend having her do Portal 1 on her own to at least get some training wheels in both regards. Otherwise, my biggest recommendation is actually Baldurs Gate 3. I know it seems intense, but nothing is timed or reaction based. She'll love creating a character, and if shes intimidated or isn't interested in the ""building"" part you can totally just build and handle the level ups for the character for her; in her vision, of course.",8,2025-04-16 21:09:32,CapNCookM8

gaming,1jvlpgc,mmbbbdt,"Absolutely agree, Division’s version of NYC feels lived-in in a way that few games pull off. The detail in every alley, storefront, and rooftop makes it so immersive, even if you've never been there in real life. I remember getting distracted from missions just because I stumbled into some flooded basement or broken building and wanted to see what was tucked away. Also, there’s something about that snow covered chaos during Christmas in Division 1 that hits different like it captures a weird blend of beauty and despair. Between the weather effects, lighting, and how the world feels abandoned but not empty, it really nails the atmosphere. Division might not get as much mainstream love anymore, but it’s easily one of the best examples of environmental storytelling through world design.",33,2025-04-10 01:13:43,HelloAnxiety1992

But I never had the time I could dedicate to raiding when I was in high school, and by the time I was out , gates had launched and was a disaster of an expansion, and all my friends had left for WoW or other games, like City of Heroes, or Final Fantasy XI:O , so I too went to different games, having never seen vex thal , or plane of time, or even just plane of fire. 


Then a few years ago during lockdown I found an emu server that was in planes of power and trying to recreate the content to as close to original as they could, as far as encounter scripting and difficulty go. 


And after thinking about EverQuests early game off and on for 20ish years, I finally got in a guild and was ""Uber"" and killed Quarm . And not only that but got bored of killing him on my main, and got an alt leveled and flagged up and got quarm loot on him too :) then the server launched gates of discord, and covid-cation was well over, and I just had to turn to being an adult and not play EverQuest forever.

Hard as hell and you get stuck on the same level for like a half hour, but once you get through it’s this great sense of accomplishment followed immediately by a slightly tougher challenge that once you attempt once and fail you need to beat it!

The only reason I gave up was you eventually get to a place where the only way forward is to go back and redo all the old levels to 100% them, and that just seemed too tedious. But that was basically in the post game, for people wanting even harder challenges.",16,2025-04-22 13:32:44,-KFBR392

I find them way more enjoyable to play and honestly really wish they’d remake the first 3 using this more linear approach.  I really like how the ghosts kind of lead you where you need to go and I love being able to trade spirit points for healing items and more powerful film at save points.  The older games would have been so much better and tolerable with these features.  ",0,2025-04-14 02:32:23,Lower-Solid2943

gaming,1jyqihs,mn5quzl,"**I'm 30 hours in** and I'd say this is one of the few games where the environmental design is so good that it doesn't matter if the world is empty per se, because the variety of the landscapes — and rarely even the navigation itself — is engaging.

The world also does a good job of dangling the proverbial carrot in front of your face, teasing places that you'll be able to finally see once you get a Skell (mech).

Unlocking the Overdrive mechanic gave the game a much more satisfying battle pace, frenetic and adding further complexity (although I am settling into a one-size-fits-all approach).

**Now for the bad takes.** I've settled into my old habits of sticking with almost the same build until it doesn't work, the one exception being that I temporarily switched to Beam weapons in Oblivia — if I try to find more challenge, I die too quickly to understand why I died.

Trying to execute commands, when time is of the essence, feels inaccessible and frustrating; a few examples would be moving to the other side of my Arts palette to respond to a Soul Call, and commanding my party members mid-battle to save their Tension Points so Revives are readily available.

But probably the worst part of XCX so far has been the formulaic sidequests, which are often required to a degree to progress the main story. I already knew a few important plot twists beforehand so the story hasn't gripped me yet, and I'm worried that the forced pacing is hampering my engagement.",6,2025-04-15 01:00:26,Chillyeaham

Personally, I enjoy the game moreso for _not_ rushing into the mechs.  I tend to max my time enjoying the world, it becomes such a small place and if you beeline for them then you miss out on a lot of exploration.  Getting the mech feels like adding a new perspective onto the world once you're already familiarized with it, and hopefully have some more regions unexplored.  I spent at least as much time as any other game just with the three areas of Primordia, Oblivia and Noctilum.

But you're free to enjoy the game however you choose.",12,2025-04-14 04:51:52,i010011010

gaming,1jyqihs,mn51ddw,"I've really been enjoying it, but I can't help but think that the Definitive Edition for Switch could've done with a few more QOL tweaks. While running in to powerful enemies and keeping you on your toes is interesting, it gets frustrating that some map design leads to scenarios where it's near impossible to keep something 30 levels higher than you, out of a mission's battle.

I've never been the biggest fan of maintaining gear for an entire party, but an entire squadron is even more obnoxious, especially considering that the game doesn't have an option in the Auto Equip section to pull gear off of people not in the party.

And if it were up to me, the Mechs would be slotted 1 through 4, and whoever was in that position would be registered to that mech. Buying and maintaining mechs/gear or re-registering mechs when the party changes, is irritating and feels dated.

You can join the discussions on the Outer Wilds subreddit, and join us in lamenting that it's a game we can never experience again.

Your English is just fine! Based on your description, the game you're remembering sounds a lot like **""Star Wars: Republic Commando""** (2005), but since you mentioned a red desert (possibly Mars) and rebels/terrorists (not droids or aliens), it might not be the one.  

A closer match could be **""Conflict: Global Terror""** (2005), a tactical shooter where you control a squad of four soldiers (similar to ODST armor) fighting terrorists across various locations, including desert environments. However, it's not set in the future.  

Another possibility is **""Land of the Dead: Road to Fiddler's Green""** (2005), but that's a zombie shooter, so probably not it.  

The most likely candidate based on your description (futuristic, Mars-like desert, squad-based, character switching) is:  
### **""Chrome: SpecForce""** (2005)  
- Set in a futuristic sci-fi world with desert environments.  
- You control a squad of elite soldiers (SpecForce) in advanced armor.  
- Features squad control and the ability to switch between team members.  
- Involves fighting against rebels and mercenaries.  

If that's not the one, could it be **""Pariah""** (2005)? It's a sci-fi shooter with desert-like levels, though it's more of a single-player FPS without squad mechanics.  

If none of these fit, do you remember if it was on **PC, PlayStation 2, or Xbox**? That could help narrow it down! Let me know, and I’ll keep searching for you.",-41,2025-03-27 12:01:48,Skullwiell

You can just trade and fight but it has quite a lot of complexity if you want to dive deep into some of the mechanics.

gaming,1jqevl6,ml6kkh8,"I played it for a while and, although I did have some fun with it, I stopped playing it altogether. I'm a competitive person so ranked was the game mode of my choice and I had two main reasons why I stopped playing:

1. The fact that there is no reserve in ranked. To this day I have no idea why this is not a thing. It makes metas with gadgets very same-y and boring since you have to make a loadout which is an all-arounder and you can't take more situational gadgets/abilities since either they will be countered by an all-around loadout or you will have a useless gadget 50% of the time (since it's situational).

2. The amount of smurfs is crazy, and the worst thing is they are not even trying to hide it. In fact, they are very proud of it. Smurfing ruins games, period. I understand that since it's a f2p game that it's very easy to make another account, but at least you can put some measures to make it harder (for example link a phone number to an account and have them check the phone number every couple of months or something - I don't know since I'm not a video game developer).",25,2025-04-03 11:21:43,lllucas58

gaming,1jqevl6,ml6hhv8,"I agree and I don’t play it anymore. My friend and I always joke that The Finals is the best game that “failed” because it felt like it needed something

In actuality, I think the ONLY thing that led to the downfall of the Finals is the premise/gamemode. If it were a true BR for example, maybe the game would have properly kept its player base or maybe a more tight arena experience. The mode it settled on was fun and innovative, constantly keeping teams moving to different points on the map to cash out, and seamlessly alternating you between offense and defense, and yet that style of play really runs its course quickly and grows tiring, especially in the tournament format. I appreciate them taking a risk, because it led to such a sick game, but I think this is to blame.

The games environmental destruction is so impressive to the point I wish all games had it (hi DK Bananza), the devs have tight tuning, movement is fast, technical, and deep, and the gunplay isn’t overshadowed by abilities. I will say, I don’t think the gunplay here is that great, and the game’s performance was fine but not amazing; however, I don’t think either of these two things made the game “fail”. 

The Finals feels like a great game released in the wrong era, or like it was just one huge realization away from being amazing. Fortnite was originally a Tower Defense vs. zombies, and then they made it into a BR and all of a sudden the arcadiness of the game could shine, and the natural issues that originate from a BR got ameliorated by building which created this perfect storm.

That said my actual dream musuo would be a Monster Hunter one, but you're playing as the monsters. Mow down newbie hunters and have the officer enemy type be veteran hunters. Not really sure what the connective tissue between combat would be though, since jumping around to different monsters doesn't lend itself well to a traditional story. Maybe something akin to like Tokyo Jungle I guess, where there has been a calamity and resources are finite and everyone is just trying to survive.",11,2025-04-20 22:35:49,Jellozz

gaming,1jwte0a,mmprwel,"Hey OP, my son is 8 now and we've been playing videogames since he were 4, here are my recommendations...

The first and most important one to have a BLAST with your son is Human fall flat: https://store.steampowered.com/app/477160/Human_Fall_Flat/

It's my son preferred game, we still play it from time to time when we find new good maps.

Not only is super fun to play it (when he was younger he could laugh just at seeing the characters walk xD) but also he'll learn to cooperate and basic physics principles.

This game can give you TENS of hours.


The second one that I think you son will love is Fling to the finish: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1054430/Fling_to_the_Finish/

It's also a super fun game where both of you must properly cooperate in order to advance; this will help him in learning to cooperate and communicate with you.

Unfortunately it's a little bit short but still it's a solid choice.


Also we love two players oriented puzzle platform games, like these:

* ibb & obb: https://store.steampowered.com/app/95400/ibb__obb/

* Toodee and Topdee: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1303950/Toodee_and_Topdee/

If you're into RPGs Cat Quest 2 is a very easy and friendly one, although it have too much text for a 5yo kid, but you can give it a try: https://store.steampowered.com/app/914710/Cat_Quest_II/

After this things gets harder; Stardew Valley is fantastic but the kid must be used to read, something a 5yo might not; Lego games are solid for children but after half of one it gets boring for the adult (at least for me) so imagine after having played maybe 3 of them; Shovel Knight have a fantastic two players mode but it'll be probably too hard for a 5yo.

I hope this helps you in bonding with him :)

**Edit**: I forgot another one that my son loved it when he was at your's age, Strikey sisters, a breakout clone with some extra mechanics, he'll get good reflexes from it: https://store.steampowered.com/app/643880/Strikey_Sisters/

**Edit  2**: And another one!! Rogue heroes: Ruins of Tasos: https://store.steampowered.com/app/787810/Rogue_Heroes_Ruins_of_Tasos/

It's a SNES Zelda clone with proper local coop support, it's not bad although it was far too easy for my taste, but of course that makes it an excellent choice for a small kid.

**Edit 3**: Once he grew a little bit and get some good reflexes and cooperative skills you can try Overcooked 2, a fantastic coop game: https://store.steampowered.com/app/728880/Overcooked_2/

The problem is that the game can get HARD, I think it's not for a 5yo (don't remember at what age we played it) but you may want to save it for later.

gaming,1jt4i3a,mlrgsen,"atleast 95% of dialogue options in games are pointless, if not more.

Even BG3 for all its varied path also has plenty of dialogue that has no real impact what you pick.

There are plenty of arguments for having dialogue choices that ""doesnt matter"" spread out over dialogue

* Realism, its not just one person monologuing but actually a conversation, you complain that there is a choice but alot of games ONLY speaks when you speak as a choice, if that is the case then yeah you need it
* Breathing room,  Rather than realism its more so a way to let people have time to think about and comprehend what they were just told, instead of again getting a long spiel of exposition, 
* Personal Agency, since you included something as broad as ""It doesnt affect what happens next"" this can include all dialogue which can shape how you see your character even if it doesnt necessarily change what happens next, i think best example comes in recent game ""Eternal Strands"" where you are trapped with your travelling group in a magic dome thing and when they look to you to say something it has things like ""x dialogue (Inspiring Hope), Y dialogue (Stop complaints), Z dialogue (appeal to adventerous spirit)"" it doesnt change stuff but i can shape easily how you see yours.
* An easy extension of WORTHWHILE uses of dialogue wheel, not every single thing you say has to be a choice of extreme good and evil, sometimes you can inquire about more information if you are curious, and again since the dialogue is often multiple choices in a conversation it makes sense to have 2 or 3 options per above to get to ""next part"" and then 1 or 2 options for more information.

Sounds to me like you want a game without dialogue options, which is fine, but i cant keep my eyes open to those long slogs of reading text for 30 minutes in JRPGs as they just talk about nothing, despite reading for fun daily, atleast with choices its gives breathing room and kinda refocusing moments.",21,2025-04-06 21:17:19,ZoulsGaming
gaming,1jt4i3a,mlrx82h,"I mean if the choice is between having no interaction or having an illusory choice, i think the illusory choice is better. Having options isn't imo just about the result, but also about making the choice itself. \*Of course\* it's better to have a real consequence and meaning for the choice, but that takes considerable dev time, depending on how much it affects the story, keeping track of branching of decisions, the extra voicelines for various outcomes, testing etc. Yeah it sucks when a game pretends your choices matter and you find out they don't, but when it's something simple just for the immersion then i'm all for it. For example i enjoyed all the 'dialogue' choices in ghost of tsushima, even when it was obvious that it doesn't matter if Jin is thinking about Yuna or his uncle when he's taking a bath etc, or when Judy in Cyberpunk asks how you like your coffee. The outcomes would be exactly the same regardless on what you choose to say, but it adds to the experience for minimal cost imo. So yeah i'd like devs to keep making two or more options even if the difference don't change anything, as long as it's clear which set of choices has actual consequences.",3,2025-04-06 22:53:55,conqeboy

gaming,1jt4i3a,mls9uqz,"well no.....

consistency is an important factor when it comes to having the immersion of player choice; meaningful or not.  
Having meaningless dialogue options helps balance out and emphasize the real choices that have an effect on the story or game.

If you slot in dialogue choices only when it is absolutely necessary, then it breaks up the immersive factor and doesn't feel as natural for supposedly having a character with choice. You become less involved with your character.",2,2025-04-07 00:11:10,djr7

After a brief camp scene where they all talk about Robo's four centuries of tireless work and the suggestion that they're all being guided by some sort of Entity, they talk about things they'd like to change with the power that time travel gives them. Lucca dismisses the idea, but there's definitely something there.

Cut to later that night. Lucca wakes up. The Time Gate music fades in, progressing beyond the two seconds we're usually limited to and into a warbling, oscillating nightmare soundscape. She wanders into a clearing to find a Time Gate. She activates it. It's RED instead of blue. Already this is incredibly unsettling.

She arrives in her house, some time in the past. And if you've been paying attention, it hits you. She's here to save her mother from being crippled in an freak domestic/industrial accident.

You can do it, but if you fail, you're punished by being forced to relive the entire thing, complete with a ghastly 16-bit scream after the smash to black.

Enemies still Look the Same, areas Look as peacefull as can be and than you die over and over again. Thats Just frustrating. But thats Not all...

Games Like Fallout Just do it better. First you fight Off roaches and Rats with a BB gun. Than you Encounter dogs, Raiders, bigger enemies with better weapons, Armor and stuff. And when you Encounter a deathclaw and only have a BB gun in your Hand you know you got No Business in that area yet.

I thought combat was good not great but it was challenging enough so I enjoyed it. I had no problem with stealth either. As long as you find grass or bushes to hide in you can be inches from someone and they won't see you. Now that doesn't always work out I get it but you can usually always spot the enemies well before they see you and I would act accordingly and find my place to hide watch their pathing and then take them out one by one.Especially once I got a bow one headshot takes him down even with a non upgraded bow. I played on default level I'm not sure if you were higher than that or not but I thought the difficulty with good for default. And if you do enjoy the game there's plenty of replayability since you can choose between quite a few allies to escape with and get different endings. plus once you figure out what you have to do and what you have to go I've seen people speed running this game very quickly so you can fly through to get the other endings with different allies once you had your fill.I'm on my second playthrough now and still enjoying it. That may get old soon but so far it hasn't. But as of now I only plan on finishing this playthrough because I still haven't finished kcd2 or a.c shadows and south of Midnight's right around the corner. But my guess is once I finish my second I will eventually go back for a third playthrough cuz it's the perfect length imo. I think the game is worth playing but I'm not saying it's some some masterpiece. But again these are just my opinions and I'm not trying to convince you otherwise with the experience that you had just my 2 cents. I always appreciate hearing someone else's point of view And although I disagree I thought you were being fair and genuine about your experience. That's a lot more than I can say for some other people who just hate simply for the fact to hate certain games. So I appreciate your honest review.,9,2025-03-31 06:25:44,BlazeGawd7
gaming,1jnvnuc,mkr9agv,"I really don't understand why you were downvoted so much. I'm about 16 hours into the game and it's SO BORING. Why do people have such low expectations for games anymore? Have we really been conditioned to accept sub-par releases? I understand not every game can be a Fallout or a Grand Theft Auto, but there have been tons of excellent games from smaller studios that blow this game out of the water.

Even big studios known for quality have given really sub-par offerings as of late (looking at you BGS with your half-baked Starfield release.. and I love BGS prior to SF).

Pretty graphics and dialogue trees don't make a game good. I need game mechanics that give meaning to what I'm doing. A well rounded story where choice is more than just ""honest/dishonest/ambiguous/givememoney"". Less janky nonsense.

I’ll agree that combat feels tough and isn’t getting easier. I get the sense the design is meant to dissuade you from trying to solo an enemy camp, but rather pick your battles. To be fair, enemies are totally willing to let you walk if you don’t confront them or move into their area, so I’ve taken to avoiding fights unless I really need to, and rolling in with buffs and throwables.
I’m running into a bug where sound will cut out that’s annoying. I’m hoping they fix that before next weekend when I’ll have more time to play.
I am getting annoyed constantly running out of inventory space. I might be trying to carry too many different weapons but I never have room for buffs and have started just immediately consuming them while clearing bases.",13,2025-03-31 05:13:19,Im_not_brian

This needs little explenation for those who have not played control. In Control there is this Ashtray maze. Its everchanging maze, but you cant get through it until specific part of story. If you enter maze, you will always return to entrance. And control on it self is eerie game, with no music, just ambient sounds. You slowly gain superpowers like flying, object throwing, mind control, shields etc.

Now, in later part of the game, you need to get through that maze, so you need to ask specific person how to do it. Im avoiding spoilers as much as i can here. Once you get to that character, you get specific item that helps you. Suddenly heavy metal starts playing (there is a reason for it in game), you can get through maze. Now starts coming into power moment. You can unleash all your powers and game throws hordes of enemies at you in ever changing trippy maze while heavy metal (songs name is Old Gods of Asgard - Take Control ) is blasting in background. Its one of the best moments in gaming tbh.

I have a hard time considering anything to be cyberpunk that doesn't involve extensive modification/augmentation of the human body through technology. It's kind of a crucial, dare I say *necessary* theme of the genre. Cyberpunk without augmentation is like a western without guns.

Also, some of those themes you listed are patently NOT things that define cyberpunk lol. Like youth rebellion - that's a YA dystopia thing, not necessarily a cyberpunk thing. Cel-shaded art also has nothing to do with the genre of cyberpunk.

The other consistent theme with cyberpunk is that people are always dehumanized in some way. In worlds like Blade Runner, you kinda see that across the board. People in general are just kind of living in squalor. In games like Deus Ex, you see it manifest mostly in the form of amplifying existing biases, i.e. active and legal segregation in society between ""augs"" and ""normals"".

Jet Set Radio has an anarchistic or ""punk"" aesthetic going on, and it is somewhat anti-corporate since you are going around spray painting graffiti, but that's about where the similarities end.

It's not about you taking over a nation (like Civilization). It's about you taking over a family, a dynasty, and ushering it though the Middle Ages. You have heirs and a court as a count, duke, king, emperor, or whoever in Europe to Northern Africa to the Middle East to India to the steppes of Asia (Mongolia and China).

The time reference is the 800's with the Norse/Viking invasions to the late 1400's with the end of the Medieval Ages into the Renaissance.

You grow your land and your power and your vassals through military might, diplomacy such as marriages and birthright, intrigue and secrets or murder, through religious power, or however you want to play.

It's a lot of fun and probably the easiest entry to get into (moreso than CK2).

[Xenoblade Chronicles X](https://youtu.be/20Hb_onhtUU?si=GC8Iz1RzrBO7YRBV) just came out. It’s very Sci Fi. It has a huge open world alien planet to explore (only one planet though). The main story isn’t the focus compared to the trilogy, but the side quests have such amazing world building it is partially forgiven.

The rest of the Xenoblade trilogy is Science Fantasy, mixing fantasy and sci fi visuals, but usually hiding the actual Sci-Fi plot for end game reveals. They have a large focus on exploration but aren’t open world, instead are open areas that are unlocked linearly. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is extremely immersive because of the characters being some of the most realistic I’ve seen written.",2,2025-04-22 14:46:54,PalpitationTop611
gaming,1k57si7,moj2sv1,"Xenoblade Chronicles X, which was stuck on the Wii U for a decade but recently got a Switch port. The premise is that Earth was destroyed in a battle between two alien empires, and it follows a group of refugees that fled Earth and crashlanded on an alien planet. It's an RPG. Camera is third person, although you can actually zoom in far enough that it becomes de facto first person.

* You're stuck on the one planet, but it's an amazing environment to explore, one of the best open worlds ever made. It has five different biomes and they're all very distinct.
* There's a main hub city that you operate out of. At first it's only home to humans, but as you progress through the game you make contact with new alien races and form alliances with them, and they start immigrating to the city, which leads to all kinds of interesting sidequests and ambient details. They're great aliens, I actually prefer them even to Mass Effect's.
* The worldbuilding is great. Every species of alien wildlife has a bestiary entry talking about its ecology. Every intelligent alien enemy has one talking about their culture. Every robot or vehicle enemy has one detailing its design specs. Also you can just pick up random junk lying around and register it in a ""Collectopedia"" that tells you a bit about it.
* There are different arms manufacturers that you can invest in and level up to get access to better gear. New alien species sometimes bring with them new technologies, so, e.g., if you form an alliance with the Nopon, you get access to their thermal weapons that do extra damage on back attacks.
* Combat emphasizes good tactics and has a lot of viable builds. It's not an action game but it feels satisfying.
* You get to pilot mechs. Transforming mechs. Later you get one that turns into a jet plane and you can fly it around the planet.

There are admittedly two significant weak points. First, the story isn't *bad*, but it's told in a strange way. It feels almost like watching episodes of an old school sci-fi show. A lot of the story is also in the sidequests. It's really important that you do the game's side content.

Second, there's one character who is, frankly, obnoxious. If you can put up with him, though, the rest of the cast are fine.",2,2025-04-23 00:45:54,Galle_

gaming,1jxulqc,mmuli3n,"just to clarify some thing  
MMO is a term that is literally just defining the player number within a session,  
MMO as a definition has no mechanics tied to it.  
Player skills and classes is more of a RPG system.

Based on what you've explained 2 games come to mind  
1. Granblue Fantasy ReLink  
\- 3rd person action RPG, short 10-20ish minute linear zones with PVE mobs and bosses.  
pick and unlock characters to level up, you can customize and grind gear for them, certain characters fulfill a role but you can customize which abilities you take which can lead you into more offensive/Tank/Support roles.  
2. Monster Hunter  
this one should be self explanatory but yea, large zones, pick a weapon, kill monster, grind loot, upgrade yourself, play with friends, 10-40(?)min sessions",10,2025-04-13 04:56:36,djr7

gaming,1jxulqc,mmtjhg2,"I liked Wayfinder a lot as well. I can't necessarily offer many games exactly like it, but here's some sort of roughly adjacent titles:

Kingdoms of Amalur is purely single-player, but I think it's very similar to Wayfinder - both in art style and in gameplay. 

Diablo 3 might be something roughly close to what you want. Out of all 4 games in the franchise, I think Diablo 3 is probably the most like Wayfinder - however, the isometric view and more single-player focus may not be your cup of tea. Grim Dawn is also capable of multiplayer, but it's very similar to Diablo, in that the dungeons aren't those 5-30 minute contained areas, and you're doing a bit more exploration and such.

I believe Dark Alliance (the DnD game from a few years back) was similar to Wayfinder (i.e. PvE in groups in multiplayer), but that game was apparently atrocious, so I don't think it will be your thing, sadly.

I hope that offers you something - admittedly, there aren't too many games exactly like Wayfinder",1,2025-04-13 00:26:13,ZXSth

gaming,1jogjep,mkrsbde,"Mass Effect 3:

For me several things should've determined a good ending.

1. Scan all keepers in the first game
2. Wrex survives encounter on Virmire
3. Kaiden survives on Virmire
4. Council saved in first game
5. Heretics destroyed in second game
6. All loyalty missions completed, all companions survive in second game
7. Collector Base destroyed
8. Wrex and Eve alive, Genophage cured
9. Samara helped
10. Geth and Quarian peace, Koris survives

Chorban's data on the keepers enables us to have some insight on the Citadel's functions, the Council being saved gives us Salarian support in the third game when we cure the Genophage, the heretics destroyed limits Reaper influence on Geth, all companions contribute something to the final battle, and the Collector Base being destroyed means we acquire the Reaper's heart in the Cerberus HQ, not its brain.

During the Reaper Destroyer part, both Jack's and Kaiden's students, plus Samara and the Asari Justicar order form a super combined biotic warp to fuck up the destroyer's armour, and momentarily disrupt the jamming, making the first Thanix missiles hit the Destroyer meaning you still have a set left.

During the final mission at a certain part, Turian and Krogan troops would act as a distraction for harbinger, and the final Thanix missiles destabilize him. if Wreav is in charge then he only sends a token force of Krogan to do the distraction with the Turians, and if you betrayed Wrex by not curing the Genophage then no Krogan are sent.

At the Catalyst you use some sort of McGuffin developed by the combined efforts of the Salarians, Quarians and Geth, made using data from Chorban's keeper scans, this McGuffin enables the Destroy ending to only target the Reapers themselves. If heretics survive then Geth are reluctant to work with organics, if Koris is dead then the Geth and Quarians don't work together on the project, and the Salarians only contribute if you saved the council in the first game.",57,2025-03-31 23:26:55,Xenozip3371Alpha

gaming,1jpam5i,mky2y5i,"RDR is definitely still a good game and the story is worth playing, but also remember it came out first and it’ll be pretty obvious they didn’t really have a plan for a prequel. Most characters aren’t mentioned at all, Arthur most notably. To me, RDR2’s story hits a lot harder knowing what I know from RDR. There’s a tension and ominous tone throughout due to the fact that if you played the first one, you already knew how RDR2 was going to end. You already knew that Arthur wasn’t going to make it and many of the others, so it adds the tension of “what happens to all these characters I now love?”

It’s kind of like Star Wars. Sure you could watch them in episodic order, but it’s pretty obvious 1-3 weren’t fully fleshed out ideas when Episode 4 got made (hell even 5 and 6 clearly weren’t fully thought out) and so the story suffers a bit that way. It’s the same here with RDR. 1 takes place after 2, but there’s a lot of stuff that happens in 2 that is never even talked about or mentioned in the first. What happened to John prior to the start of the game is left pretty vague throughout RDR and tons of detail is left out. 

This isn’t to dissuade you from playing it; you should definitely play it. But I think it’s more rewarding to play 2 after 1, and not the other way around.",6,2025-04-02 00:19:18,DejounteMurrayisGOAT

gaming,1jmq555,mkdvcjr,"Odyssey was their big one in my opinion. In terms of actually having fun with a video game, there’s no other AC I’ve had more fun with than Odyssey. It’s not about whether it’s a good AC or not, it’s just a damn fun game. The great cast of characters, the absolutely gorgeous world filled with fun side quests/stories, and variety in how you can build your Misthios, variety in the combat, the ship battles are the best they’ve ever been, boarding was always epic. Kassandra is also the best main protagonist they’ve made. She has a great sense of humor, she’s tough when she needs to be but still allows herself to be vulnerable. 

I’ve played 20 or so hours of Shadows and yeah, it’s definitely a step up from Valhalla, it’s just not as FUN as odyssey.",107,2025-03-29 17:25:06,AbundlaSticks
