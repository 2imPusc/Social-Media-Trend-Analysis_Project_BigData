food,1jtndek,mlvkllf,[removed],301,2025-04-07 15:24:44,N/A
food,1jtndek,mlvkgi2,"Dough ingredients (Baker’s %):

    •550 grams of high gluten flour (100%)
    •347 grams of filtered water (63%) 
    •15 grams of sea salt (2.7%)
    •10 grams of sugar (1.8%)
    •10 grams of barley malt (1.8%) (optional)
    •11 grams of extra virgin olive oil (2%) 
    •0.75 grams of instant dry yeast (0.1%)

Mix water (100°F) yeast, salt and sugar

Put the flour in a stand mixer bowl, set mixer to 1 and add the malt (if using). Slowly add water. Once water is incorporated add the oil and mix for 8 minutes on setting 1, the dough should just start to be getting smooth (I don’t know if it does anything but I like to gently scrape the dough off the hook a few times during this step). Alternatively hand knead for 12 minutes

Cover and let the dough rest for 15 minutes.

Do a serious of stretch and folds to incorporate air, place the dough back into the mixing bowl, cover and rest for 10-15 minutes. If the dough is smooth move on, if not do another series of stretch and folds, cover and allow to rest another 10-15 minutes. Ball and bulk rest the dough in a covered bowl for 5-11 hours.

Ferment at room temp for about 24 hours total. This will give you the flavor of a longer cold ferment but with stronger gluten. In my experience there is nothing special about fermenting in the fridge for an extended period of time, I get quicker and better results by fermenting at room temp.

After the bulk ferment, divide your dough into two equal portions (about 460 grams each). Ball the dough until it’s smooth, if you’re not getting a smooth ball try gently doing some stretch and folds to incorporate more air and try balling again. You want the dough to be smooth and tight. Place each dough ball into a lightly greased sealable container, preferably round and large enough so the dough can double in size. Place in a safe spot to finish fermenting at room temperature (24 hours total including the bulk ferment)

Find a block of low-moisture full-fat mozzarella and shred, dice or tear by hand. I use about 190-200 grams (6.87 ounces) per 16” pizza, but this should be adjusted to personal preference. Sometimes I’ll do about 80/20 mozz/provolone mix. Always get good cheese and never buy pre shredded

I also use pecorino or Parmesan, or a mix. Preferably hand shredded, about 20 grams.

Cook using your preferred method, I used an Ooni Koda 16 on low after preheating on high for 30 mins.

They're one of the most popular vendors, and for good reason: their sausage and grilled pork (which they call ""braciole"", although I have no idea whether it technically is that) are awesome.  I make sure to get one of each every year.  Not the cheapest but it's NYC and also a street fair so that's how it goes.

food,1jmqd4i,mkhbig3,"Regarding the wraps: A few months ago, I realized I'd never made a pinwheel or wrap so I looked up a few vids on YouTube and then made some for dinner. The guides I followed said after filling, roll and wrap tightly in cling film and then refrigerate for 1 hour so that everything would hold together. Even so, wben I tried cutting them into pinwheels and transferred them to my dinner plate, much of the filling fell out. I thought ""Ok, I'll just leave the others as whole wraps"" but still a considerable amount of filling out dropped out/squeezed out of the open rear end as they were being eaten.

So, my question is when you are prepping these in great volume, do you individually wrap each roll or do you have a better process - and what's the key to ensuring the filling stays put?",3,2025-03-30 06:26:15,DanielB_CANADA

3. In a mixing bowl, combine, and mix dry ingredients. 
4. Add butter and press flour into the butter until the pieces are about the size of peas. 
5. Add in green yogurt, mix until dough is hydrated and forms.
6. Let the dough rest in the fridge if the dough feels warm.
7. Optional but if you want distinct layers, do the book fold method 2-3 times. 
8. Roll out the dough and thickness should be about 3/4-1inch. (You can use flour to dust but just be sure to brush off any extra before putting them into the pan)
9. My picture shows 7 biscuits in a 10 inch cast iron pan but you can cut them evenly to 6 or 8!
10. Bake until 190-200F internal temp.",140,2025-03-29 14:20:57,bamboo_time

food,1jvjzsw,mmbhtk0,"32oz room temp cream cheese 2/3 cup sour cream 4 large eggs room temp 1 cup sugar 1 and 1/2 teaspoons vanilla 1/8th teaspoon salt

The crust is

1 stick butter melted 1 and 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs 1 tablespoon brown sugar 1 and 1/2 tablespoons sugar

Pre heat oven to 325.

Mix all crust ingredients together and layer them into the bottom and sides of your spring pan.

If you have a stand mixer combining the cheesecake ingredients will be easier. Mix the cream cheese until smooth, then add the sugar and mix again.

After that add the salt, vanilla and sour cream. Then finally the eggs. I’d add them one at a time, and don’t beat the batter too much, you really don’t want a lot of air added to the mix.

I baked this one for about 55 minutes and then let it set for about 4 hours.

The strawberry topping is one crate of fresh copped strawberries, about a half cup of water, and some lemon juice; cooked down in a pot. I added, if I had to guess, like half cup sugar (I kind of eye balled that one). Then in a bowl with another about half cup of water I mixed in a few spoon fulls of corn starch, and then added that mixture to the pot. I let it cook down until it thickened up to how I wanted it.

The topping was kind of an afterthought :)

Hopefully I this is helpful

I imagine it did but I can't imagine what it was like. Chaat masala by itself is so flavorful, how would the pork shoulder stand against it? I mean, pork shoulder is great but a vastly more subtle flavor even with the orange and cumin seasoning. And saffron chicken salad is a taste I have no experience in, except that saffron is again, a very innocuous flavor.

It looks amazing but I fear I would have to have this exact meal to understand how it tasted! Maybe one day I will get lucky (because in no way can I cook like that!!). Thank you for the wonderful photos!",2,2025-03-30 22:28:12,wormcast

https://youtu.be/imJS5swk0Vc

Holy moly is this thing moist! I am happy to report that I think this might be the best carrot cake I’ve had! I followed recipe to the T. Here’s the recipe from the video:

⸻

Carrot Cake

Preheat Oven: 350°F (175°C)

Ingredients

Dry Ingredients:
	•	2 cups (260g) all-purpose flour
	•	2 tsp baking soda
	•	½ tsp fine sea salt
	•	1½ tsp ground cinnamon

Wet Ingredients:
	•	1½ cup vegetable oil
	•	1 cup (200g) granulated sugar
	•	1 cup (190g) brown sugar (I used light)
	•	1 tsp vanilla extract
	•	4 large eggs (room temperature)

Mix-ins:
	•	3 cups (300g) grated carrots
	•	1 cup chopped pecans
	•	½ cup raisins

⸻

Instructions
	1.	Prep Oven: Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9” round cake pans.
	2.	Mix Dry: In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.
	3.	Mix Wet: In another bowl, whisk together oil, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla. Add eggs one at a time, whisking after each.
	4.	Combine: Add the wet mixture to the dry ingredients. Stir until just combined.
	5.	Add Mix-ins: Fold in grated carrots, chopped pecans, and raisins.
	6.	Bake: Divide batter evenly into the prepared pans. Bake for 35 to 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
	7.	Cool: Let cakes cool in pans for 10 mins, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely (at least 15 mins).

⸻

Frosting

Ingredients:
	•	8 oz cream cheese (room temperature)
	•	2 tsp corn starch
	•	1¼ cup (140g) powdered sugar
	•	⅓ cup (80ml) heavy cream
	•	½ cup chopped pecans (for topping)

Instructions:
	1.	Beat cream cheese, corn starch, powdered sugar, and heavy cream until smooth and fluffy.
	2.	Frost the first cake layer, stack the second layer on top, and finish frosting.
	3.	Sprinkle chopped pecans over the top as a garnish.",13,2025-04-19 19:58:16,pkragthorpe

food,1jj7yxr,mjlsaxz,"I prefer to caramelize the mirepoix, deglaze with red wine, then blend and strain. Use that liquid to deglaze after cooking the beef. You really want to get a good browning on the beef to bring out the right flavors and the mirepoix red wine reduction will bring in the extra layers of flavor without the extra fiber and texture of the vegetables.

Another good step is when your Bolognese is finished take a hefty portion of the meat and a bit of the sauce and blend it before putting it back in. You can rinse the blender with a bit of red wine and add that to the sauce so as not to waste any. 

Beef stock or beef marrow bone broth can be substituted for the red wine if you prefer.",22,2025-03-25 04:29:06,Medullan

food,1juk1y5,mm5qrf4,"Sooo, no recipe then? :(  I'm mostly interested in a good recipe for a marinara, and yours looks great! I don't see any Italian parsley. What are your opinions on that? It seems like something you would've experimented with. Skim or whole mozz (I'm assuming here)? What types of bread have you tried, and which do you prefer? I don't see any garlic, but maybe it's just under all the cheese. What types are you using? I'll show you mine the hopes that you'll show us yours.

1.5 C shredded part skim mozzarella or Monterey jack  

Chopped Italian Parsley - Honestly never weighed this, but when mixed it should look like there will be a couple of pieces every  1""x1"", but really a person preference.  

1.5 Tbsp store bought minced garlic (plus/minus .5 Tsp depending on preference)  

1.5 Tbsp salted butter  

1.5 Tbsp Mayo  

1 tsp Cholula (hot sauce optional)  


Using the back end of a spoon, or other similar tool, mix until combined and it looks like a spread/paste. This can then be refrigerated, but needs to be soft enough to spread easily onto the bread. Spread a layer onto the bread. The thickness is up to you, but I find it can depend on the thickness of the bread. I like a thinner layer in general. Cook in the oven at 380F for 10-12 minutes. I prefer the oven to an air fryer, but air frying is generally 3-4 mins at 360. My local Whole Foods sells a croissant bread, which of course the best bread I have tried.

I’ve always wondered about the process of how you make your recipes. Is there a lot of trial and error with getting the correct ingredient amounts?

Hello there I'm Chef John from Fooooood Wishes.com wiiiith


AN AMA! That's right, we're answering questions on reddit! 




Anyway...




I have a friend trying to impress a girl with some cooking but he says you have too many videos for him to sift through. What's the #1 recipe you have for winning a second date?",55,2025-03-26 18:14:31,DarkSideOfBlack

food,1jkck6n,mjwmfz4,"Chef John! - 

What a chance to reach out to someone that's _actually_ influenced me and my life in tremendous ways. I'm a middle aged man, and have been a ""home cook"" for 12 years. My friends think of me as some chef (I'm -so- not). The reality is, I just watch your videos (and some others), find commonalities, and kind of figure it out from there. I use you as a guide, not an absolute, and that's been great. You've enabled me to bring so much joy to not only myself, but the people who grace me with their presence and allow me to cook for them in my home.  

I -really- appreciate how you teach techniques, and encourage people to experiment. I also DEEPLY value that the only thing that's changed over the 12+ years I've been watching is that the video quality and general editing has gotten better. No fancy and silly animations or sound effects, no skits, no celebrities showing up, no ""omgggggggg sooo good"" reaction faces, and no ""I rated the top 10 _____"" nonsense. Just food. Just lessons. Just the info we so deeply want without the noise trying to be ""viral"". I sincerely believe the reason your channel is one I'll always come back to is because you're true, honest, and you don't waiver. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT.

**Now, a question :**

It seems you do very little ""baking"" as part of your repertoire. I know cooking is kind of like art, and baking more of a science. Would you ever consider bringing more ""baking"" type things into your videos? Things like a chicken pot pie crust, or Yorkshire puddings, or working with philo and puff pasty? I know you touch on it a bit, but would you be willing to explore that more? And, by extension, are there some other less talked about topics you'd really like to get into in the coming year(s)?

Thank you again for everything you're doing. It's a great service to us all, and it's enabled me to live a happier, healthier, and far more enjoyable life with food.",63,2025-03-26 21:28:24,ilovedillpickles

Your videos are always on topic and clearly explain what to do and not to do. Every time I get a notification of a new video, my day is much improved.

My favorites of yours are your homemade marinara and your fresh garden tomato sauce (those are just the top favorites; I have many others). The latter will be used to make tonight's dinner, in fact! I grow so many tomatoes and that recipe is perfection. I would never have thought of that combo of flavors but I love them so much.

food,1jw8xdk,mmgrcx5,But I thought carbonara only comes from the Mountains of Carbone? Otherwise it’s just sparkling pasta with Parmesan.,91,2025-04-10 22:06:54,FMLwtfDoID
food,1jw8xdk,mmgiz2b,"Quick notes:

\- Had some sausage to kill off, some garlic, lemons, parm, eggs - lets try something lol

\- Timing this meal can turn it into a 25min cook time - it's a matter of juggling the prep, boiling water, starting the pasta, begin frying, finish pasta as the frying completes.

\- 4 eggs, about 200g of diced sausage, a good handful of parm, half to a full lemon's of grated rind (go lighter, it's not exactly subtle and can become a bit bitter), 2 cloves of minced garlic, and a knob of butter. I also tacked in a bit of thyme and some smoked paprika for colour.

\- Whipped the eggs with grated parm, added the thyme and a bit of paprika.

\- Fired off on the sausage, lightly frying it until browning a bit, throw in garlic, fry together.

\- Cooked the pasta goes into the pan, with a bit of pasta water, along with the whipped egg, parm, over a low heat. As the bit of pasta water reduces through the egg, I added a knob of butter.

\- Let it all come together in the pan, stirring gently but constantly as to not let the egg cook like scramble, but reduce to a creamy texture.

\- Serve immediately. To taste, a dash of pepper, and a little squeeze of fresh lemon juice.

Result: after eating it, it's fine, but ya, half a lemon rind, and only one garlic clove. Different sausage, too. Could have been better,",23,2025-04-10 21:22:11,crimsontape

I spent a few hours last weekend peeling, mincing and freezing garlic. Had company and help to keep it fun :)

We started with app. 6,5 kg (over 14 lbs) of fresh farmer's market garlic and we still have a bunch left over.

Didn't use any special hacks for peeling, the garlic was lovely and peeled easily.

We ended up with around 7 zip lock bags of minced garlic, scored them with wooden skewers and froze them. We also froze 1 bag with whole cloves for occassions when that's more useful.

food,1jj80gb,mjmr1ye,"Recipe: 

Ingredients; For the dough: Harina P.A.N - Wheat flour - a teaspoon of salt- a touch of sugar (optional), warm water

- Oil for frying

- for the filling: (you can use the filling of your choice, ham and cheese, chicken ground or shredded beef, pork, ground or shredded meat)

- I used; - 500 grs. Chicken breast,  onion, paprika, garlic, salt and pepper/ Ham and grated yellow cheese

-Preparing the filling; In a pot, add oil or butter and sauté the garlic, onion, and paprika.

Add the chicken and cook until its ready. 

-Prepare the dough; Mix ingredients: In a large bowl, mix the Harina P.A.N, Wheat flour, salt, and warm water.  Knead until you have a smooth and manageable dough.

-Divide the dough: Form balls the size of a golf ball.

Assemble the empanadas: Roll out: With a rolling pin, roll each ball between two sheets of wax paper until it's about 0.5 cm thick. Fill: Place a tablespoon of filling in the center of each dough circle
Seal: Fold the dough in half and press the edges to seal. You can use a fork to create a design on the edges.
Fry: In a deep skillet, heat enough oil to cover the empanadas. Fry the empanadas until golden and crispy, about 3-4 minutes on each side.

-Remove the empanadas and place them on paper towels to absorb excess oil. Now enjoy this delight!!",8,2025-03-25 10:28:37,AnnSquirt69
