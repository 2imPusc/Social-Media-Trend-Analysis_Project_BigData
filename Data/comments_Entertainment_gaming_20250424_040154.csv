gaming,1jn8l8k,mkhy3rp,"The core of the immersive sim genre is systems-based interaction with the environment that creates emergent gameplay.

My go-to example these days would actually be the Hitman World of Assassination trilogy. Those games operate on a fairly tight internal logic. If you're disguised as a mechanic, you're allowed to mess with electronics. If you put rat poison in a drink, anyone who drinks it will go running somewhere to vomit. Your interactions with the environment have systematic, predictable effects, which allows you to plan ahead and choose to approach levels in your own way.

Compare this to set piece design, like Half-Life. Half-Life is full of pre-scripted special case ""set pieces"" that happen once and then never again. There is a point in the story, for example, where soldiers hear you crawling through a vent and take shots at it, creating holes that let little rays of light through. In an immersive sim, this kind of thing is not allowed. It's a deviation from the rules of the game and that's not fair to the player.",3,2025-03-30 10:32:09,Galle_

gaming,1jn8l8k,mkhrybn,"There is no universally accepted definition -- both Prey (2016 - the one that takes place on Talos I and where you face the mimics) and The Long Dark are considered Immersive Sims, but the protagonist of Prey never needs to worry about their hunger, thirst or exhaustion, while the protagonist of The Long Dark must keep track of those factors all the time.

It's similar to the problem of ""define RPG"" -- some players insist that RPGs must have character statistics (such as Str, Dex, Con, Int, Chr), while others say ""As long as you can choose to be good or evil in meaningful way, it's an RPG"". So Diablo series gets labeled RPG, despite you having no choice in a single quest, while I consider Horizon Zero Dawn more RPG'ish than Diablo, because you get to choose who lives or dies.",5,2025-03-30 09:26:17,AlcatorSK

Reaper IFF for ME2

Priority: Tuchanka for ME3

These aren't hard lock off points, but you will suffer unnecessary losses if you do them without certain loyalty missions or without enough experience/reputation. And I mean like, seriously bad losses that will affect your whole playthrough.

Also, in the final ME2 mission (you'll know it when you get there) just look on the wiki to find who the best people are for various tasks (again you'll know when you get there) for the same reason. It's worth a little metagaming to avoid fucking up some of the best parts of ME3.

gaming,1jm59th,mk95yoy,"Personally I tend to enjoy the setting of Assassin's Creed games more than even the gameplay or story. The environments that you can roam in is pretty neat and the AC team will include a lot of real world information regarding a lot of the locations that you can visit in game. So, if it were me picking a game, I would pick the setting that most interests me. Enjoy the Renaissance? Go with the Ezio trilogy. These were the watershed games for the series in terms of assassination gameplay (and in terms of story, imo). Do you have a fascination with Vikings? Valhalla might be your game. Interested in the American revolution? AC III is your bet. AC Unity and Syndicate are fun, if you want to tromp around Paris and London, respectively. If you like Greek or Egyptian mythology, then Odyssey or Origins might be your thing. The newest, Shadows, has been fun so far as a self admitted Japanophile.



AC IV Black Flag is probably the weakest of the games in terms of having a interesting setting but the gameplay very much makes up for it. I can't really recommend AC I.

From there, you can either move back to the other 2D games, though I would only recommend Platinum, HeartGold, or SoulSilver, or you can move forward to the 3D games, so it's probably the best starting point for a new player.

None of them are hard in any way. The only thing that's changed is how much you would have to grind, which was reduced in later generations.

These tools might rely on you being on a dev system of some kind, or may be turned off entirely.

Many PC games with a console you can pass commands to have the console even turned off by default. (The user might have to change a cfg file or something)

It feels like cheat codes were more common in console games in past years.

I think there’s still a spirit in pc gaming, perhaps even an expectation, that users may be more inclined to tinker with, mod, or otherwise interface with the game in different ways due to the more versatile pc environment.

There’s also the fact games are generally easier now (at least to play, not necessarily to master) so there’s less of a demand maybe?

Consoles, focused on fair online play and a consistent experience, keep their playgrounds locked down tight, making cheats much rarer.",4,2025-03-25 17:46:26,printerNinja

gaming,1jjojo0,mjoths9,"Console games have to go through an approval process by the platform vendor. One thing that can get your game’s build rejected is for the vendor to find a crash. Taking hidden features out of a game drastically reduces the ways that a build can fail certification.

Basically it’s probably really expensive to leave it in because of all the testing and QA it needs to get. For a PC, nobody stands in the way. Developers can leave that stuff in and say “use at your own risk, unsupported.”",2,2025-03-25 17:26:49,Troldann
gaming,1jjojo0,mjowq4a,"If by frequently you mean, currently, they don’t. If you mean frequently as in decades ago, have you never even heard of the konami code? Hitting into the late 90s and early to mid 2000s, it wasn’t uncommon for console games to include entire dedicated cheat menus, including tony hawk’s pro skater, guitar hero, lego star wars, etc.

It’s important to point out that ‘cheat codes’ were always originally just dev tools that were left in the game. Like, if your video game is hard, but you need to get through it to test later parts of the game, you include god mode cheats, or mario warp pipes, etc. 

Sometimes, leaving cheats in was just due to laziness. Other times, it was a money-making strategy. Specifically, publishers used to make a _lot_ of money selling strategy guides. There were official tips and tricks magazines like nintendo power, and infamously, the nintendo support hotline where you were charged by the minute to ask for help on whatever level you were stuck on.

The internet largely killed cheat codes as a way to make money, on both consoles and pc gaming. Players now openly share advice with each other, so charging an extra fee for a guidebook doesn’t gatekeep secrets the way it used to.

You might just be thinking of one certain company’s offerings, like, say, Elder Scrolls and Fallout, which still leave the dev consoles in their shipped games on pc, but said consoles are inaccessible normally on console. And that’s because they’re not _meant_ for the player. They’re dev tools. And the games are developed on pcs, most of the testing will be done on pcs, and they’ll just be ported to consoles afterward. The console is left untouched in the pc version because that’s what would require the least amount of work. And that’s one reason why the console can’t be used on an xbox - they’d have to do _more_ work to enable a virtual keyboard and special ui so that the console could be typed into with a controller.

I’m not 100% on this but compliance testing also probably plays a role. See, console manufacturers have a list of requirements that developers are supposed to meet in order to release a game. Things like, make sure something’s moving on your loading screen so players know the game isn’t crashing, or those autosave icons to warn players not to pull the plug while the system is writing to disk. Another one of those requirements, obviously, is that your game shouldn’t cause overheating or otherwise permanent damage to a customer’s system. And if you give a player the dev tools and allow them to spawn in a thousand thomas the tank engine dragons at once? You can light your system on fire. But the pc market is unregulated, so Bethesda can leave that shit in on the pc version and give players the option to melt their cpus if they feel like it.",2,2025-03-25 17:42:10,MistahBoweh

You know, the menus you always see where you have multiple tabs you cycle through with the shoulder buttons for gear, weapons, options, maybe even throw the map in there.  Spider-Man, Final Fantasy XVI, modern Assassin’s Creed, a few examples.

I find those to be the most boring, artistically bankrupt menus I’ve ever had the misfortune to use.  And that’s BEFORE I start bitching about the slow ass cursor some of these games insist on using.  Sometimes they do something cool, like FFXVI or AC Origins having your character frozen in place in the menu.  But most of the time they’re boring, and also weirdly unintuitive to move through.

Give me a real PS2 or PS3 chunky menu design any day of the week.  They don’t all have to be out of this world like Persona, but like Kingdom Hearts, Final Fantasy X, Yakuza 0/Kiwami, these all have excellent menus without being as awful to look at.",3,2025-04-14 02:19:31,Sonic10122

Basically “Honey I Shrunk The Kids” where you are a kid shrunk down in a garden and have to fight insects to survive.

But on survival, crafting, weapons and armour, fighting bugs, bosses and robots, building a giant base (optional, but great fun).

Great story, excellent exploration, decent progression and extensive NG+ material making me replay again and again and again (you’ve got to get to NG+4 to unlock everything) never once did I find it repetitive, boring, too easy or too difficult. The bosses were hard, but my skills and weapons kept improving, I died a lot but I took it as a challenge and went back and fought again and again to get it done and I did eventually.

I platinumed it easily and carried on going, that’s practically unheard of for me, usually that’s when I have had enough. As an adult with little time to spare, this was easy to pick up and put down with small amounts of time or long runs early in the morning before I had to get out and do stuff, this absorbed me for a long while and I will definitely be going back again and again.

The multiplayer is great too, just have multiple people running around doing their own thing or you all gang up and run through parts of the storyline together. 

I’ve spent a long time on it, with my partner building and farming for materials whilst I go out and kill stuff. Farming insect parts to build better weapons and armour for us both, so we can go do parts of the storyline.",1,2025-04-14 05:43:32,uk_com_arch

gaming,1jnn1lo,mklbl7n,"At their core, JRPGs are about recreating the 'group of friends on an adventure' vibe of a shonen manga.  They're about railroaded experiences with prescribed plots.

There are lots of JRPGs where the game will allow you to make superficial world-building decisions, like how the endgame of Chrono Trigger has a bunch of side quests that influence the endings you get, but there aren't really JRPGs that do the western RPG thing you'd get from a game like Baldur's Gate 3 because that's not what JRPGs are for.

The closest you'd get is probably Atlus's MegaTen games.  Those usually have a branch in the middle that lets you change the path you're on.  But that's less of a ""choices matter"" and more of a ""choose which preset linear path you want to experience"".",16,2025-03-30 22:20:01,funkme1ster

The idea of choices matter is pretty antithetical to JRPGs because they are almost universally  trying to specificall create a shonen-style friend group adventure and are by design very linear experiences. Even when JRPGs do have choices like the recently re-released Xenoblade X or Metaphor, they are usually self-contained and rarely affect the greater story as a whole.

Basically, JRPGs almost by definition have a set story and you're just along for the ride in 99% of cases. Even games like Triangle Strategy or Fire Emblem with a little more freedom are nowhere close to traditional Western RPGs when it comes to choices.

The whole choices matter thing is really a staple Western RPGs and specifically CRPGs like Baldur's Gate and immersive sims like Dues Ex and Vampire the Masquerade.

gaming,1k5it5m,mokpewp,"now that ive played some of it, i see why they called it a remaster. it looks amazing but a lot of the outdated stuff is still there.   
  
no dual-wielding, the combat is just...there, almost exactly as it was all those years ago with some little flourishes added, the magic and favorites system is also abysmal. it looks better than skyrim but you get none of the modern gameplay updates youd see in a remake. i know they said the core of the game was unchanged but i really thought they would at least go back and at least add some of the things skyrim improved. being a mage kinda sucks again and you only have one radial wheel  with a small amount of slots for favorites. switching skills is either done through that or through the menu. best way to describe it is that its like an insanely modded oblivion. Calling it a remaster was smart honestly. they wouldve been heavily criticized if it had the remake title once people got their hands on it.

Oblivion is one of my favorite games ever i just thought they would do a bit more to help with its age and they didnt besides some basic things like sprinting, QOL, and visuals. its probably the best remaster ever though, i think they shouldve went the whole mile and we couldve gotten bigger improvements to gameplay and combat especially.

There couldn't be a ""Core"" audience with Dragon Age, with Core Expectations, because each entry was so disjointed.

Mass Effect in comparison kept a specific tone and gameplay style that was consistent throughout the trilogy, you would always know what you were getting into when you picked up a Mass Effect game. EA would have likely found it easier to market Mass Effect to a wider audience because of that fact. Rather than split the marketing between different subsectors of the fanbase that came into the franchise from different entry points that greatly differed from each other. Always shuffling the cards in terms of gameplay, would likely also cause executives to lose confidence in the success of a new Dragon Age entry, because each time you're doing something new and experimental rather than build on top of a mold that reliably worked before.",14,2025-04-17 15:55:16,Arizona_Ranger_JPG

The game's locations have a gameplay bent to each one. Vatican is where you set everything up. It's more clandestine and stealthy. You spend a lot of time learning the stealth bits and getting all your exposition.

Then Gizeh is much more sprawling. You spend more time around nazis and are free-er to bring them the hurt in a variety of ways.

Sukothai mixes it up with fascists in the jungle. And to be honest, Sukothai's boat transportation is the worse thing about the whole game, but the pockets of playable terrain are fun. I found that you can get around faster by just power sprinting underwater.

The best graphics I can think of is Cyberpunk 2077 with max settings, path tracing, etc.. The most recent ""thing"" that makes graphics seem ""next-gen"" is ray tracing. At first, I didn't know what the big deal with it was, but actually playing games that make use of it, it's clear now. The main thing that looks so much better with ray tracing is reflections (and to a lesser extent, lighting). Anything that is supposed to cast reflections does so, and reflects much more accurately than rasterized reflections. It's cool in Cyberpunk for instance to be seated at a random food stall, look down at the dirty glass table, and see a reflection of the skyscraper behind me. Or see every little thing reflected accurately in a puddle on the street.

Of course, a lot of what makes graphics look better these days isn't necessarily the game itself but what you're playing it on. An OLED TV with HDR, 4k and support for at least 120 FPS and a powerful PC/system running it will make a lot of things look way better than a little 1080p TV from 10 years ago or an LCD monitor with a 60hz refresh rate with an outdated PC or console running the game.

All that said, I think a lot of the mind-blowing ""wow factor"" innovation is actually in VR, but VR hasn't really taken off with people (I personally think it's awesome but I have to be in the mood to play it which is rare these days).",1,2025-04-22 14:39:54,EggNeckSupreme

Other than that is it just a gaming club to have fun or if its a serious club trying to help kids go pro? Might want to read up the path of going pro and how to support the path by streamlining it. 

Workshops could help if you are able to get business experts like pros, managers, etc to hold speeches and information days.

Other than that you could host open tournaments in different esports titles and get some smaller sponsors for your school, etc.

There are ways to summon armor and shields around your character. There are shouts that manifest your character's powsr outward like an ethereal dragonhide shell. It's the first thing coming to mind.

Warframe has a lot of these two.

Rhino can harden its outer surface into a crazy durable alloy.

Revenant can create layered defenses able to shrug off a number of hits.

A lot of warframes have damage reduction effects too, like Mesa (who becomes basically bulletproof) or Zephyr (who uses wind currents around itself to redirect incoming projectiles) or Gauss (using kinetics and thermodynamics to absorb incoming hits harmlessly).",1,2025-04-06 11:02:46,Pedrosian96

gaming,1jr8mb7,mlcp0dh,"Server-side checking and not sending information that's not required.

It's all you can do.

And it's usually already implemented, but same games are dumb and 20 years behind.

If you can't trust the data coming from the client, you have to process everything server-side and NOT supply the client with anything they don't need to display the game.

But that still leaves things like ""wallhacks"" and ""aimhacks"" because sometimes you have to send data on models that are JUST ABOUT to appear around corners to clients so they can draw them in time, and then clients can see data of anyone near a visible edge, even if they haven't walked around the corner yet.

And obviously an aimhack is just someone getting a player's position on screen and literally pointing the mouse at it, that's all it is.

You can implement limits on what you think a human is capable of, e.g. if someone aims unreasonably fast, but that just means that they sit under those limits and are still faster than the majority of players out there.

But if you can't control the client, you can only guarantee that what the server does is valid, and thus you end up in a position where the server's data can't filter down to the client.

Now you could do things like send the positions of a thousand models to every corner all the time, to pre-cache models for appearance, but at some point you still have to tell the client ""don't draw all these, only draw this one"" and at that point, wallhacks and aimhacks come back again.

It's why client-side detection is the only reasonable way in something like an FPS.  You can't trust ANY data from the client unless your software is there and can see everything that the client is doing (and even then you don't see EVERYTHING the client is doing... the anti-cheat could be inside a virtual machine and not know about it).  Even if you ask the client for a screenshot, it's just going to hide the cheat elements, take a screenshot, and send that, so you won't see the cheats.

There is no simple way around it, no amount of fancy tech can combat it, and nobody has yet come up with a way that can't be defeated.  If a computer can see the things that it needs to draw, and it can tell if they are an enemy or not, then it can point the crosshair at it and click fire.

gaming,1jjbjm5,mjm10mb,"I'd forgo Armageddon if I could only choose 2. It's not that Armageddon is bad. The story/konquest mode is decent enough, and it features the entire MK roster, which is neat. I do not care for its ""create a fatality"" system that it uses. It's clunky, repetitive, and really takes away character identity. Deadly Alliance and Deception are really decent for their time. Fun rosters with what were at the time new characters. The story is solid in both. Deception has a really good konquest mode that today holds up very well, in my opinion. 

However, I feel you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you never pick up Shaolin Monks. It's a game I'm very sad they never expanded upon or gave a sequel to. It's MK Mythologies: Sub Zero and MK Special Forces done right. It's hands down one of my favorite MK titles to date. And 100x more fun Co-op with a friend.

gaming,1k4xei4,mof745k,"The issue with extraction shooters is that it’s already a very niche genre. Then you have a company that wants to make one, ok great. But they want to it to appeal to as many people as they can, they want it to the be one that breaks it out to more people. How do they do this?

They try to make it a more casual experience, well when they do this it pulls the experience away from the actual extraction shooter player base. Look at all the failed ones, Cycle frontier, cod DMZ, Ubisoft’s canceled division extraction game. 

All of these tried to make it more appealing to pull in more people. Which made them lose any value in really why your looting anything, the pvp in them didn’t feel natural. Extracting with loot just turned it into money to really do fuck all with. It wasn’t used for anything. 

Extraction shooters like Tarkov, and hunt showdown succeed because they do exactly what they are made for. Tarkov is about the loot and customization, every single piece of loot in Tarkov has a use, for crafting, guns armor, hideout etc. 

Hunt showdown isn’t about loot or gear, it’s about bounties, but you still loose your hunter on death which accumulated specific perks the more you play with them and longer they survive. 

The economies can be fixed with just some sort of finance guy on the team to guide it in the right direction if they want to use a flea market type deal. 

Extraction shooters at their core is pvp, it’s niche, they aren’t going to pull everyone in. Developers need to understand that, and harness the player base of the that genre and make something for them, not for everyone because it already isn’t for everyone when you see people go “omg another extraction shooter”",2,2025-04-22 12:44:08,micheal213

Hunt Showdown doesnt have a real economy, which is nice. You still need to save up money to buy your guns, but there's no trading, so its all in check.

Dark and Darker inflation is insane. Its an open economy with an auction house.

Tarkov made a Pve mode for people that want to play it and as after like a 3 weeks the economy was already insanely inflated. Something that would cost like 60k on the PvP server was almost 1mil roubles on the Pve server. 

There’s so much less risk in playing the Pve server there’s more and more and more items extracted. People make even more money so the value of the roubles decreases and everything then costs millions of roubles.

The realism ends up taking parts of other less realistic games that streamline things and make them entertaining as a concept. With Bodycam it's a team v team tactical shooter, but you don't really get stats. When you get a kill nothing shows up on your screen to show that, which in an RPG or RP setting sounds amazing, but the entire game is based around being a tac shooter that is inherently competitive.

gaming,1k0d9uu,mnddy1q,"Probably a tech demo, or at least, someone playing around with the engine until they got enough to produce a minimum viable product for a show reel. They cram a lot of really good looking assets, effects, filters, movement animation, photorealistic textures, all to make a REALLY good looking video...

Not for YOU, for developers. They make these things to show off their engine; How the lighting works, how textures react to lighting, how you can give a flat texture the illusion of a shadow, or the particle effects falling from the ceiling. They're all meant to show the impressiveness of the technology to that someone ELSE will buy the license to use that engine, and then make their own really cool photorealistic game.

The thing is... that's hard... And it's taxing on most people's  hardware. Most people are still on PS4 and 5 year old PCs. These engines are being made on the top PCs that aren't even available for customer use yet. And even if they buy the engine today, they're not going to have a game out for that engine for years. Game Engine is usually a 'first round' kinda thing you figure out.

Not to mention, photo realistic games are hard to make... Really; they're hard to finish. A cartoony pokemon jiggles weirdly and loads in the wrong texture, you might not think much of it. But if you're looking at a photorealistic face and the lips start animating at 400% top speed, you're going to notice. 

If ANYTHING doesn't react the way you expect in a game, the immersion is broken. Half Life Alyx was SO good because EVERYTHING reacted the way 'you expected'. You pick up a beer bottle and the liquid inside gravitates toward the bottom. You pick up a marker and write on a window cause you just CAN. You can search shelves by sweeping your arm across the shelf to move things away while being shot at enemies. If ANY of these things did not interact in the realistic  world it's presenting, the entire illusion is ruined. Sure ""Thats how game work, duh"" But imagine seeing a glass bottle in a shooter  game... You shoot it, you want it to explode into a flurry of glass and liquid... imagine seeing a black gunshot texture and the bottle doesn't move at all... That would ruin  the fun of bottle shooting!

But all those tiny realistic details take time to program, to test, to animate. So, when the PS6 and Switch'a'three come out, we'll probably start seeing more things like that.",1,2025-04-16 07:16:55,Too_Tall_64

gaming,1jyawe9,mmwyocx,"Linearity can refer to various aspects of design. 

GTA5: open world level design. But mostly linear narrative design. Spider-man also fits into this. 

Dishonored: Not open world, but its level design IS non-linear. The narrative is also semi-nonlinear, but not by much. 

Disco Elysium: I would say its open world - not the way GTA is in scale but in that the world is freely explorable. But the narrative is VERY non linear. 


I would very much consider Majoras Mask to be fairly open world. Not seamlessly, there are loading screens to move through, and you have a general path through the world. It doesnt reach BotW level open-ness, but it is not linear in the way that, say, Uncharted is. Uncharted is fully linear in narrative AND level design. 

So when you say a game is linear, the question you should ask is if you mean in regards to its level design, or its narrative design. Some games fit outside of these two terms, as well.

There are many sub-stories that can occur along the way as you wander here or there. Some of these can take some time to get through so the overall campaign get put to the side.

gaming,1jyawe9,mmx0bxo,"I think it's two different things. Open world describes the level of freedom of exploration a player has in the space and how much players are rewarded for going off the most obvious path. Some games are technically open world, but don't include any areas that aren't immediately tied to main story beats so there's no reason to ever stray or backtrack.

Linearity is a function of story beats, choice outcomes, and implicit replayability. How many different choices can be made to affect the world? Does each side quest give me many ways to complete it?

For instance, Far Cry is an open world game. The player is allowed to go anywhere at any time (mostly) and is rewarded for exploration. However, with the exception of a few additional endings that really don't involve that much player agency, the stories all end up mostly at the same place in the end. Most of them are fairly linear, in other words.

Many non-linear games are open world, but I don't think it is necessary. Linearity is more about how many different choices can be made to result in as many different outcomes as possible. The game could be mostly on rails as long as there are a lot of branching paths. However, if choice is a priority for the game design many times the choice of where to go is also included in that.",2,2025-04-13 16:19:41,Rockerika

My controversial opinion?

Minerva's Den DLC is the Best Game in the series",15,2025-04-10 22:12:26,Kataratz
gaming,1jwa8wj,mmgtjwp,"Yes it's a great game.

It does some things much better than the original, however the overall story is a bit of a mess. There was a rewrite/cut in development and it's a bit obvious. Tenenbaum disappears from the story completely after the intro, and the villain/ending aren't even close to as good as 1.

In defense of Bioshock 2's story, I cared about Eleanor, while there was nothing to care about or connect to with your main character in 1. That's on purpose, your character is a 'blank slate' following programming in 1, in a meta commentary on how players engage with games. So 1 is a better story, but you aren't invested in the player character, by design.

Also the moral choices in 2 are better than 1. Bioshock 1s ""Murder little girls or don't"" is an example of stupid moral choices in games, where there's no actual nuance or thought in the decision. Bioshock 2 lets you come to your own judgement about whether deeply flawed people who are also still victims, deserve to live.

Bioshock 2 has much better level design and exploration. 1 is very linear simple and boxy when you go back to it. The AI and combat is 2 are WAY better. Again, go back and compare if you haven't played then in a while, because in 1 enemies would stand around shooting at walls and walking into traps.

Fighting the first Big Daddy in Bioshock is a cool fight and a big deal. But after that combat breaks pretty quickly and it's not hard or interesting. Bioshock 2 has a number of interesting boss fights, in addition to having you defend areas by setting up traps and making you use a bunch of resources strategically.",8,2025-04-10 22:19:10,Irish_Whiskey

Things it does worse, in some cases much worse: character development, world building, environmental story telling, ambiance, plot, enemy design, music, tension building and general writing.

A while ago I was interested in trying out games like Eiyuden Hundred Heroes and Sea of Stars, since I do love me some indie pixel RPGs. ...but then I saw that both of these games have upcoming DLC, so I decided to wait. I have plenty of other games on my backlog that are fully complete.

I will say the Borderlands series is one exception to this, once the DLC comes out I basically completely stop playing because of the way their leveling system works. DLCs in Borderlands historically also increase the level cap, which means all my gear I spent so much time grinding is useless in a level or two and I have to go back and grind it all again?

How about Street Fighter, that popularized Arcades and the fighting game genre, or Mortal Kombat which inspired gaming censorship laws?

The main thing is input lag. TVs and wireless controllers have more input lag compared to their counterparts.

But I'm aware that in a lot of the implementations of archetypal gacha mechanics there are no safeguards against overspending on the part of the more exploitable subset of players.

Chinese people use Tieba, and there are several big communities on there that are solely focused on gacha, kinda like r/gachagaming or r/Genshin_Impact. Telling them the story of the Skinner box doesn't matter. As long as they get their waifus, they don't care.

Games in this category frequently dominate the top spots in Google Play’s revenue rankings.

No judgement, but reading you describe your experience I think you need to do less of the hard but optional content or lower the difficulty. Both those games are designed extensively to keep the player moving and feeling good during the main story. 

In general yes I agree with you and you often see it under extensive accessibility options. Parry windows, enemy health, tactics, are all starting to exposed to players as ways to tune the experience a bit",2,2025-03-29 04:30:22,Newwavecybertiger

It's strange how many things that ""technology can't handle"" were doable back in the 90's.  For example: Daggerfall (Elder Scrolls 2) had a fully adjustable, rotatable 3D map, which was flat-out abandoned for the rest of the franchise.  Sounds cool but just a novelty?  Dungeon design suffered for it (and considering that the vast majority of the dungeons in Daggerfall were just proc-gen assemblies of existing chunks, that's saying something), no question.  You can count the dungeons in the subsequent games that you *couldn't* casually map out on a napkin on the fingers of one hand.",2,2025-03-29 05:10:27,SidewaysGiraffe

I like when game difficulties lock abilities, phases, and content when you're too low in the difficulty.

Chances are you're just not playing the game the way they intend for you to play it. Experiment with different strategies and abilities and you'll probably find it more fun.

Apart from the campaign, LE is better in nearly all aspects otherwise. Way more room for experimentation without being overly complicated. Plus, LE has so many minion builds, which is an absolute dream for me. Pulling off builds and gear combinations just feels so much better in LE.

gaming,1jzr6zm,mnr3z1l,"If Blue Prince has a problem, it’s not an RNG problem, but a feedback problem.

The game is so much less random and uncontrollable than you think, and the game does so much more to enable progress and discovery than you might suspect. It’s pretty much impossible to ever be genuinely stuck. It’s pretty much impossible to have a run in which you genuinely do not progress or discover. (Unless, of course, you have yet to understand the basics of how to build a good estate). You don’t even need to be very good at puzzle games to reach credits, it will happen almost automatically after a while.

However none of this is signposted or announced, and the game gives you few tools to recognize which of the things you’ve done are progress on which of the many dimensions of progress that exist.

The significance of what you’ve done often only becomes apparant a little while later. That, I believe, is the feedback loop that a lot of people really love, and a lot of people really don’t.

gaming,1jzr6zm,mn9o1v0,"You're definitely not alone in that assessment (believe me. It's the biggest criticism I've seen of blue prince) but as someone who just reached credits last night and has already logged 34 hours (mostly from passive note taking let's be honest) I'd like to try to sway your opinion on this.

Here's the main thing that people are getting hung up on. Blue Prince is 50% puzzle game, but also 50% roguelike deck builder. The developer, I've heard, has even said that he's a huge fan of Magic the gathering. So if you're 100% in the puzzle game camp you might get confused and frustrated with the rng mechanics you have to play around in order to accomplish anything in the game. But if you're 100% in the roguelike camp, you might completely miss a lot of the important puzzles and end up having to do a lot of legwork when the game takes you aside and says, ""by the way, you should have been writing this all down"". 

Now, so far everything I've said is very fair criticism of the game and I think it's totally fair to be intimidated by it. Here's why it works for me. For my first few hours with the game, I too was confused by the roguelike elements and spent a lot of time trying to find the ""puzzle"" in this puzzle game. But that, in addition to the game's lack of dedicated note taking system, pretty much forced me to take note of *everything* and be extremely critical of the game in the process. I was ready to hate the game and I wanted to build up a mountain of evidence as to why I should. But then around hour three, something clicked with me. Without getting into spoilers, I began to notice a pattern in my notes, and realized that I had been writing down the solutions to puzzles I would eventually be encountering in later rooms. This right here is the game's biggest strength. Every tiny out of place detail in the game's world, from the mansion interior, to its exterior, to the very aesthetic of its world *is* relevant to the puzzles. and it will be on the test. This makes it incredibly rewarding to players who have been paying attention. But the game is also smart about this too. Because it builds ""hint redundancies"" into its puzzles. If every detail is a key to a puzzle you'll find somewhere else, then there are some puzzles that will have multiple keys in different rooms to the same puzzle. What does this mean? Even if you miss the subtle hints, you can find more blatant hints and even solutions to the puzzles just by exploring the mansion. It's almost like a metroidvania in this sense. It almost makes me wonder if it's possible for a player to reach credits by exclusively engaging with the roguelike elements and ignoring the puzzles.

And on the topic of roguelike elements. This is the second element of the game that really clicked with me. Because you're not just playing a walking sim. You're playing a deck builder. and a pretty robust deck builder at that. Once I found myself not struggling with the rng mechanics but actively working on builds to *break* them, the game became significantly more rewarding. I have a friend who's also playing the game at the same time as me (we have a trade agreement on spoilers) and he found even crazier ways to exploit the game's systems and make out like a bandit in the process.

On the one hand, games are bigger & take larger teams longer to make. However, the AAA space has dedicated teams that specialize in one type of game, streamlining that process (max efficiency).

Monetization has been on the rise consistently (DLC-> smaller split DLC-> micro transaction-> true gambling loot boxes-> Now selling 1 game as multiple parts ex FF7 remake)

Also, an increasingly digital world makes scaling production infinitely cheaper. The ""fixed"" cost of physical media is gone, so every game they sell increases profit & decreases cost per unit.

The majority of staffing now is contract as well. When they ""fire"" 2000 people, they are just not renewing contracts. Terrible practice long term as the average experience level in the industry will plummet & games are going to suck for the next few years from the big studios.

Nintendo still gave us Metroid Prime Remastered at $40 around the same launch window, showing there's likely still going to be tiered pricing across first party games. What people don't want is $70-80 for a 20-hour Kirby or Yoshi game.

""Man I hate how every game that releases nowadays is an unoptimized 20fps slopfest. I don't need these super overkill features like raytracing that barely make the game look better but massively tank frames. I just want it to run well and look good, and frame gen isn't helping."" - A _constant_ sentiment I see on online gaming communities.

So the game being this performant that it can run on old consoles is bad because uhhh they're... not using modern tech? Y'know, the same tech constantly being complained about?

Like in what fucked-up parallel dimension is it bad that it's optimized well? Because ""reasons?"" I never hear people shut up about how the tech being used in modern games is absolute garbage. Now suddenly a game comes along that works with older tech and now it's being complained about.

I get that I'm comparing opinions from potentially different people but goddamn I cannot fathom an existence in which it is even slightly logical to complain that a game runs on older generations. There is no worthwhile """"""new tech"""""" that is suddenly magically enabled by them focusing exclusively on the newest generations. Even raytracing can still be shit on the newest cards. Y'all are regurgitating slop you heard and didn't give thought.

Attention to optimization has become less and less of a priority because of this mindset. Instead of devs making a slight effort to make the game playable, the solution is now for the consumer to spend MINIMUM another $700 on a new gpu - which is not feasible for most people - every 2 minutes because this super amazing awesome new tech that makes light look VERY VERY slightly better is definitely worth the constant wallet draining (oh and by the way the game's still going to run like ass). We don't need more of this, we need less. The ""new tech"" is utter dogshit.

Look at the state of AAA games and tell me with a straight face that we need to push for them to be MORE demanding of resources.

There is no ""new tech"" that is remotely worth sacrificing this stuff for. So unbelievably silly.

gaming,1jjv2j4,mjtj8ar,"No cartridges are expensive as hell and the reason the PlayStation destroyed the N64, Nintendo were spending about $20-25 more than Sony per game because of extra manufacturing costs compared to the cents it costs to press a CD.


Before people start saying DS/Switch carts they're SD cards with a plastic shroud, extremely simple wiring and some contacts, that is much less than a traditional cart which has multiple rom chips, custom chips to add functionality (like the super FX chip), ram and (if it has save functionality) a battery (which will die and leak, damaging the cart) to keep the data stored in ram.

gaming,1k5a827,mogcq18,"Honestly, I totally get where you're coming from. Gaming is one of the best forms of entertainment when you think about how much time you can spend on a game compared to something like going to the movies or dinner. But yeah, prices have been all over the place, especially with big releases and remasters.

So, here’s my take on it:

🎮 AAA Singleplayer Games

For a fully fleshed-out, story-driven experience, £50–£60 seems fair. Games like The Witcher 3 or Red Dead Redemption 2 give you dozens (or even 100+) hours of content. For the hours you get, it’s a steal compared to a 2-hour movie at £15.

🎮 AAA Multiplayer Games

This one’s tricky because the value is long-term. Something like Call of Duty or Apex Legends might cost £60 initially, but if it keeps you playing for months, especially with regular updates, it can feel worth it. The downside is the rise in battle passes or microtransactions, which can start feeling like a money grab if it’s all cosmetic. But I think £60 up front, with extra content being optional, feels fair.

🎮 AAA Live Service Games

These games always make me nervous about the pricing. If they’re asking for £60 and then slapping a battle pass or microtransactions on top, it feels like you’re paying for a “half-finished” game. I’d rather see these games go free-to-play and then let people buy cosmetics if they want. But if the game provides regular updates and a lot of content, I get it. Still, I prefer seeing free-to-play + optional paid extras rather than feeling like I’m locked into extra costs for full access.

🎮 Indie Games

Honestly, these are the best bang for your buck. Indie devs put out incredible games like Hades or Celeste for £10–£30, and they’re often more innovative and fun than a lot of AAA titles. For the content and hours you get, they’re always worth the price. If you’re charging £30 for a beautifully made indie game, that feels right to me.

🎮 Early Access

This is where things get a bit more gray. If you're paying £20–£40 for an early access game, you should at least get regular updates and a solid base game. If it’s still pretty buggy or there’s little progress, it can feel unfair. But if the developers are actively improving it and engaging with the community, it's worth it. It’s like buying into a game that’s still being built, but you want to see the potential.

🎮 Remasters and Reboots

Here’s the thing—if a remaster offers a solid update with improved graphics, new content, and maybe some extra polish (think Resident Evil 2), then £30–£40 is worth it. But if it’s just a bare-bones update with no real improvements? Nah, that’s a bit of a cash grab. I don’t want to pay £50 for a game I’ve already played unless it’s got something fresh to offer.

The Sweet Spot?

For me, £30–£50 seems pretty reasonable for a lot of games, but it totally depends on the content and how much you get out of it. Anything higher than that, and I start expecting a LOT of content or value (no more paying £60 for a 10-hour campaign). Games with battle passes or microtransactions also need to be really good to make that model worth it.

gaming,1jrpxw9,mlgm8f7,"Here's a trick i heard about with aiming. It involves you going into the settings and tweaking the sensitivities, but I hear it's good advice.

Get into your game of choice, and get into a training lobby, or some place where you can fire freely without other players or computer enemies bothering you.

Pick starting point to aim at. Maybe a sign, a trashcan, training dummy, whatever. That will be your reset point. Now pick a second point on screen, something not too far from your Reset Target. That will be your Shoot Target.

Now here's the tricky part that you have to kinda 'feel' Flick your aiming stick/mouse what you BELIEVE should aim you directly at the Shoot target. If you feel like a little 'flick' should be all you need, than flick, if you feel like you should hold it for a smidge, hold it for a smidge.

Now that you've aimed how you think it 'should' be, see where you've ended up compared to your Shoot Target. Are you coming up short? Turn the sensitivity up so your reticle travels further. Is it flinging way off to the side? Turn that sensitivity down.

Eventually, you should start to see things start to sync up. And eventually that 'flick' that you thought SHOULD work, now DOES work.

Basically, rather than trying to get used to how the game feels, you tweak the settings so that the game is syncing up to how YOU feel. Give it a shot and see how things go.",16,2025-04-04 23:46:05,Too_Tall_64

gaming,1jrpxw9,mlgm1xn,"This might not help, but maybe you could record your gameplay during the aim training as well as during live games. You can then try to analyse your performance.

You might be doing amazing during the low intensity training, but be aiming clumsily during high stress live gameplay, and you wouldn't notice unless you were able to re-watch how you did.

Honestly, I would advise you to keep practicing your aim (not to the extent where it hurts tho), playing live games, and watching them after each match. Try to ask yourself questions about what exactly the nature of your losses are. If it's mechanical aiming, practice aiming more. If it's panic related, you need to spend more time in game to relax and not whiff during stressful moments.

I know folks may say you need longer sessions but tbh I’d lose interest personally. It took me a few months to see results. And they aren’t amazing results but they were there. I could see my accuracy like 3-8% above opponents of the same character. I imagine it has diminished returns but doing that over the course of many years should yield results.

People who have exceptional aim could honestly just be lucky and talented without much training. But not everyone at that level is, some got it through years of practice sessions.

In short, you should probably consider what working in the industry actually means. You're in software sales. The fact that it's a game doesn't really change the culture/business philosophy. Devs are subject to crunch, routine lay offs, and are very rarely allowed to put their artistic passion ahead of the monetization teams goals.

The tester -> full blown dev pipeline is not really a thing. If you're a genuinely stand out performer and can weasel your way into a managerial role you might after years get the chance to hop to another department as management(I've seen this work for 1 of 3 people). Most likely though testing is a dead end. Some testers make close to minimum wage, and many aren't even W2 employees.

Design is a comprehensive skill. You need a knowledge set that expands far beyond doodling/creative rough drafts. It is both technical and artistic.

I was one of those, and I didn't start enjoying games again until I left. You will also be overworked and severely underpaid relative to any other industry where a given skill set could be applied, and you will never have job security unless you master an extremely niche skill set (ex: shader programming). 


You clearly have a romantic idea of what it's like to work in games that you will be divorced of fairly quickly if you work in the industry. Talk to game devs first and consider both the good and the bad before you really consider this as a career path. Having done it myself, I would never recommend it to anyone.

gaming,1jk204g,mjs48up,"I don’t want to join the overly negative crowd but I have my own anecdotal story. I have also been gaming all of my life and wanted to get into the industry after college. My senior year of college I hopped on LinkedIn and started messaging people I happened to know working in the industry. I was able to land a paying internship at a Publisher working in their Marketing department. While I really loved some of the people I worked with, it was the worst job I’ve had. I disliked marketing games I thought were bad. I hated coming up with promotional materials that were misleading so that people would buy I game I thought sucked. I didn’t like that I would write an article and my boss would put her name on it and take credit. At the end of the day a job in gaming is just a job. 

I ended up shifting into IT, which is more stable and higher paying. Now I get to spend my free time playing and enjoying games while doing my work in a field that better meets my lifestyle and preferences. 

If you’re truly passionate about making games specifically, I’d say either pursue indie development, independent journalism (YouTube reviews), or streaming. All of them are extremely difficult to simply kickstart with no pre-existing skill or niche, and all of them probably have about the same success percentage. 

If you’re into acting- I think that’s cool too. I had thought about voice acting at one point as well. I even have the small home recording studio with microphones and noise dampeners to prove it haha. Needless to say in not a voice actor now, but I had fun pursuing the hobby and the skills and equipment did come in handy for other things.

You have two options. Only two.

1. Go to school for 4 years, do really well, earn a degree, and then compete with the thousands of other new grads trying to get into the gaming industry

2. Learn to make your own indie game

Both options are difficult. Both options take hard work. There is no easy path. 

If you were a high school kid I would encourage option 1, as even if you don’t score that dream job at Insomniac you’d still have a valuable skill set that can be applied elsewhere.

gaming,1jpsfv9,ml5ssru,"Of course haven't played through all games in existence, but for now my fav factions are the ones in New Vegas. They did a really good job at creating those factions without no one being the obvious good choice, which makes sense since it's a post apocalyptic world and if we don't have a ""perfect"" organization, can't see how they could have it in that setting.

Even Caesar's legion, while obviously portrayed as the ""evil guys"", does have its reasons. Cesar managed to create a big, united empire and they wanted to recreate that. They're cruel? Yes, no doubt. But the world they live in is definitely not ours.

NCR is trying to bring back the old world order, which is definitely a step up from Caesar in terms of morality. But they have serious management problems and of course they don't have the resources to help the entire Mojave Wasteland.

House is only interested in ""going forward"". He came to the conclusion that the world outside the Strip isn't worth much, so he just wants to make the Strip the actual new world with scientific progress in mind. And with an army of securitrons capable of wiping out an entire faction in seconds patrolling the streets to keep the Strip in order. So he's basically using the same fear factor of Caesar.

And then there are the minor factions, which are somewhat exaggerated but still fitting the crazy world of Fallout: the Boomers with their obsession of flying the heavy bomber, the Great Khans with their tribal lifestyle mixed with drugs, the Brotherhood of Steel with their (good on paper) mission of securing old technology to preserve knowledge and avoid misuse of said knowledge and so on",1,2025-04-03 06:44:34,MisterKraken

This is pretty much all. What's good about the PS5 is that if you like the PS4 exlusive library, there are some games that are still stuck there, which luckily are playable on PS5:

(I got these from a list on the Internet)

Shadow of the Colossus,
Bloodborn,
Infamous second Son,
Gravity Rush 1 & 2,
Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise,
Ratchet & Clank 2016.

There is probably more, but if you already own a PC and ps4, and you are not interested in the current or upcoming PS5 exclusives, then there is no reason for you to get a PS5
Personally, i have refrained from getting a PS5 for this reason. The library is really limited, and none of the games that are only on there are interesting to me

Another reason to get a PS5 is that if your PS4 no longer works and you have a PS4 library of games then it is technically better to get a PS5, but do your research cuz i have heard of some issues coming up like having to pay for the next gen upgrade for some games or you won't be able to play the PS4 game on PS5",2,2025-04-01 18:37:30,EmergencyComputer337

If you’re a GTA fan, rumours state the VI initial launch would be on consoles. Might as well keep the PS for future day on game plays.
Third party developers would eventually offer their titles on PC, so PS ends up being an optimal choice for casual gamers only.",1,2025-04-01 22:32:35,N/A
gaming,1jp29zc,mkybpie,"Depending on just how cheap, I'd be inclined to say go for it. Astro Bot is a must-play and I doubt it'll ever come to PC given the context of the game. There are still other good true exclusives too like Demon's Souls & if you're a racer, GT7 is the best racing sim out there.

Even ignoring those though, being able to skip the 12-24 month queues for ports that are often quite poor might make it worth it for future titles. You'd not have to wait for GTA6 either later this year.

Ultimately, if it's super cheap, you'd get your use out of it for it to be worth it, I'm sure.",1,2025-04-02 01:14:10,OctoriousYT

gaming,1jn46sf,mkktjri,"An avatar Open World RPG would be totally sick, but it might pose some challenges for potential game devs:

Traversal:
First off, traversing the world could be a problem. Airbenders are seen using kites or bisons to fly around the four nations. And flight adds a 3rd dimension to map design that could make map design a challenge to stop it from becoming repetitive. Also imagine the size of the game if they did this. They could compromise flight altogether though and settle for fast travel.

Combat:
Bending in general is a complex combat system even in writing. And to make an entire game based on it would be hard as shit. Im assuming if this game would be developed the main character would be the avatar, able to control the four elements. Fire water and air bending is fairly straightforward to convert to a combat system, fire breathes fire, waterbenders can have a gourd to pull water from and do cool combos, airbenders can push and pull enemies for some cool combos aswell. Earthbenders though... They take pieces from terrain and use it to attack, now imagine if the combat takes place within a town... Yes they could take a compromise again and just have the earthbenders spawn a stone model specifically for the attack, and after a couple of seconds it'd disappear. But me personally, that would ruin immersion.

Other than those two problems, I feel like this is a really cool idea that should be done! And developers have found many creative solutions to previously mind-boggling problems! Maybe these wouldn't be a challenge in the hands of a skilled dev-team. 

If this does happen though, I'd 100% preorder.",1,2025-03-30 20:40:39,Relevant-Can331
gaming,1jn46sf,mklf7gw,"I think the idea is far too big. There is just so much depth and variety to the world building and the bending mechanics. I don't think any studio in the world has the resources to do it justice.   
I think for this to work at all it would need to be really, really focused, e.g. just do an air temple.",1,2025-03-30 22:41:35,Ymi_Yugy

Either you are playing alot less new games today than you did back then and you are not noticing the good games from today, or you had more fun/interest in gaming back in the day, or your memory remembers only the good parts of the games and the flaws get ignored. Whatever the case is, games in general got better over the years.

Yes there are many shitty games today, but the PS2/3 times had tons of shit games aswell.

gaming,1jk6qxy,mjt4c22,"My main issue with now vs then is how game series are handled. 5th, 6th and 7th gen has this ability for devs to create a game, then a few years later (a year later for PS1) release a sequel, as good as or better than the last, then another 2-3 years later. Even if they only had minor updates or very little added. An entire series of games contained on 1 gen of console. GTA3, VC and SA, Uncharted 1-3, Gears of War 1-3, Mass Effect 1-3, stuff like that.

Now, we either get one offs or yearly shovelware. Series that seem to be doing great things, like Horizon or similar takes years for the next entry to arrive, not just a couple. Horizon 1 to 2 was 5 years, based on this we aren't getting 3 until 2027 (no doubt released 1 week before the next Mario Kart).

I also think there was a lot more put on to ""fun"" gaming, as things like Sing Star, Guitar Hero, Buzz and a lot of what Wii offered appealed to a mass audience. I'm not sure there is much of this anymore. It's kinda sad.",2,2025-03-26 10:06:25,Antergaton

I've got a lot of fond memories of the older games but I'm willing to bet it's 90% nostalgia. Very few probably hold up in 2025, but they were good for their time.

Wuthering and genshin have different vibes, but you could consider them analogous except that genshin has a lot more content because it's older. If you wanna start any of them, I suggest going to their subreddits to see if they have an FAQ for new players. These games can be overwhelming when you start and the FAQs will tell you what you can ignore. (In all three of these games, you can ignore all of the stat building and some of the items/currencies until late game) all three can be enjoyed a lot as free to play, but I feel like zzz is the most generous with rewards and such.

gaming,1jjanfn,mjlr9ty,"That awkward gaming lull is the perfect time to explore new genres — like diving into the gacha realm (gently, of course 😏).",2,2025-03-25 04:20:44,HoneydewStrong5932
gaming,1jjanfn,mjlsqwo,"My vote goes to WuWa. It's been making all the right decisions in the past few months, and course correcting from it's rather mediocre launch to something comparable to what you can get from big Japanese developers like SEGA, Capcom and Atlus. The devs also take feedback positively and implement them in a way that doesn't excessively squeeze the players for all their worth. The gacha is also the most generous amount the three, with no weapon 50/50, higher rates for 5\*s, lower roll count for the guarantee(10-20 less rolls than the other two games to get your guaranteed 5\*), 5\* dupes(up to 2 copies per 5\*) you can buy with side currency from rolling 4\*-5\*s in the gacha.

Genshin is great when it comes to their stories and lore, but you really have to keep in mind that they are the most predatory and nonchalant out of the three you've mentioned. Players have been giving feedback for years and almost none of it has been implemented. Play for the story and don't expect a lot on the customer care/gacha side because of the less than ideal rates, comparatively low rewards from events, and devs that implement things that 1% of the player base would enjoy(like the recent ""mail search"" feature) or implement things ""monkey paw"" style where theres a catch to what they implement.

ZZZ in my opinion is a very good game, just like WuWa. Gacha rates are similar to Genshin's but the devs actually feel like they genuinely care about their game. It did have a rocky start like WuWa but it's gotten fairly better over the time it's been up. Big caveat though is that it's made by the same company as Genshin's. It's great now, but it might not be in the future once the revenue for the game starts to dry up and the devs have to resort to more predatory tactics and cut corners to meet their ""revenue quota"", just like what HSR is doing.",2,2025-03-25 04:32:50,CasualCereal
gaming,1jjanfn,mjlopnr,"I'd say go with WuWa. It's been making a lot of correct decisions and listening to players feedback the most. The last area was much better than the first 2 and it's anniversary will be coming soon, the update is in 3 days and after that it'll have the steam release so there will be a lot of freebies for sure.

I haven't tried zzz but seems fun although it does seem targeted at a younger audience.

Genshin has 5 years of content you can play through at your own pace but events and characters will make you want to rush everything and A LOT of hype, lore, and cohesiveness came from being in the right place at the right time with events.

gaming,1jvde7w,mm9bdt3,"I mean, the core gameplay doesnt change. Its still hunts, and quests, but the locations change.

Of hearts of stones is good, but it really only opens up some ways to stregthen items. The story is good.

Blood and wine on the other hand is a new location, purchase a house, and a bunch of great stories.  Different atmosphere overall.

But still same gameplay though.

gaming,1ju9udf,mm0du3c,"This is why I have joined the /patientgamer attitude, I'm lucky enough to have over 1000 games in my steam back cat alone and then there's my old consoles with all their games ranging from ps1 to ps5 inc switch, DS and 3DS, I'll just wait til I find games ridiculously cheap now.

  
The reason my backcat is so large is due to playing far too much WoW and FFXIV over the years and just buying games in sales in the past, the only problem now is choosing a game to play when faced with it because there's so many I want to play but I struggle to settle on one til I finish it, which is why this year I made it my mission to just choose a game and get all achievements in it before moving on, im currently working on Elden Ring.",10,2025-04-08 10:13:31,Boo_Hoo_8258

gaming,1ju9udf,mm1v67j,"I could be way off base, but game pricing relative salaries could be a combination of wages not increasing at pace with inflation (as others have mentioned) alongside games becoming big business rivaling the film industry.

Looking at pc gaming specifically, when I was a kid in the 90s, Myst became one of the best selling games of all time at that point and Cyan, the studio that made it, was what we'd consider an indie developer today.

Another behemoth of the 90s, Doom, was also an indie game. There's tons more that could be listed. Small, independent studios have a lot less overhead and, at times, different motives. What feels like a huge pile of cash to an indie developer doesn't touch the scale of what huge studios today consider a decent profit.

This isn't unique to gaming; unfortunately there seems to be a pretty strong trend that when something at the intersection of art and entertainment becomes lucrative enough, much larger corporations form and inevitably seek larger profits.",1,2025-04-08 15:45:47,Dangerous-Cloud105
gaming,1ju9udf,mm1zimo,"Honestly I think gaming has never been cheaper in real terms. Vs. inflation costs are simply lower than at most points in the past and games are frequently heavily discounted. 
The maximum recommended retail price for a game going up should have been entirely expected, but it's also never the price you pay if you look around even a little bit. £45 is the most I've ever paid at launch for a first party switch game and the RRP for their most expensive switch 1 games are £59.99.",1,2025-04-08 16:07:13,Jamescw1400
