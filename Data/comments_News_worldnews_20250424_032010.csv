worldnews,1k2rbwr,mnwpk7n,">**More than 150 beaches along Russia’s southern Black Sea coast remain unsuitable for summer vacations due to ongoing contamination from a recent oil spill, the head of Russia’s consumer safety watchdog said Friday.**

>Oil slicks continue to be detected off the coast of Anapa, a popular resort town in the Krasnodar region, nearly four months after two aging Russian tankers were damaged in a powerful storm. The vessels released thousands of tons of heavy fuel oil into the sea, sparking an environmental crisis that has since cast serious doubt over the upcoming tourist season.

>“The Temryuksky district and the coastal areas of Anapa don’t meet the requirements for organizing summer resort holidays,” Rospotrebnadzor chief Anna Popova told reporters, according to the Interfax news agency.

>“At present, 141 beaches in Anapa and nine beaches in Temryuk have failed to meet pollution, sanitary and hygiene standards and cannot be used for health and recreational purposes.”

>The Temryuksky district lies just east of the Kerch Strait and borders annexed Crimea, another popular summer destination. Emergency workers have been deployed across affected areas to contain the spill and clean up contaminated coastlines, including beaches on the annexed Crimean peninsula.

>Despite the pollution, Russian authorities have continued to organize spring and summer trips to the affected areas for groups, including children with disabilities, raising safety concerns.

>In January, a 17-year-old university student died in Anapa after he was reportedly exposed to toxic fumes during volunteer efforts to clean up the oil spill.

>Still, on Friday, Popova offered a more optimistic assessment of the situation in Crimea and its port city of Sevastopol.

>“More than 6,000 samples tested... have shown no violations of hygienic norms,” she said, crediting rapid cleanup work for the relatively safe conditions. In contrast, over 60,000 samples were analyzed in the more severely affected Anapsky and Temryuksky districts.

>Popova noted that while “small spills” continue to be observed along the coast, they are being localized and contained swiftly. They “don’t affect the overall condition of the coastline,” she said.

>The spill and slow cleanup effort have already caused a steep drop in tourist demand for Anapa, threatening local economies that rely heavily on seasonal visitors. Last month, the government environmental watchdog Rosprirodnadzor said the oil spill had caused an estimated 84.9 billion rubles ($1 billion) in environmental damage.

>The companies that own the two oil tankers involved in the disaster face multiple lawsuits from regional prosecutors, the Russian Maritime Rescue Service and the city of Anapa, which in March said that it had spent 211 million rubles ($2.4 million) on beach cleanup since the Dec. 15 spill.

>According to an investigation by transportation authorities, the ships were not supposed to sail in the open sea during winter, as they were designed mainly for river navigation and calm coastal areas.",11,2025-04-19 10:57:44,BubsyFanboy

Seems the end game here is to have European and US troops in the country (our PM, Kier Starmer, just reiterated that no troops would be deployed without US involvement, and that seems likely under their minerals deal) which would back Putin into a corner. 

Indeed, we in the UK and Europe also have minerals deals in place - ours was signed in January as part of a wider deal, and the EU I believe is ratifying theirs at the moment. 

We'll just start deploying troops to ""protect mineral mining in Ukraine"" which is basically a way to get troops into Ukraine without Putin saying ""but you're just protecting Ukraine itself!"" then he's fucked. He can't do anything then.

worldnews,1jntwvx,mkndt1t,"One thing that's totally foolish is how these NGOs typically are pro Palestine and anti-Israel. Their messages online are extremely hostile and their workers have all picked one side despite sometimes living in Israel or visiting Israel to relax. I'm not going to speculate on single cases. But you really don't want to constantly piss off one side in a war as an NGO. If they were extremely pro Israel it would be a mistake too. At the end of the day we are still talking about single soldiers deciding if your name and logo should protect you in any single case. You'd want single soldiers to always error towards keeping you safe. What happens if you have 6 Hamas fighters in your car using it for safe transport to a battle? And now you have opposing soldiers seeing this knowing you hate their side. So they figure you are working for Hamas directly.

You'd have single soldiers erroring on the side of hitting Hamas even if your trucks are nearby. It's still wrong and should not happen. But it's like the NGOs don't understand common sense. Why are you showing extreme animosity towards a side with guns and rockets? Just putting the lives of your workers in danger. It's totally perplexing and horrid.

Imagine if an NGO helped during the Iraq war and then on their site talked about how evil the Ba'ath party is, daily. Do you think it would keep your workers more or less safe? Or they could talk about how evil USA is for being there. You better hope both those single American soldiers responsible for the drone strikes have never visited your site or read your propaganda.

I would straight up refuse to work for such groups. And I don't understand why they would ever think their anti-Israel messaging is a smart idea.

Tell your workers to not speak up online for one side or the other while they work. I think a lot of people have a totally misguided understanding of Israel like it's an army making no errors as they are Western and modern. They absolutely make errors, daily. You want them to not make errors. That's in your interest. Some of these soldiers don't have much experience either.",-39,2025-03-31 07:15:18,Mister-Psychology

*President Xi Jinping on Wednesday stressed that China would stand with Malaysia and other Asian nations to combat unilateralism and protectionism, as the Trump administration's U.S. tariff policies cloud economic prospects in the region.*

*Xi was in Malaysia for a three-day state visit, his first trip to the Southeast Asian country since 2013.*

*""In the face of shocks to global order and economic globalization, China and Malaysia will stand with countries in the region to combat the undercurrents of geopolitical and camp-based confrontation, as well as the countercurrent of unilateralism and protectionism,"" Xi said during his dinner party speech. ""Together, we will safeguard the bright prospects of our Asian family.""*

*Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim also touched on the recent trade tensions in his dinner speech. ""Trade is not a contest of winners and losers, but a shared endeavor. ... What we are witnessing today is not an honest reckoning with the imperfections of globalization, but a retreat into economic tribalism,"" he said, adding that trade tariffs are being weaponized.*

*""China has been a rational, strong and reliable partner. Malaysia values this consistency,"" Anwar said.*

*The two countries, on the same day, exchanged a total of 31 memoranda of understanding (MOU) and bilateral agreements, spanning security, trade, infrastructure, digital economy, education, and cultural cooperation, highlighting further collaboration in various areas.*

*""China-Malaysia relations are now entering a new golden era,"" Xi told Anwar at the beginning of their meeting earlier in the day.*",129,2025-04-16 13:43:15,NikkeiAsia

The airbase, home to Tu-22M3 strategic bombers, was targeted by drones during the night of March 31, 2025.

The strike significantly damaged the base’s infrastructure, particularly a facility for preparing Kh-22/32 missiles, where fueling and launch configuration occurs.

Satellite imagery of the Russian Shaikovka airbase, caption reads Liquid fueling station for missiles (yellow, left) and technical facilities with equipment for missile preparation and maintenance (red, right). (Source: CyberBoroshno)
According to CyberBoroshno, these missiles require liquid fuel, but satellite images show that the stationary fueling stations have vanished following the strike.

Destroyed storage facilities for the supersonic Kh-22/32 missiles were also identified at the airbase. One heavily damaged depot was located near an aircraft parking area, as confirmed by satellite imagery.

In one section of the base, the object present could not be clearly identified. Visually, it appears that it may be aircraft wreckage, though it’s also possible that it is the remains of a building.

At the time of the attack, local authorities reported that 24 drones were launched at the base and claimed that all had been successfully intercepted by air defense systems. However, they did not comment on the explosions that were heard at the facility.

worldnews,1jz5ten,mn5w6eg,"This is a great opportunity for the EU, UK, and others (Canada, Australia, NZ, Latin America, maybe Turkey) to finally realize that the US is not needed for them to function. Together they have more people, more money and plenty of tech, military toys (including nukes) and natural resources – including much more oil - to work with each other - and leave the US outside looking in.  China can be a part of this. Let the MAGAs find out what relying on Russia is like. The US has been in decline for some time; MAGA stuff and moves like this are just a sort of official recognition of that fact. We are the latest second-rate nation on the world scene.  One of the great unintended ironies of all this is that MAGA, instead of making America great, are destroying what made American great in the first place, and in the process are rapidly pulling the US down toward the bottom of the pile.  We are becoming a second-rate nation with nukes. Like Russia.

Not long ago Trump declared, with his usual smug certainty, that from 1789 to 1913, the United States was the wealthiest it’s ever been, purely because of tariffs. According to him, we were collecting so much money so fast that the government didn’t know what to do with it. Of course, he left out the part where most Americans lived in poverty, where wealth was concentrated in a few monopolists' hands, and where child labor and 14-hour workdays – 6 or 7 days a week - were the norm. The “wealth” he refers to was largely theoretical for the average citizen and absolutely real for the Carnegies, the Rockefellers, and other Robber Barons of the Gilded Age. Tariffs weren’t some magic goose laying golden eggs, they were regressive taxes that hit working people hardest, all while padding the profits of a corrupt elite.

>The Greenlandic association behind the large annual dogsled race, KNQK, applied on March 11 for an extra grant from the Greenlandic government for support to transfer dogs, equipment, etc., to Sisimiut where the race is held.

>Posted by op somewhere In the application letter, they had a threatening tone that if not granted, they would be “forced” to go to the US for help in the form of military-grade helicopters CH47.

>Meanwhile they were in contact with the US consulate for support which was granted through the form of an Air Greenland plane for transport and some economic support which is said to be a “large amount” but not public.

>They were then “informed” by the US consulate that they should invite US officials as a contingency for the support.

>They sent a letter of invitation to US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. However, he is not coming, instead getting Usha Vance and a few high-ranking officials.

>When they hadn’t received the grant on March 24, they withdrew their grant application for the Greenlandic Government.

>So, technically they were invited. But after essentially forcing an invitation and not by officials. In fact, both Danish and Greenlandic officials have declined meetings. This whole process reeks of corruption and blackmail.

The death toll from [the powerful earthquake in Myanmar](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/03/28/myanmar-new-capital-city-dust-earthquake-thailand/) has surpassed 1,000, as rescuers use their bare hands to dig through rubble for survivors.

The country’s military regime said 1,002 people had been found dead after the shallow 7.7 magnitude quake hit the centre of the country on Friday afternoon, followed by several strong aftershocks.

The junta said in a statement that most of the dead were in the Mandalay, the country’s second largest city, and 2,367 people were confirmed injured.

Rescuers are now in a race against time to pull people from collapsed buildings.

# ‘We heard screams, then silence’

“We are doing our best to rescue survivors,” Yan Naing, a rescue worker at Sky Villa Condo, told The Telegraph. One of Mandalay’s most expensive apartment blocks, the building sank into the ground when the disaster struck.

“We heard screams last night, but this morning, there was silence. We continue to do everything we can to save lives.”

Some two miles away, Dr Aung Win said Mandalay General Hospital had been “overwhelmed by the surge in patients”.

“With so few doctors and nurses, our capacity is extremely limited,” Dr Win told the Telegraph. “We urgently need reinforcements. 

“It’s heartbreaking to see patients dying when they shouldn’t be, and we desperately need first aid kits. We were never prepared for a disaster like this.”

its also moot to make inferences on these strikes, as it most likely hit the wrong target. Russian military commanders and servicemen do not get promotions based on how many schools and hospitals they blow up. heck, even the Nazi's prosecute Wehrmacht commanders who knowingly target civilians.

the highest priority for missile strikes are air defenses, aircrafts and radar, since this allows Russian aircrafts to safely fly over and establish air dominance. command and control targets are next on the list, usually struck right before an operation begins to prevent a defensive response. pretty much only high value targets justify a missile strike. low priority targets are struck with drones, rockets and artillery. as much as the Russians have an endless inventory of missiles, they are not gonna squander it targets with no military value.",-13,2025-03-25 13:07:45,SQQQ

This has resulted in the actual number of abortions, not just the rate, falling for the last several years even though the number of women childbearing age is increasing.

Now having said that in Canada all abortions are done early in the first trimester, only 2-3% are done after 16 weeks, and no doctor performs abortions past 20 or 21 weeks except for compelling health or genetic reasons. Third trimester abortions are extremely rare and are only done if the mother's life is in immediate critical danger because it is safer to stabilize the mother so she can go to term than to introduce the physical trauma of an extremely late term abortion.

There’s no feasible way a bank would’ve known this money was being withdrawn to avoid incoming sanctions once Russia invaded Ukraine in the future. If anything this was an oversight by regulators to preemptively enact sanctions prior to the invasion to prevent this from happening, however even that I think is a bit over critical.

The travel information for the USA for Norwegian citizens now states:

“ESTA or a visa does not guarantee entry.It is the immigration authorities upon arrival who make the final decision.Norwegian authorities cannot intervene in this decision.

Crimes in the United States, false statements about the purpose of your stay, or having previously stayed in the United States longer than permitted can result in you being rejected at the border.

When applying for an ESTA or visa to the USA, there are two gender designations to choose from: Male or Female.The United States only recognizes the applicant's gender at birth.

Sure that will *eventually* change again, but what they offer is next level tools.  Planes, nanometer fabrication tech, consulting, etc....  which require advanced technical minds.  

Anyhow, if you think manufacturing of iPhones is coming back with tariffs, than you are blocking those other services which actually make you money for what you ""think"" can come back.

There's not really much to add to this conversation that hasn't already been said elsewhere so you're probably not going to find many Canadians commenting but here's some points:

1. The Cons released their costed platform only after advanced voting had closed knowing it would be unpopular, the document date was from last Friday.
2. The Cons are trying to make this work by projecting some insane growth rate of 5%, which is lofty in the best of times but right now? Holy shit,
3. They did this same thing in British Columbia, withholding a costed platform until the last minute and then releasing numbers that banked on imagination and fairy tales.
4. This costed platform doesn't work, it's a detriment to Canadians and it's more of the same type of DOGE-esque bullshit we've seen from America.
5. After tanking in the polls the Cons have done everything they could, which wasn't much to try and detach themselves from being Maple MAGA, this just affirms they really are.

worldnews,1k4h9aj,mo9xxox,"""The head of Israel's domestic intelligence service said on Monday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's bid to sack him followed his refusal to fulfil requests that included spying on Israeli protesters and disrupting the leader's corruption trial.

In an affidavit submitted to the Supreme Court, the head of Shin Bet, Ronen Bar, said that Netanyahu's March move to dismiss him was not based on professional grounds but was prompted by unmet expectations of personal loyalty to the prime minister.

In response, Netanyahu's office said it would soon deliver a detailed refute of Bar's affidavit, which it called ""false"".

Netanyahu's move to sack Bar fuelled [protests](https://archive.is/o/kfvpW/https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-opposition-netanyahu-finds-voice-war-returns-gaza-2025-03-19/) in Israel and was suspended by the Supreme Court, after political watchdogs and opposition lawmakers argued the dismissal was unlawful.

Critics say that the government is undermining key state institutions and endangering the foundations of Israeli democracy. Netanyahu's Likud party has [accused Bar](https://archive.is/o/kfvpW/https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-pm-netanyahus-party-steps-up-pressure-shin-bet-head-go-2025-04-15/) of acting against the prime minister and turning parts of the Shin Bet service into ""a private militia of the Deep State.""

Israel's government has [backed](https://archive.is/o/kfvpW/https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/anti-netanyahu-protesters-clash-with-israeli-police-2025-03-20/) Netanyahu, who said that he had lost confidence in Bar over the agency's failure to prevent the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, a security failure that had led to the country's deadliest day.

But in the unclassified part of his affidavit, Bar argued that the quest to oust him began more than a year after the attack. He cited a series of events between November 2024 and February 2025, which he said appeared to prompt the prime minister's moves against him.

Those included Shin Bet investigations into leaks of secret army documents to the media and possible links between Netanyahu aides and Qatar, and a Shin Bet inquiry into its own failings, which also pointed to the government ignoring warnings before the October 7 attack and policy failures that preceded it."" - Reuters",100,2025-04-21 16:13:47,Crossstoney

worldnews,1jq5qke,ml4mscc,"Snippet from this news article:”Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has said US tariffs on European Union imports are “wrong”, after US President Donald Trump announced he would begin charging a 20% rate on EU goods.
Meloni is one of the many world leaders reacting to Trump’s “liberation day” announcements, which include a universal 10% baseline tariff on all imports into the US from 5 April.
Around 60 countries - including the EU - will be hit with steeper tariffs from 9 April. Some of the highest rates will be levied on smaller countries, such as Lesotho, which has been hit with a 50% levy.
Trump said the measures would “make America rich again”, adding that he had been “very kind” in his decisions.

Meloni, a Trump ally, said the EU tariffs would “not suit either party” - referring to the EU and the US - but that she would work towards a deal with the US to “prevent a trade war”.
Her Spanish counterpart Pedro Sánchez said Spain would protect its companies and workers and “continue to be committed to an open world.”
Irish trade minister Simon Harris said he was ready to negotiate with the US, calling it the “best way forward”, while Taoiseach Micheál Martin said Trump’s decision was “deeply regrettable” and benefitted “no-one”.
Outside of the EU, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Americans would end up paying the biggest price for what he called “unjustified tariffs”, but said his government would not impose reciprocal measures.
“We will not join a race to the bottom that leads to higher prices and slower growth”, he added.
Latin America’s biggest economy, Brazil, approved a law in congress on Wednesday - the Economic Reciprocity Law - to counter the 10% tariff imposed by Trump. There was no immediate reaction from the president, but last week Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said his country “cannot stand still” in face of the tariffs.
Shortly after Trump’s announcement, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned countries not to “retaliate” and “sit back, take it in”.",13,2025-04-03 01:29:20,AndroidOne1

worldnews,1jrk796,mlfafcj,"***The Telegraph reports***:

Emmanuel Macron is set to become Europe’s point man to hold talks with Vladimir Putin over peace in Ukraine, The Telegraph can reveal.

Some members of the “coalition of the willing” have pushed for a European leader to take the helm on engaging Russia as part of efforts to support Kyiv.

The French president and Sir Keir Starmer, who lead the group of nations planning to secure any ceasefire deal in Ukraine, have been singled out as the most likely interlocutors with Moscow.

But The Telegraph understands Sir Keir has no plans to hold talks with [Putin](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/04/03/the-longer-the-war-goes-on-the-weaker-putin-becomes/) as part of the UK’s efforts to support Ukraine’s defence.

An Élysée Palace source said Mr Macron was willing to take up the role “when the time is right”.

Mr Macron has positioned himself as Europe’s go-between with Putin since the start of his full-scale invasion.

He opted to leave diplomatic channels open with Moscow longer than any of Europe’s most ardent supporters of Kyiv, despite harsh criticism for his actions.

But he ended any direct contact with the Kremlin when it became obvious to him Putin had no intention of halting his invasion.

Asked whether the time was right to resume contact with the Russian president, the Élysée official told The Telegraph: “Apparently, not yet.”

So far, Donald Trump is the only world leader to engage directly with Putin on the mechanics of a ceasefire deal.

Some in Europe believe the US president has been too lenient on Putin, whom he has often heaped praise on and promised to reset relations with as part of the peace process.

This week, Alexander Stubb, the Finnish president, said Britain and France should take the lead on any talks with Putin.

“My personal preference would be that our representatives of the coalition of the willing would be doing that. In other words, France or the United Kingdom,” he said.

France and Britain are happy to allow Mr Trump’s diplomatic attempts to end the war play out, but have called for further pressure to be applied on Putin to encourage him to come to the negotiating table.

> In an interview with Belgium’s VRT broadcaster on Thursday, Prime Minister Bart De Wever was asked about Hungary’s decision to not act on the ICC warrant against Netanyahu during the Israeli leader’s visit to Budapest this week.

> “To be completely honest, I don’t think we would either,” De Wever said during the interview.

> “There is such a thing as realpolitik, I don’t think any European country would arrest Netanyahu if he were on their territory. France wouldn’t do it, and I don’t think we would, either.”

> ...

> After the ICC’s decision to issue the warrants, several countries, including Hungary, Argentina, the Czech Republic, Romania, Poland, France, and Italy, have said they would not arrest Netanyahu if he visited.

Prime Minister Mark Carney pledged to make Canada the world’s “leading energy superpower” through a plan that includes establishing a single office that would decide on major projects within two years.The Liberal Party leader said at a campaign stop in Calgary that his government would create a Major Federal Project Office with a “one project, one review” mandate. The aim would be to eliminate duplication of federal and provincial environmental assessments, speeding up reviews.“We are going to aggressively develop projects that are in the national interest in order to protect Canada’s energy security, diversify our trade, and enhance our long-term competitiveness — all while reducing emissions,” Carney said in a statement. “We can lead the energy transition while ensuring affordable energy at home and building the strongest economy in the G-7.”Mark Carney, Canada’s prime minister, speaks during a campaign rally in Calgary on Tuesday.*Photographer: Gavin John/Bloomberg*Canada ships some 4 million barrels of crude a day to the US — the vast majority of its production — and also relies on a pipeline that goes through midwestern states to supply provinces in the east. US President Donald Trump’s threats to Canada’s economy and sovereignty have intensified pressure to accelerate projects that reduce its dependence on the US.Carney Pledges to Speed Permits, Make Canada ‘Energy Superpower’",1,2025-04-09 23:59:03,Acceptable-Pie-7522

worldnews,1k1bnhb,mnkox49,"Russia escaped unscathed from President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs unveiled earlier this month, but the Kremlin says Moscow is not immune from the economic aftershocks that could ensue in a potential global trade war.

Unlike many U.S. allies who were hit with trade tariffs in Trump’s early-April announcement, Russia was spared new import tariffs when Trump announced his wide-ranging list of new duties to be imposed on imports from more than 180 countries, ostensibly aimed at leveling up the global trading playing field.

Russia was left out, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Axios media outlet, because U.S. sanctions on the country for its invasion of Ukraine in 2022 already precluded “any meaningful trade” between the two nations. CNBC has requested further comment from the White House and is awaiting a response.

>At least 5,700 homes in the city, which was taken by Russia following a long siege in 2022, have been earmarked for potential seizure, according to the report. 

>A complex bureaucratic system that requires the homeowner to report to officials in Mariupol means that many Ukrainian refugees whose homes have been classed as potentially “ownerless” will inevitably find it difficult to claim their property. 

>Earlier this month, a former advisor to Mariupol’s legitimate Ukrainian mayor said that Moscow is planning to settle five million Russians in the territories it occupies in eastern and southern Ukraine. 

>Russia has launched well-documented efforts to “Russify” areas that have come under its control since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine just over three years ago. These efforts include alleged mass abductions of local children and measures aimed at pressuring residents to take up Russian nationality. 

>Having Russian citizenship is also a feature of the process of reclaiming a home suspected of being “ownerless” in Mariupol, according to the BBC’s report. 

>Once officials announce a property as having “signs of being ownerless,” the owner must appear in Mariupol with ownership documents and a Russian passport within 30 days. Other forms of ID may be accepted, though they are not specified by the authorities. 

>If no one claims ownership within the timeframe, the property is declared “ownerless.” After three months, local authorities can request a court ruling to bring it into public ownership. Some 600 flats have been seized so far, the Moscow-installed city mayor said, according to the report. 

>Russia’s President Vladimir Putin issued a decree in March targeting Ukrainian citizens who are yet to take up the offer of Russian nationality. 

>Those who do not sign up before mid-September will be threatened with “deportation,” which may in reality mean transportation to a detention center, according to a recent report by The Kyiv Independent.

Argentina’s government will declassify all government-held files on Nazi fugitives who settled in Argentina after World War II, a top official has confirmed.

Cabinet Chief Guillermo Francos announced Tuesday that President Javier Milei had ordered the release and declassification of the archives. 

The files will concern “Nazis who sought refuge in Argentina and were protected for many years,” Francos explained in an exclusive interview with journalist Alfredo Leuco for the DNEWS media outlet. 

The order includes documents detailing banking and financial transactions, as well as records held by Argentina’s Defence Ministry, said the official.  

Milei’s decision follows a meeting at the Casa Rosada on February 17, 2025, between the head of state and US Republican Senator Steve Daines, an ally of US President Donald Trump and advocate for public access to the documents.

Francos made his announcement just a day after Presidential Spokesperson Manuel Adorni said that secret files on the actions of the Armed Forces during the 1976-1983 military dictatorship would be declassified.

""The President has instructed that all relevant documents from any state institution be made public because there is no reason to keep them classified,"" Francos said. 

Like Adorni’s announcement on the military files, he noted that an earlier government decree had ordered the release of these files, but that it had never been implemented.

 ""What the President is saying is that these are historical records that must be available in the National General Archive so that anyone can access them,” explained the Cabinet chief. 

A number of notorious Nazi war criminals escaped and found refuge in Argentina after World War II. Many of the fugitives arrived in the immediate post-war years, during the first government of Juan Domingo Perón, and were shielded from justice for decades.

Among the most infamous was Adolf Eichmann, one of the chief architects of the ""Final Solution"" — the Nazi party’s genocidal plan to exterminate European Jews. 

Eichmann arrived in Argentina in 1950 under the alias ‘Ricardo Klement,’ using one of a series of international escape routes for fascists known as the ""ratlines.""  He lived discreetly in Buenos Aires until 1960, when he was captured by Mossad and taken to Israel, where he was tried and executed.

Another notorious fugitive was Josef Mengele, the man known as Auschwitz’s ""Angel of Death,"" who was infamous for carrying out brutal medical experiments. 

Mengele arrived in Argentina in 1949 and lived there for a decade before fleeing to Paraguay and later to Brazil, where he died in 1979 under a false identity.

Former SS commander Erich Priebke, who responsible for the Fosse Ardeatine massacre in Italy, also settled in Argentina in 1948, living in Bariloche until his discovery in the 1990s and subsequent extradition to Italy.",64,2025-03-25 18:29:14,ElRama1

>  52-year-old Private Alexander Alekseevich Konev, serving with the 3rd battalion of the 1008th Motorized Rifle Regiment (military unit 29297), says that despite having a medical exemption from service due to sickness or injury, his commander intends to send him to an assault.

> Konev is currently at a training ground awaiting a consultation with a neurologist and a military-medical commission. Although he does not say what is wrong with him, the neurology appointment suggests a head or traumatic brain injury.

>Despite this, he says, his unit's deputy commander, callsign 'Azur', arrived at the training ground and refused to take his medical certificates into account:

> ""When asked directly that there were two previous assaults and a medal earned and no respect, he said – I don't care. We don't need you sick. We need healthy people.""

> ""When asked directly that there were two previous assaults and a medal earned and no respect, he said – I don't care. We don't need you sick. We need healthy people.""

> ""You will go ahead of the sappers. Well, roughly speaking, to trample mines, to pave the way. You will die, he said, you will die.

> ""Since you have no health, you are not needed.""

> Konev's wife, Natalya has confirmed the authenticity of the appeal and asked for help in distributing the video. She says that she has already sent complaints to the military authorities but has not yet received a response.

>The agreement, aimed at reaping more revenue from an industry marred by smuggling and corruption, was reached before Rwanda-backed M23 rebels launched a major offensive in January that has seen them seize eastern Congo's two largest cities.

>Discussions now on implementing the deal with Prince come as the US and Congo explore a broader deal on critical minerals partnerships, after Congo pitched a security deal to US President Donald Trump's administration.

>Prince, a former US Navy Seal, founded Blackwater before renaming the private military company and selling it in 2010 after several employees were indicted on charges of unlawfully killing Iraqi civilians. the men were convicted but later pardoned by Trump during his first term.

>The Trump administration has not said how the US might contribute to security in Congo as part of any minerals deal. Analysis and former US officials have said leaning on security contractors could be an option.

>A Congolese government source told Reuters that any agreement between Congo and Prince would need to be reviewed in light of the push for a deal with the US. 

>The security deal was agreed with the finance ministry and Prince's advisers will focus on improving tax collection and reducing cross-border smuggling of minerals, the two sources close to Prince said. There were no plans to deploy security to active conflict areas.

>The initial plan was to deploy contractors to Goma, the capital of North Kivu province and the largest city in eastern Congo. But now it's under M23 control and the plan is on hold.

>A source in the office of Congolese  President Felix Tshisekedi said an agreement in principle has been signed with Prince, but details on where and how many advisers will be deployed remained to be established. Some Prince-controlled companies have operated in Congo since 2015. They have been involved in trucking and have sought to get into the minerals sector.

A Danish 11-year-old raised over 34,000 Danish kroner (approximately $4,900) by making beaded Easter chicks to help Ukrainian children who lost their homes during the ongoing war.

Since Russia’s full-scale invasion began, Denmark was a strong supporter of Ukraine, providing billions in military aid, including long-range Harpoon coastal defense missile systems and F-16 fighter jets, significantly enhancing Ukraine’s air and coastal defense capabilities.

Denmark committed approximately DKK 50 billion ($7.2 billion) in military support under the Ukraine Fund from 2023 to 2028. The country was also a pioneer in purchasing weapons directly from the Ukrainian defense industry, supporting Ukraine’s defense production.

Apart from military, Denmark is also involved in sending humanitarian aid and supporting reconstruction efforts in Ukraine.

Jens Fog Thomsen creates and sells beaded Easter chicks in Ukraine’s national blue and yellow colors as his fundraising method, according to Ukraine’s Minister of Economy Yuliia Svyrydenko.

This initiative began after he saw news coverage of Ukrainian children displaced by the war. “What can we do?” Jens asked his mother upon seeing the reports. His mother encouraged him to “create goodness.”

The young philanthropist’s efforts have yielded consistent results. This year alone, he raised 6,000 kroner ($870), which was then doubled to 12,000 ($1,739) by KOLO Nordic, a Danish NGO dedicated to providing direct humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. Last year’s fundraising brought in 28,000 kroner ($4,059).

Denmark’s Minister for Business, Morten Bødskov, met with Jens to acknowledge his contribution. “We ate burger and Jens talked about the great job. This is SO beautiful. I actually have no words for it. 11 years! Hundreds of chickens. Thousands of kroner for Ukrainian children,” Bødskov stated.


Svyrydenko recorded a personal video message thanking Jens and his family, noting that his actions demonstrate that “generosity of spirit has no age.”",52,2025-03-31 23:43:43,Well-Sourced

Ukraine has received the latest installment of the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) budget support amounting to $400 million, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on March 31.

The funds represent the latest tranche of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program, which will provide Kyiv with $15.6 billion in budget support over four years. With the additional $400 million in funding, the program has now distributed $10.1 billion in financing to Ukraine.

The IMF's executive board approved the $400 million tranche on March 29 after completing its seventh review of the EFF agreement.

""We are grateful to the Fund... for its assistance and close cooperation in supporting the Ukrainian economy during the war,"" Shmyhal said on X.

""Russia's war in Ukraine continues to take a devastating social and economic toll on Ukraine,"" IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said in a press statement. ""(Ukraine's) economy has remained resilient, but the recent growth slowdown is expected to persist in 2025 due to headwinds from energy needs and a tight labor market. Contingency planning is key to enable appropriate policy action should risks materialize,"" the statement reads.

Commenting on Ukraine's monetary policy, the managing director urged Ukraine's National Bank to ""stand ready for further action"" should inflation expectations deteriorate.

The central bank raised the key policy rate from 14.5% to 15.5% per annum in its most recent change to interest rates. In 2024, inflation in Ukraine exceeded expectations, accelerating to 12%.

Funds from the EFF are intended to help stabilize Ukraine, support the country's postwar recovery, and promote economic growth as Kyiv moves forward on its path to EU membership.

External financing is critical for Ukraine as it faces mounting economic pressure from Russia's full-scale invasion. Kyiv received $42.5 billion in foreign aid last year, and the Finance Ministry has said that the amount needs to increase by at least $12 billion for 2025.",50,2025-03-31 11:52:35,Well-Sourced

Ivan Petrovskyi, an officer with the National Guard of Ukraine (NGU), who was recently freed from Russian captivity, lost 40 kilograms during his detention.

 Petrovskyi, 30, posted before-and-after photos on Instagram. ""I'm home. The difference is 1037 days of captivity and minus 40 kilograms,"" Petrovskyi captioned one of the photos.

Petrovskyi's mother told the Ukrinform news agency that her son had been brought back home as part of a POW swap on 19 March, during which Ukraine liberated 175 defenders.

Born in Brovary, Kyiv Oblast, Petrovskyi later moved with his parents to Zhytomyr Oblast. He was drafted into the National Guard in 2015, and after completing his service, he signed a contract to remain in his unit.

Later, Ivan moved to Mariupol, where he served in the 12th Operational Brigade. He was involved in defending the city from Russian forces following the onset of the full-scale invasion.

Ivan was taken prisoner in May 2022 and spent nearly three years in Russian captivity. His mother noted that he was initially held in the Olenivka penal colony before being transferred to Russia's Volgograd Oblast.

During his captivity, Ivan Petrovskyi faced health issues.

His parents, wife, daughter and son eagerly awaited his return home.",50,2025-03-24 12:48:10,Well-Sourced

In Ukraine, it isn’t just professional soldiers who are standing up to the enemy. They have been joined by countless civilians who have donned military uniform: drivers and doctors, managers and engineers, accountants and construction workers...

This is brought home when you hear the story of Nataliia Hrabarchuk, a former kindergarten teacher who shot down a Russian missile.

On 17 November 2024, Russia conducted yet another large-scale air attack on Ukraine, deploying 90 drones and 120 missiles of various types: Zircons, Iskanders, Kinzhals... Ukraine’s air defence forces – anti-aircraft missile troops, F-16, Su and MiG pilots, mobile fire groups and electronic warfare units – managed to destroy 140 aerial targets that day.

One of those targets, a Kh-101 cruise missile, was shot down by Nataliia Hrabarchuk, an anti-aircraft gunner in the missile unit of the 1st Halychyna and Volhynia Radio Technical Brigade of Air Command Zakhid (West). You may have already seen the video of her perfect shot on social media. It shows Nataliia standing on the roof of a building with an Igla man-portable air defence system (MANPADS) on her shoulder. Seconds later, the missile hurtles into the sky, a curved path of white smoke trailing behind it. Nataliia kneels to put down the launch tube and joins her hands together as if in silent prayer. Then there is an explosion.

""Did you get it?"" the other women ask each other. Then, when they are sure, they shout joyfully: ""You got it! Natasha, you got it!""

It was her first combat mission.",28,2025-03-31 00:25:41,Well-Sourced

Ukraine’s SBU Security Service has detained two locals in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast who were allegedly planning terrorist attacks at the behest of Russia, the agency’s press service reported on Telegram on April 1.

The suspects, one of whom has a criminal record for theft, were reportedly recruited through Telegram channels offering easy money.

According to the investigation, the primary target was a pickup truck belonging to a mobile fire group of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The agents planned to plant an improvised explosive device (IED) under the vehicle and detonate it via a phone call.

Following this attack, the men were instructed to prepare another explosion near the central entrance of the territorial military recruitment center in the Nikopol district.

The SBU apprehended both suspects as they prepared the explosive device and conducted reconnaissance near the military pickup truck. Authorities seized three kilograms of explosives with a detonator, concealed in a plastic canister and “enhanced” with metal nuts.

The detained individuals have been charged under Ukrainian law for preparing a terrorist act as part of a group. They are currently in custody and face up to 12 years in prison if convicted.",34,2025-04-01 11:36:25,Well-Sourced

The State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) is investigating four people accused of orchestrating a scheme that transferred Ukrainian soldiers from combat zones to non-active units for money, with a former deputy chief of staff involved, officials said on April 1.

The defendants in a recent case allegedly charged $8,000 for a ""service"" involving influencing military decisions, with the deputy chief of staff using his extensive connections to sway officials within the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

The organized group operated covertly, utilizing detailed methods and extensive knowledge of military units to facilitate illegal actions, according to the State Bureau of Investigation (SBI). 

All suspects have been charged with abuse of influence, facing up to eight years in prison and property confiscation.

worldnews,1jwxzey,mmowiun,"My aunt married into a white farming family and her and her husband ran a large farm, with over 40 workers. All the workers had homes on the farm, a daycare, a school house, a whole community. Her and her husband considered the workers like family. 

Mugabe’s army arrived one day and took control of the centre of their farm. The “army” was really a group of drunk teenagers with machine guns. They considered the farm workers to be traitors and would frequently tie them to chairs, slap and punch them, interrogate them at length and wave guns under their noses. Or they would fully beat them up. Men, women and children. Obviously, all the farm activities had to stop because of this. The army guys would also do depraved things to the cows, like holding them down and cutting their legs off, rather than slaughtering them, which was traumatic for everyone who had raised that livestock. 

My Aunt and Uncle knew that if they left, their workers would probably be killed. So they stayed until my Aunt found new jobs for every last worker. On the last day, the army machine gunned out every window in their house, with their teenage daughter cowering inside. After that, they knew they had to leave. They managed to grab a few things and left everything behind for Australia. 

The sad thing was that the workers could have continued to keep the entire farm running without my aunt and uncle, AND they actually would have happily handed it over to them.

Heathrow chief executive Thomas Woldbye had said on Friday that the shutdown was not caused by a lack of power, but was due to the time it took to switch from the damaged substation to the other two.

The airport is under pressure from airlines to explain why flights were suspended for 18 hours after the fire in the early hours of Friday morning.

The fire started in a transformer within the electrical substation in Hayes north of Heathrow around midnight.

The airport has emergency back-up power supplies, which use diesel generators and batteries, but these only keep crucial safety systems running, such as landing equipment and runway lights.

A separate biomass power generator also provides heat and electricity to Terminal Two.
However, the National Grid is the main source of power for Heathrow.

Mr Pettigrew told the Financial Times he couldn’t remember a transformer failing to such an extent in his 30-year career in the industry.
“Losing a substation is a unique event but there were two others available. That is a level of resilience.”

A Heathrow spokeswoman said that Mr Pettigrew’s comments “confirms that this was an unprecedented incident and that it would not have been possible for Heathrow to operate uninterrupted.
“Hundreds of critical systems across the airport were required to be safely powered down and then safely and systematically rebooted,” she said.
“Given Heathrow’s size and operational complexity, safely restarting operations after a disruption of this magnitude was a significant challenge.”

On Friday, Heathrow managers decided to close the airport on the grounds of safety while they switched to the alternative National Grid supplies.
Mr Woldbye told the BBC the delay to reopening was due to the need to “reallocate” the power supply - “closing down and restarting systems which takes a long time.”
He said there were a “number of systems we have to shut down and then bring them back up and ensure they are safe.”
“It’s fuelling systems, its bridges, it’s escalators, all of these systems have to be brought back up, tested to ensure they are safe.”
He added that there were risks “of certain sizes we cannot guard ourselves against 100% and this is one of them.”

However the duration of the shutdown has infuriated airlines.
Willie Walsh, the former British Airways boss and head of the airline organisation IATA said it was a “clear planning failure by the airport” and the systems and procedures for handling power failures are now under the spotlight.

The government’s ordered a six-week investigation into the shutdown, led by the National Energy System Operator.

Mr Woldbye, who attracted criticism for claiming the airport had “come back quite fast”, said he was “happy” to answer to the prime minister.",69,2025-03-24 06:20:01,TheITMan19

worldnews,1jik6ov,mjfyyi1,"Been in this position multiple times with DataCentres. Generator/backup power is not considered reliable long term power provision - it is a backup power source for critical systems. In an extreme circumstance you could consider running on it, but realistically, you power down in a controlled manner using the generator power to do so, and power back up when power supply is restored and guaranteed. The damage to systems, and potential longer outage as a result, of a hard drop if generator power goes, is not worth the risk, and this is what has been described as being done in this case. 

I’ve had many arguments with Estates teams who say there is power, when it’s generator power only, and I’m explaining overtime to fail over and power down DC services. 

CBRE caused a large BA outage when an engineer accidentally powered off a server, and then restored power unprompted, causing a split brain - power cycles and IT infrastructure does not play well",95,2025-03-24 07:26:23,jimbobmccoy779

worldnews,1jik6ov,mjgz4ir,"Restoring power through different substations, especially in older systems like the ones we're discussing (1960s), is often a manual process, at least here in the Netherlands. It's likely that power was restored manually in this case. (Opening the interconnector from North Hyde -> Closing a different supplying interconnector connected to the same loop.)

A lot of talk about backup power. It's safe to assume that Heathrow has backup systems in place, particularly for critical safety infrastructure (a very basic example would be illuminated emergency exit signs). While my experience lies mostly in shipboard electrical systems, I suspect land-based infrastructure isn't fundamentally different in this regard:

Typically, a separate emergency distribution system is used that can be powered by an emergency generator or a UPS (essentially a large backup battery). If power is lost on the main distribution the emergency generator kicks in to supply critical systems with minimal interruption.

There is likely additional backup power capacity, which could power the main distribution, but it would require more thorough power management. I highly doubt the backup system is sized to support the entire facility at full load. They'd have to do selective load shedding, deciding what can be temporarily disabled.

This was likely the situation Heathrow faced. They probably have protocols on what to shed during an outage and when running on backup power, but I wouldn't be surprised if those procedures are outdated. In the middle of chaos, while having to safely reboot all systems and figuring out what can and can’t be shed, with thousands of unhappy passengers and limited time, it may have been safer to shut everything down and wait for the main power to return through a different substation.

Regarding the fault itself, I highly doubt there was any malicious third-party involvement as I’ve seen talked about elsewhere. The fire started in an oil-filled transformer. Unless someone deliberately applied a torch to the transformer and managed to escape before it reached a critical temperature (which seems far-fetched), I don't see any plausible way someone could have ""forced"" this failure externally.

I can't speak in detail about UK infrastructure, but here in the Netherlands, I’ve been having growing concerns about ‘new’ load profiles with older stations in mind. Much of our infrastructure was designed around an old load profile: morning peak (people waking up), midday dip (people at centralized offices with higher dimensions of transformers, cables, etc.), and evening peak (people returning home).

Nowadays, due to the half-assed addition of PV systems (by half-assed I mean that, in an effort to sell the idea of solar energy to consumers without much complaint, people with, I’d say, fairly limited technical backgrounds decided it was fine for every consumer to also become an energy supplier, without much guidance on the what or how) that midday dip is no longer present. This means that instead of a daily cycle of ‘heat up → cool down → heat up’ (and cool down during the night), we now have ‘heat up → heat up → heat up’ (and cool down during the night).

(Again, I’m not too familiar with the UK grid, so it might be that excessive current from PV installations doesn’t even reach the transformer that failed.)

Now with the conditions of multiple consecutive days of high ambient temperature and a lot of PV energy + reduced cooling cycles due to new load patterns + general high load + possible internal aging effects within the transformer, I don’t think it’s unthinkable that the oil reached combustion temperatures, especially if there was a fault or hot spot inside the transformer.",4,2025-03-24 13:01:38,Helpful_Risk722

The Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) announced that oil pumping through the Kavkazskaya oil pumping station in Russia’s Krasnodar Krai is now impossible for the foreseeable future, following its destruction by Ukrainian drones. The company continues recovery work at the facility, according to a statement from CPC’s press service, Russian media outlets report.

The company said in a statement: “After the shutdown of Kropotkinskaya station due to Ukrainian drone strikes, the expected annual transportation volume from this point was reduced, and after the destruction of Kavkazskaya station, it will be impossible in the foreseeable future. CPC is currently continuing restoration work at Kropotkinskaya station.“

The consortium noted that the attack on Kavkazskaya oil transshipment point occurred on 19 March. The facility was used for transferring oil into CPC’s pipeline system and loading at the company’s Marine Terminal as part of the CPC Blend port.

According to their data, shippers delivered at least 130,000 tons of oil monthly through Kavkazskaya. In 2024, the volume of received crude reached over 1.5 million tons.



“The actions of Ukrainian authorities destructively affect CPC’s revenue and dividends and consequently all its shareholders, including Kazakhstan and US companies,” CPC complained.

Russian publication RBC said on 24 March that firefighters were battling a blaze at Kavkazskaya that started on 19 March after the drone attack. During the assault, a pipeline between oil product tanks was damaged. One reservoir’s depressurization led to an explosion, after which another container caught fire. By the evening of 21 March, the first burning reservoir was reportedly completely extinguished.

On the night of 23 March, oil products spilled from the burning reservoir. The fire area increased to 2,000 square meters. Overnight between 23 and 24 March, one burning reservoir “collapsed” due to high temperatures, but the fire area did not increase.

Another pumping station in the area, the Kropotkinskaya station, was attacked overnight on 17 February 2025. After the February attack, Transneft reported serious damage and a reduction in oil pumping from Kazakhstan by approximately 30%.",56,2025-03-25 11:12:06,Well-Sourced

The military counterintelligence unit of the Security Service of Ukraine (SSU) has detained a Russian military intelligence agent in Sumy Oblast who was assisting Russian forces in their offensive in the Kursk area and adjusting fire on Ukrainian units.

 ""According to case materials, the traitor was recruited by the occupiers via a Telegram channel where he had posted comments in support of the Ruscists.""

Operators from Ukraine’s Unmanned Systems Forces (UUSF) tasked with detecting and intercepting Russian unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) reported via the WU Samurai Telegram channel that they had discovered a weakness in the way Russian Molniya drones operated. This allowed them to direct attacks against the enemy operators of the drones on the ground at the same time as they were destroying the UAVs.

The story was reported in the Ukrainian Militarniy website, which said the UUSF team only shared it after their Russian counterparts worked out how the Ukrainians were doing it. Even so, they didn’t divulge the technical details of the tactic other than to say it involved bringing a “small radio reconnaissance device” close to the enemy drone, carried on their own interceptor, as it homed in on the Molniya.

Once the “data” had been extracted, this provided the coordinates of the Russian drone operators control post, by which a Ukrainian first-person view (FPV) kamikaze drone was tasked to take them out.

90% of cannon barrels for Caesar, the wheeled self-propelled howitzer produced by Franco-German defense group KNDS, are currently being delivered to Ukraine, Le Monde reports. The Caesar is among the primary artillery systems used by the Ukrainian military. The rise in output reflects a major shift in French defense manufacturing, especially in the Bourges region in central France.

Bourges reindustrialized after long-term decline. Bourges lost nearly 3,000 industrial jobs between 1991 and 2001 due to site closures by GIAT, KNDS’s predecessor. Local officials such as Mayor Yann Galut and Bourges Plus president Irène Félix acknowledged the dramatic shift in fortunes. “We are living through an extraordinary turning point,” Galut told Le Monde.

Before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, KNDS produced just two Caesar units per month, according to Le Monde. That number has since tripled to six, with a goal of reaching twelve monthly by the end of 2025. Additionally, KNDS has doubled production of 155 mm artillery shells at its La Chapelle-Saint-Ursin facility, targeting 100,000 units per year.

Additionally, Bourges-based facilities of another arms producer, MBDA, have significantly accelerated its output of Mistral and Aster anti-air missiles, which are also supplied to Ukraine.

Beyond MBDA and KNDS, major defense firms like Thales, Safran, Mecachrome, and Michelin have ramped up operations, supported by over 100 subcontractors across the region.",50,2025-04-22 12:28:56,Well-Sourced

It’s a good thing, at least, that there were no air raid sirens.

> We thank all the media, podcasters, bloggers, and everyone sharing the truth about what is happening. Instead of broadcasting religious service from Moscow, the focus should be on pressuring Moscow to genuinely commit to a full ceasefire and to maintain it for at least 30 days after Easter – to give diplomacy a real chance.

There were a total of 1,355 cases of Russian shelling, 713 of which involved heavy weaponry. The Russians also used FPVs 673 times.

> In practice, across all main frontline directions, Russia has failed to uphold its own promise of ceasefire. And almost an entire day wasn’t enough for Russia to respond to our Ukrainian proposal for a full ceasefire – starting now, from Easter, and lasting 30 days.

Ukraine proposes to cease any strikes using long-range drones and missiles on civilian infrastructure for a period of at least 30 days, with the possibility of extension. If Russia does not agree to such a step, it will be proof that it intends to continue doing only those things which destroy human lives and prolong the war.

worldnews,1jyq21j,mn3ozq2,"That UK intelligence update on casualties is damning for Russia. They estimate 138k Russian casualties in 2025 which is a rate of 1340 per day. If that rate continues for the entire year that would mean Russia would sustain 489,000 casualties in 2025. I usually don't like to draw straight linear lines and extrapolate but I think there is a good chance the Russian casualties are in the 400-500k range unless something major changes.

Overall Russia NEEDS to be on the offensive to keep the narrative that they are an unstoppable force so they can't afford to quit attacking which would lower their casualty rate. Additionally they also got a huge surge of volunteers recently so they probably don't feel the need to be particularly conservative either especially when battlefield successes can be used to reinforce their narrative in western capitols. We have seen US aid declining and it will likely continue to decline before ending entirely but at the same time European manufacturing of weapons will be world's ahead of where it was in 2021 by this summer meanwhile Ukraine can now produce millions of drones per year. It's now feasible for Ukraine to send multiple drones at individual advancing Russian troops. At the same time Russian armor is becoming rarer and rarer so Russian assaults are becoming more infantry heavy. Less armor means less of an ability to keep infantry alive and the pressure on supply lines means it's harder to get necessary resupply to them. If the US is not committed to European security then Ukraine becomes more important as a replacement for the US so European countries are unlikely to stop arming Ukraine either. As long as Russian demands equate to ""near total Ukrainian surrender"" and Russia is not having a lot of battlefield success then Ukraine has no incentive to accept those demands. What follows is lots of hard fighting with lots of Russian casualties. Both total and partial victory seem to remain on the table for both Ukraine and Russia.",59,2025-04-14 18:19:26,socialistrob
