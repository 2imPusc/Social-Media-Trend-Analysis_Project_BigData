movies,1jw9yk6,mmhxggt,"This is the most tone deaf review I’ve ever read. 

The ethics vs morals theme is a joke. It’s not meant to be a serious philosophical musing. McAllister ignoring his friend’s blatantly wrong act while at the same time lecturing pretentiously on the difference between ethics and morals is satire. Novotny’s actions are absolutely grooming and statutory rape. It’s an adult teacher preying on their student. It’s not ambiguous. McAllister arguing for ambiguity makes him a villain. He must do these mental gymnastics to convince himself he’s righteous. That’s the joke. 

Why did you feel the need to comment on the attractiveness of the female actresses? Very off putting.

It was a brief scene and it really helped define her pain and desire to help Newt.  I know some can argue that it wasn't necessary to over explain Ripley's fierce maternal instincts, but I think it helped the overall story to have that scene.

I suspect in part the sequence was cut because -and I hate to get so blunt here- it looked pretty awful.  It felt like Cameron pushed the already meager Aliens budget as far as he could and that sequence looked pretty dreadful compared to so many others in the movie.

movies,1juct3f,mm2d7u1,"A Goofy Movie is one of my all time favorites. Not just because it's just a solid heartfelt story with plenty of funny goofs, but because of its place in my life.

This doc does a great job at showing the small team that put it together, how much it meant to them, alludes to how painful it was when it released to commercial quietness, and gives some fun behind the scenes from filming.

This one isn't a Disney juggernaut of grand scale. It was an afterthought at the time as Disney focused on bigger things. This is all important to note because the film was made by people. Made by people who wanted the film to mean something and put their whole self into making it. This documentary does a great job at conveying that.

Finally, the last 15 or so minutes are dedicated to the people like me. People who watch it and yeah, they like the movie, but more importantly they relate to it, either as an empathetic person, a parent or a child. It's always reassuring to see that not only can you relate to the story being told on film, but also to other people through that relation to the film. This is anything and everything that I could hope to get from new content around A Goofy Movie. Please don't remake it.

It's also pretty funny that there's not a peep about the sequel, which I do enjoy, but obviously it doesn't have the pieces of the puzzle to really latch onto over time.",17,2025-04-08 17:14:25,UberCamm2
movies,1juct3f,mm2neh2,"*A Goofy Movie* was a childhood classic that I regularly watched whenever it aired on Disney Channel. Different from the romance-driven fairy tales the studio was producing at the time, *Goofy Movie* was refreshingly different, being a John Hughes-inspired road trip comedy with musical numbers thrown in for good measure. Released after the massive success of *The Lion King*, *A Goofy Movie* was released without fanfare and failed to impress critics. It did well on home video, I believe, and garnered an online fandom thanks to the emergence of YouTube. During the website's early years, fans reenacted the song ""After Today"" that became a viral hit. 

*Not Just a Goof* reflects the cult classic the film has become as this was an independently-produced documentary directed by Eric Kimelton (who is the nephew of *A Goofy Movie* director Kevin Lima) and Christopher Ninness. The documentary shares some delightful hand-drawn pencil animation, detailing what happened during production. There's also vintage footage of the production team and the voice cast recording their lines, highlighting the  creative challenges that shaped this beloved film. There's no juicy gossip of note, though thankfully, cooler heads prevailed when Jeffrey Katzenberg proposed having Goofy speak with a normal voice than his familiar cartoonish voice. 

There was a lot of heart put into the making of this documentary, though the direct-to-video sequel *An Extremely Goofy Movie* was unfortunately ignored. I liked that film growing up, too. Still, it was heartwarming to see the reevaluation *A Goofy Movie* has received and how prevalent the cult fandom has grown online.",6,2025-04-08 18:01:34,ChrisCinema

I really enjoyed this movie, although it was tough to watch at times. As someone with an addict in her family, Sandra Bullock's character really hit home. Her immaturity, the jokey was she downplays her actions, the self-deprecation, the sister who went through the same trauma and managed to turn out stable. It all was extremely relatable for me, unfortunately. One of the toughest bits is when the sister confronts her about the things Sandra Bullock's character said at her wedding, which Bullock's character doesn't even remember because she was so wasted. I'm sure many of us with addicts in our families are familiar with waiting for apologies that will never come because the addict doesn't remember half the offensive shit they've said or done to hurt you. 

The fake soap opera and the always delightful Alan Tudyk lightened things up quite a bit. The side romance with Viggo Mortensen is an interesting enough fun little distraction. 

The movie is nothing amazing, but it is a solid little drama.",3,2025-04-18 12:57:50,CinemaSideBySides

The story overall doesn't really leave much of an impact though, despite pretty much all of the cast delivering solid performances. I'll admit that I watched mostly out of interest in Sadie Sink's roles post-Stranger Things, and whilst she delivers her usual excellent level of acting ability to the screen, it's her incredible vocal talent that really stole the show for me - despite some of the songs given to her being somewhat forgettable.",6,2025-03-30 02:58:38,ChunkeeMunkee3001

When this teaser trailer for *The Master* came out in 2012, it was the most excited I've ever been for an upcoming movie. It laid just enough groundwork for me to guess the tone of the film and yet have no idea what the overall story was about. It did not even include the majority of its cast, just Joaquin in some early moments from the film.

The trailer was successful. I anticipated the movie so much, that when I eventually saw it, it was a mystery revealed, and I was still mystified by it, but thoroughly entranced. Since I have watched it over ten times in the thirteen years since, and my appreciation increases with every viewing. It is my favorite film, and I watch and love an insane number of movies.

movies,1jud61p,mm1ps01,"I agree somewhat with the assessment here and I feel a lot of this could have been remedied with significantly better editing which IMO Is the WEAKEST part of this film. The pacing makes absolutely no sense and we're jumping through in some cases multiple years between scenes and trying to catch up with wtf is going on that the tone of taking it seriously is hard to process, ie this movie should've 100% been a campy dark comedy because the more serious stuff has absolutely no time to be fleshed out 

For example, in the film Gucci in the 90s is portrayed as being this gawdy/lower tier fashion house and they wanna turn it around as they're just falling apart. Well shit, no one wants to design for them; but wait hold on there's this guy from Texas that we can bring in since none of the European designers want to do it? Cue Tom Ford and arguably one of the funnier introductions (is he a mechanic?) and then in the case of about 10 minutes Tom Ford shows up, makes the iconic fashion show, now serious scene ensues, Tom Ford leaves the room and is never seen from again.

Idk how they managed to Mary Sue Tom Ford in this case but the breakneck pace of this Texan coming in and literally saving the house of Gucci then just disappears right after sort of encapsulates the movie as a whole: very little actual character development and instead there's just a series of scenes where there's not enough time to flesh things out and not much organized progression which is insane considering how LONG this movie is.",3,2025-04-08 15:19:07,MrT-1000

1. I really liked the movie when it came out but today, 80 years almost after the end of ww2 with anyone involved  pushing 100, it must seem dated to many. It came out half a century ago when Mengele was actually still alive whereas today he would be 120 or something. Peck plays him well -- as a terrible man as Mengele certainly was.

2. I think people will enjoy the book (with the same ""dated"" warning). A slight spoiler: >!I feel the movie made a strange choice vs the book: The nazi hunter and Mengele meet in the living room of the ""father"" of the Hitler clone whom Mengele has shot. The nazi hunter asks if the man is still alive and in the book, Mengele says something like, ""Sure, he's in the kitchen making us sandwiches."" The movie has Mengele say ""He's making us cocktails."" -- I think ""sandwiches"" is much funnier.!<",2,2025-04-15 11:32:52,relesabe

You blow on the barrel not just to get rid of smoke to check the barrel (they produced much more than modern guns), but also to make sure it doesn't have any embers inside of it that might make reloading dangerous. So it's likely just an anachronism carried over from stories about gunfights with the victorious shooters blowing on their guns. I've also heard of people blowing into breech loaded rifles in order to reduce the amount of residue that settles in the chamber but that's not really the cliche. ",50,2025-04-17 16:46:36,Ordinaryundone

There was also. ""‘fanning the hammer"" which and article about gunfighting in 1889 said “it is doubtful if anybody yet has succeeded in firing six consecutive balls into the same township by fanning the hammer.”

Back in 1930 Wyatt Earp biographer Stuart Lake quoted Wyatt’s blunt views about gun handling: “In all my life as a frontier peace officer, I did not know a really proficient gunfighter who had anything but contempt for the gun fanner, or the man who literally shot from the hip.…From my experience…I can only support the opinion advanced by the men who gave me my most valuable instruction in fast and accurate shooting—which was that the gun fanner and the hip shooter stood small chance to live against a man who…took his time and pulled the trigger once.”",0,2025-04-17 16:34:05,Captain_Aware4503

He dealt with it all so bravely, his voice was taken and he still joked about it.  Things like that show you how strong a person is.  It’s just sad he deteriorated further.",4,2025-04-12 20:30:15,Rski765

That's a good thing in a way, since I was never conceited or cocky, but it definitely held me back. Had I had more confidence I might have actually landed some breakout roles and become a known actor rather than all these minor forgettable parts that I did in mostly B movies. 

If you're wondering what I thought at the time, well, I didn't. I just didn't watch anything I was in. I think the fact that they were minor roles in B movies meant I wasn't proud enough to watch them.

movies,1jwc8mb,mmheya6,"Wrote about this before, so might as well write about it again…

*The Outfit* is an adaptation of the third novel in the “Parker” series.  Written by “Richard Stark”, the pen name for Donald Westlake, the series focused on the character of Parker, a hardened sociopathic criminal who will not let anything stand in the way of getting what he wants.

The novel, and by turn movie, is almost a second/concluding part to the first novel in the Parker series, *The Hunter*.  That novel was first adapted starring Lee Marvin in 1967 as *Point Blank*.  Years later it would be adapted again with Mel Gibson in *Payback*.  Other novels in the series were also adapted and if you’re curious, check ‘em out!

Funny thing about most of the movies, though: During his lifetime Donald Westlake forbid the studios to use the “Parker” name for the main character.  Thus, Lee Marvin in *Point Blank* is called “Walker”.  Robert Duvall in *The Outfit* is called “Machlin”.  Mel Gibson in *Payback* is “Porter”.  But they’re all, ultimately, Parker and it’s curious that after Westlake’s passing Jason Statham starred in yet another adaptation of one of the novels but finally the character -and movie!- were called *Parker*.

Why did Westlake not want the name used?  Supposedly he grew to not like having called the character that name.  He stated, rather humorously, that he was in mortal fear of one day having to write “Parker parked his car”…!

Anyway, check out *Point Blank* if you haven’t already.  IMHO, the very best adaptation of any of Westlake’s novels!",7,2025-04-11 00:23:41,Corrosive-Knights

movies,1jji7ec,mjo0s9g,"The ending is not bad because of its themes or message.. that's a misrepresentation.


It's bad because it's a failed execution. 


The way the movie tells it's story and how it's edited, very moment to moment, doesn't indicate that such weird jumps will happen.. the movie feels like is building to something, and then it doesn't. 


You jump to the corner of the ending of a battle, then you jump to a very dramatic scene where Tom is carrying the girl.. who then just stands up and walks away.. then his kid show up out of fucking nowhere and most of those character arcs, that were the center of the film, don't get a satisfying resolution... 


Then you shoehorn a narration to explain what happened.. which is tonally jarring with the rest of the film... and it ends. 


A quiet, more contamplative ending requires even more time and effort.. but Spielberg does the opposite. He rushes through it and that's what most people feel about the ending.. even if they can't point to why.. ""it felt rushed"". 


People talk about how everyone wanted a big battle, but that is not exactly truth. Feel like the Spielberg was bored by the lack of a big battle and then had no more interest in sticking around. 


In any case.. when you have entire movie theaters around the world going.. wait what? Is that it?.. it's clear you did something wrong, regardless of your intention. ",4,2025-03-25 15:18:44,stenebralux

And whether or not the son comes back at the end has *no bearing* or weight on that awful moment of choice, when Ray has to choose between stopping his nearly grown son from making a headstrong choice and joining the fight or rescuing his much younger daughter from being whisked away by strangers in what is effectively a warzone.

It’s a terrible choice for a father to make, and I think Cruise plays it so well. I love that moment when he realizes, like so many fathers who were unable to stop their sons from going to war, that he has to let him go. He’s asking Robbie to help him with his sister, but it has to be on him. He’s the father. And there’s finally a moment of understanding between the two men.

That Robbie shows up at the end doesn’t invalidate any of that growth. It just gives the family a happier ending.",2,2025-03-25 15:56:09,Dottsterisk

movies,1jmof6x,mkdb22f,"This is a tough question to answer without going back to older films that established the tropes and conventions of modern filmmaking. It's your choice if you want to do that, that's less in my wheelhouse.

I can't comment on Spanish dubs, but if your parents are religious, the Prince of Egypt is an excellent animated film about Moses and the 10 plagues. If they already know the biblical story, the movie will be easy to understand, and it introduces them to American animation and musicals.

In a similar vein, a historical drama or sword-and-sandal epic may be fairly accessible, depending on their knowledge. I'm a big fan of Gladiator and Monty Python's Holy Grail, one introduces action and one leans heavily into comedy. Other options include Braveheart, Ben-Hur, and Lawrence of Arabia, but those may be a bit long and boring for your family.

I'd also recommend any film that's contained to a limited space and cast for accessibility. The first that come to mind are Fences, Breakfast Club, and maybe Rear Window. Ex Machina also fills this category but may be a bit 'out there'. I also group Lady Bird in with this vibe if not this category.

If you'd like to go into foreign films that may not have good dubbed options, Bicycle Thieves is an excellent older Italian film that's both easily understandable and heartbreaking. If you want something a bit more modern, La Haine is a French film about young men in an immigrant community. I took a film course at my community college and those were two that stuck with me.

The reveal is important for that, but it isn't as fun as the adventure that comes before.

*Mickey was born in the early 1950s and his earliest memories from primary school involve crime. His father taught him how to fight, and opportunities to make enough money to go to the cinema presented themselves to him. As he entered adulthood, the trouble escalated.*

*Across four decades, Mickey was in and out of prison. Then a chance meeting with the filmmaker Guy Richie, and a further encounter with the screenwriter Tony Jordan, led Mickey into the world of storytelling and the big screen.*

*Dr Sally Tilt and Dr Kerensa Hocken are forensic psychologists who work in prisons. Their job is to help people who have committed crimes to understand the harm they’ve caused, identify why it happened and work out how to make changes to prevent further harm after they’ve been released.*

*In Behind the Crime, they take the time to understand the life of someone whose crimes have led to harm and prison.*

*Through this extended interview, we get to the heart of his behaviour and discover that there are two Mickeys.*",7,2025-04-07 12:23:29,invalidreddit

But what I love the most is the way it inverts the idea of the super-know-it-all P.I. found in the Chandler and Hammett novels.  Hackman’s Harry Moseby is, to put it *very* bluntly, a *terrible* private investigator.  He is a nice guy, mind you, and he tries very hard, but unlike Phillip Marlowe or Sam Spade, he’s lost throughout the film and barely understands what’s going on around him.

The movie clues you in on this really early on (not a big spoiler as it happens in the first few minutes of the film) when, by total chance, he discovers his wife is cheating on him.

Think about it: He’s a private investigator.  His wife has been cheating on him and *he had no clue*.

Through the course of the film he stumbles around and discovers things mostly by accident but never really puts everything together.  He’s no Inspector Clouseau, he’s a really decent guy and, as I said, tries really hard, but he’s just no good at his job.

The whole thing about the famous chess move Moseby talks about midway through the film is a fascinating insight into the way he ticks.",1,2025-04-03 01:39:17,Corrosive-Knights

We had this on VHS when I was a teenager and I had/have a ridiculous crush on Jenna Elfman so I’ve seen this movie probably upwards of 30 times. It’s one of those movies that are harmless enough that you’d let a kid watch it a bunch, yet under the surface there is an extremely horny love story and I was definitely picking up on that as a kid, but it’s also got this Nora Ephron-esque New York gloss over it that feels so pre-9/11. Crazy that famously difficult and artistic Edward Norton directed this, and it’s certainly not on the level of movies like it such as Harry Met Sally, Crossing Delancey, or Moonstruck, but this is a solid 6/10 good time.

movies,1jxqsxb,mmsyc3e,this movie felt like a movie that characters in a movie watch. also felt like the editors were deathly afraid of keeping the camera on someone who wasn’t talking so the whole movie is like cut cut cut cut cut and it kinda hurt my eyes,9,2025-04-12 22:13:21,jeepdiggle

Meghann Fahy made the film.

movies,1jxqsxb,mmsz1px,"This was kind of a great short film stretched out into 90 minutes. The story was out there in the first few minutes and then we had to wait through the same sort of machinations over and over until the plot finally heaved forward. I didn’t mind, wasn’t really expecting much, and the people were nice to look at. But it didn’t really make for a whole movie.",4,2025-04-12 22:17:40,cutandcover

movies,1jxqsxb,mnlauag,"It's fun enough if you don't take it too seriously. I don't think it's exactly worth the tickets they're charging nowadays (if this were 2004 ticket prices I'd say absolutely go buy a ticket).

I do agree with the poster that it's more reminiscent of a Lifetime movie. It's a little smarter and better shot, but at the same time it also feels lower budget than Lifetime thrillers in some ways (there are only 2 settings in the entire film, aside from a brief car sequence)

There are so few of these types of ""woman in trouble"" thrillers in theatres anymore. It is not as good as Double Jeopardy imo, which is still the Queen of this type of genre.",3,2025-04-17 14:34:36,bravetailor
movies,1jxqsxb,mno61pt,"It was suspenseful but very predictable. They purposely make everyone an obvious suspect so you can't figure out who it is. Overall, a decent film.

movies,1jv91gs,mm8dh64,I am guessing the low ratings are at least in part by expecting a different type of movie.

movies,1k4y2pr,moec0k9,"Avery becomes DA, earns big money, sends AJ to expensive NY private school. His manner of speaking is peculiar to those schools. Jayden Smith mumbles in exactly the same manner. In Place Beyond the Pines, it's the character's manner of talking, presumably to emphasize the rich kid, poor kid nature of his friendship with Jason  

They're just two kids who become friends. Avery can't tell AJ why he should stay away from Jason without admitting his own history - cold-blooded murder of Jason's father, and the subsequent coverup. If the boys' friendship uncovers their common history, AJ is likely to become aware that his father lied about the murder in order to become DA and candidate for NY Attorney General",3,2025-04-22 08:12:11,pop-1988

movies,1k0w370,mnhebfn,"I liked it, thought it was the best of that trilogy.  I wasn't very big on that trilogy, so the fact that it didn't strictly follow the story wasn't a problem for me.  I liked the way it defied the audience's desires - not giving you Michael but instead cribbing from *Christine*.  I think overall Green and Co. knew they didn't have much of a story if they only stretched out the Laurie/Michael confrontation to yet another movie, so they decided to try something different.  (Plus, the idea of someone imitating Michael is similar to an idea I had for a story a few years ago, so I liked it on that level.)",4,2025-04-16 21:49:45,Video_Word

movies,1k0w370,mnk2rm4,"I actually enjoyed the second one despite general consensus. But this third one was a real bore. As you said, it's because it's the third in a trilogy that expectations are there. Michael was just a background character through most of the movie and after his kick-ass finale of the second one, he is transformed into a wuss in this one! What doesn't help is we're introduced to Cory in this final movie. If he was introduced either in the first or second one, it would have made sense for his arc to end in this one. But introducing him as the main antagonist and then killing him off all in the final movie where Michael is supposed to be the main antagonist is a crime against Halloween movies.

As you said, if this wasn't a Halloween movie and Cory was copying any other serial killer, it might have been a more successful movie. As a finale to Halloween it sucks! They've done Michael a real injustice here.",1,2025-04-17 09:40:40,wisperingdeth
