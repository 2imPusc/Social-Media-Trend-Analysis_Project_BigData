Peals of fragile thunder

keeping time

Recall the days that still are to come

some sing blue.

Hang your heart on laughing willow

stray down to the water,

deep sea of love

beneath the sweet calm face of the sea

swift undertow.

Life may be sweeter for this, I don’t know,

See how it feels in the end.

May Lady Lullaby sing plainly for you

soft, strong, sweet and true.

Cloud hands reaching from a rainbow

tapping at the window,

touch your hair

So swift and bright

strange figures of light

float in air.

Who can stop what must arrive now?

Something new is waiting to be born

Dark as the night you’re still by my side

shine inside.

Gone are the days we stopped to decide

where we should go, we just ride.

Gone are the broken eyes we saw through in dreams

gone, both dream and lie.

Life may be sweeter for this, I don’t know,

Feels like it might be all right,

While Lady Lullaby sings plainly through you

Love still rings true.

midnight on a carrousel ride,

reaching for the gold ring

down inside.

Never could reach it,

just slips away

but I try.”

you could get only so far, regionally, by working hard,  creating great material, building a fan base.

To make it big, you needed to get the right amount of support from your label, media buyers at chains like Walmart and other gatekeepers. 

Which means if you didn't fit a premade format/genre; you either changed to fit or you missed out. This is related to why ""selling out"" was a much more relevant concept; because it was the only viable way for uncategorized bands to make it. 

The Tubes might not have been huge, but they would have been way more successful on their terms, today.
The last 10 years of the Flaming Lips, is an apt example.

music,1jwn69e,mmnek5c,"When I was at school in the late 90s, and not exactly from a wealthy family, some other people at school we're talking about going to see some pop band for £50. I decided at that point i'd probaly never be able to afford a gig, fast foraward to being 18 and I find out that plenty of places had gigs that cost £10 or less and that they were a lot better than a shitty pop band.

Edit: I should add the reason I thought that because if a shit band was £50 how much would a good or great band be like Deep Purple, Slade or Sweet? (bands I was a big fan of in the late 90s.) 

I have paid more than that for larger bands but rarely is it over £30, usually I go to festivals for larger bands but i'm seeing Iron Maiden in June. The ticket, IIRC, was £120 for general standing, I can't exactly recall and the hotel has pushed it close to £200.

I would rather pay £20 to see Tailgunner\* than £50 to see Madonna (or whatever she charges these days).

Tame Impala is one of the most popular psych rock bands right now and he’s produced a lot of songs for top hip hop and r&b performers.

Examples: skeletons by Travis Scott, sundress by A$AP Rocky, tomorrow by Kali Uchis,  Back together by Sza (this is a leak), violent crimes by Kanye

Most famously Rihanna covered their song new person, same old mistakes on anti!!!

I you want rock with strong/soulful vocals I’d go with paramore or  Alabama shakes.

Some good classic psych rock w strong vocals, Jefferson airplane and Jimi Hendrix 

And this may be a reach, but I’d also consider Radiohead and 9 inch nails since they’re both more contemporary and have influenced modern producing a LOT.",18,2025-04-01 12:47:24,BlackDahliaLama

*From Perry Farrell assuming Green Day was a boy band to Courtney Love throwing punches, we look at the wildest moments of the decade-defining traveling festival.*

Before Lollapalooza became just another giant festival, it was a culture-shaking Nineties traveling carnival that helped define the thing we used to call “alternative.” Key moments in the careers of Pearl Jam, Nine Inch Nails, Ice-T, Green Day, Rage Against the Machine, Courtney Love, and many more played out on its stages, as chronicled in the excellent new oral-history book Lollapalooza: The Uncensored Story of Alternative Rock’s Wildest Festival.

In the new episode of Rolling Stone Music Now, authors Tom Beaujour and Richard Bienstock break down some of the wildest Lolla stories from their book.

Normally they would talk a lot about their discoveries, where to buy them etc... I would then go downtown to very niche stores that sold imports.

Often, if you get a very knowledgable person at the counter they would then show you some other music you might like in that genre. 

My other way to discover music is that I had in my area a lot of stores specialized in trading used CD's. Again, the people behind the counter were amazing and they led me to some very fine discoveries through exchanges. 

Honestly they were pretty eager to help. Most of them were young and into alternative, industrial and metal music. They need people swapping cd's for their business so they would make sure you had to come back to hear the next new gem. 

Bonus point, they would also let me know about small bands playing in pubs and recommending I check them out.

I often work with an AV team putting on conferences all over North America and Europe. One of the AV guys is a big DBT fan, and he knows I am too, and we're down in a hotel ballroom at 6 am doing soundchecks and what-have-you, and so he's playing some of their stuff while he's checking whatever it is sound guys check early in the morning.

""Hey, want to hear something cool?"" He asks. Of course I say yes, and he plays a song that I've heard many, many times before. ""Hear that kind of whine in there?"" He asks.

""Yeah?"" I say. It's something that when someone points it out to you, you can't not hear it.

""I know they did this song in the studio in one take, because that sound is a mistake. That's a pedal effect a lot of guitarists use to dirty-up their sound at the start of a piece, but you're supposed to turn it off once the band gets going. They forgot to do that here. They must have liked this take enough to use it over the objections of the audio engineer in the booth.""

""Why? What's the big deal?"" I ask.

""It's exactly the same noise speakers make when they're about to blow.""

Within ten seconds of explaining that to me, the AV guy's boss —a very AV tech savvy guy himself— walks into the hotel ballroom and loses his goddamn mind. ""What is that? Is that our shit? Shut it down! Shut it all down right now!"" He's thinking all of their equipment is about to destroy itself, and they've got only a few seconds to kill the power and figure out what's gone wrong.

So I'm laughing my head off, and the AV guy is trying to explain through my laughter that it's on the album he's playing, and the boss is not calming down. ""Who the fuck would put out an album with that sound on it?""

I'm so tired

Of your lies

And the evil things

You're doing behind my back

Are there crimes

That you have never committed?

I doubt it, sometimes I wonder

When will you die?

You're insane

You are bad

You wreck everything you touch

And you're a sociopath

But there's one thing

That everyone's wondering

When will you die?",7,2025-04-18 05:29:08,exmojo

Black Sabbath- Paranoid. Truly one of the greatest albums ever recorded. 

Metallica- Master of Puppets. Their first two albums were already legendary, and somehow this one went even harder. I still wonder how different things might have turned if Cliff hadn’t died. 

Public Enemy- Fear of an All Black Planet. Chuck and Flava never sounded better. This album is slick, witty and somehow still timely some 30+ years later.",23,2025-04-04 13:24:14,Mental_Difference424

This performance highlights the band's influence in the late '80s and early '90s power pop scene, which was characterized by catchy melodies and a retro sound reminiscent of the British Invasion.

I would pick the new kind of music either based on what I stumbled upon by reading or by asking myself *what genres do I know exist but have no clue about?*.
