1jqc8gy,reddit,New Python lock file format will specify dependencies - Your thoughts?,"Python’s builders have accepted a proposal to create a universal lock file format for Python projects that would specify dependencies, enabling installation reproducibility in a Python environment.

Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) 751, accepted March 31, aims to create a new file format for specifying dependencies that is machine-generated and human-readable. Installers consuming the file should be able to calculate what to install without needing dependency resolution at install-time, according to the proposal.

Currently no standard exists to create an immutable record, such as a lock file, that specifies what direct and indirect dependencies should be installed into a Python virtual environment, the proposal states. There have been at least five well-known solutions to the problem in the community, including PDM, pip freeze, pip-tools, Poetry, and uv, but these tools vary in what locking scenarios are supported. ”By not having compatibility and interoperability it fractures tooling around lock files where both users and tools have to choose what lock file format to use upfront, making it costly to use/switch to other formats,” the proposal says.

Human readability of the file format enables contents of the file to be audited, to make sure no undesired dependencies are included in the lock file. The file format also is designed to not require a resolver at install time. This simplifies reasoning about what would be installed when consuming a lock file. It should also lead to faster installs, which are much more frequent than creating a lock file.

The format has not yet been associated with a specific release of Python, but is guidance for tooling going forward. Actual adoption remains open-ended. Acceptance of the format is full and final, not provisional. The universal format has been the subject of an estimated four years of discussion and design.",2025-04-03 07:32:53,programming,programming,technology,Technology,[],0,203,86,,0.89,https://www.infoworld.com/article/3951038/new-python-lock-file-format-will-specify-dependencies.html,Choobeen

1jop2wi,reddit,Bold move by European Commission towards the memory safe language Seed7,"The European Commission issued a strategy paper about memory safety.
They propose a European concept of memory safety. They introduce
categories of memory safety and the categories are summarized in the
memory-safety levels 1 to 5. Language features are categorized regarding
their support of memory safety.

They introduced the terms wild-pointer (which is essentially a C pointer)
and checked-pointer. Inside the category of checked-pointers they further
distinguish between ones which can be NULL and ones that cannot be NULL.
So Java references count as checked-pointers which can be NULL.
Interesting fact: Although C++ references cannot be NULL they count as
wild-pointers, because there are ways to cast a C++ pointer to a reference.

Regarding unsafe-parts and inline-assembly they state that they are
overused which compromises safety. They made a study about languages
with unsafe-parts and inline-assembly. The study found out: About 30% of
all Rust crates incorporate some use of unsafe Rust. The study also states:
70% of Rust developers are calling unsafe code through foreign functions.

In their language evaluation the language Seed7 is the clear winner.
It is the clear winner because it is memory safe and has no unsafe parts.
As a consequence the European Commission proposes the use of Seed7
in many areas of software development. There will be a Europe-wide
research fund to facilitate the use of Seed7 in more areas. Companies will
have tax reductions if they rewrite programs or libraries in Seed7.

This is seen as long term commitment of the European Union to improve
software quality and to make Europe independent in the software industry.

1k4hg9j,reddit,How does OAuth work: ELI5?,"So I was reading about OAuth to learn it and have created this explanation. It's basically a few of the best I have found merged together and rewritten in big parts. I have also added a _super short summary_ and a _code example_. Maybe it helps one of you :-)

# OAuth Explained

## The Basic Idea

Let’s say LinkedIn wants to let users import their Google contacts.

One obvious (but terrible) option would be to just ask users to enter their Gmail email and password directly into LinkedIn. But giving away your actual login credentials to another app is a huge security risk.

OAuth was designed to solve exactly this kind of problem.

Note: So OAuth solves an authorization problem! Not an authentication problem. See [here][ref1] for the difference.

## Super Short Summary

- User clicks “Import Google Contacts” on LinkedIn
- LinkedIn redirects user to Google’s OAuth consent page
- User logs in and approves access
- Google redirects back to LinkedIn with a one-time code
- LinkedIn uses that code to get an access token from Google
- LinkedIn uses the access token to call Google’s API and fetch contacts

## More Detailed Summary

Suppose LinkedIn wants to import a user’s contacts from their Google account.

1. LinkedIn sets up a Google API account and receives a client_id and a client_secret
   - So Google knows this client id is LinkedIn
2. A user visits LinkedIn and clicks ""Import Google Contacts""
3. LinkedIn redirects the user to Google’s authorization endpoint:
   https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?client_id=12345&redirect_uri=https://linkedin.com/oauth/callback&scope=contacts

- client_id is the before mentioned client id, so Google knows it's LinkedIn
- redirect_uri is very important. It's used in step 6
- in scope LinkedIn tells Google how much it wants to have access to, in this case the contacts of the user

4. The user will have to log in at Google
5. Google displays a consent screen: ""LinkedIn wants to access your Google contacts. Allow?"" The user clicks ""Allow""
6. Google generates a one-time authorization code and redirects to the URI we specified: redirect_uri. **It appends the one-time code as a URL parameter**.
   - So the URL could be https://linkedin.com/oauth/callback?code=one_time_code_xyz
7. Now, LinkedIn makes a server-to-server request (not a redirect) to Google’s token endpoint and receive an access token (and ideally a refresh token)
8. **Finished**. Now LinkedIn can use this access token to access the user’s Google contacts via Google’s API

---

**Question:**
_Why not just send the access token in step 6?_

**Answer:** To make sure that the requester is actually LinkedIn. So far, all requests to Google have come from the user’s browser, with only the client_id identifying LinkedIn. Since the client_id isn’t secret and could be guessed by an attacker, Google can’t know for sure that it's actually LinkedIn behind this. In the next step, LinkedIn proves its identity by including the client_secret in a server-to-server request.

## Security Note: Encryption

OAuth 2.0 does **not** handle encryption itself. It relies on HTTPS (SSL/TLS) to secure sensitive data like the client_secret and access tokens during transmission.

## Security Addendum: The state Parameter

The state parameter is critical to prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. It’s a unique, random value generated by the third-party app (e.g., LinkedIn) and included in the authorization request. Google returns it unchanged in the callback. LinkedIn verifies the state matches the original to ensure the request came from the user, not an attacker.

## OAuth 1.0 vs OAuth 2.0 Addendum:

OAuth 1.0 required clients to cryptographically sign every request, which was more secure but also much more complicated. OAuth 2.0 made things simpler by relying on HTTPS to protect data in transit, and using bearer tokens instead of signed requests.

## Code Example: OAuth 2.0 Login Implementation

Below is a standalone Node.js example using Express to handle OAuth 2.0 login with Google, storing user data in a SQLite database.

```javascript
const express = require(""express"");
const axios = require(""axios"");
const sqlite3 = require(""sqlite3"").verbose();

Compilers, though, are strict — one semicolon error, and it’s dead. That gap makes AI struggle with tough coding tasks.

Funny thing: AI was supposed to replace us, but we’re still fixing its wrong code. Now folks are coming up with “rules” for writing better prompts — so exact they’re like code to get code.

It shows only the branches and commits that are active in your workflow, so you’re not buried in noise. Uncommitted changes appear just like `git status`, and y**ou can run Git actions like committing, rebasing, resolving conflicts, and managing branches — all from the UI.**

When paired with [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/), it also shows PR status, CI results, and comment counts inline.

It’s inspired by Meta’s Smartlog (from the Sapling source control system), but adapted for Git.

1jlsyzq,reddit,WebAssembly: SpecTec has been adopted,"Two weeks ago, the Wasm Community Group voted to adopt SpecTec for authoring future editions of the Wasm spec. In this post, I’ll shed some light on what SpecTec is, what it helps with, and why it takes Wasm to a new level of rigor and assurance that is unprecedented when it comes to language standards.

One feature that sets Wasm apart from other mainstream programming technologies is that it comes with a complete formalization: [...]

This was a huge leap forward, because the practical state of language specifications is basically stuck in the 1960s: most language standards, even new ones, are still defined by some basic grammar notation for their syntax (and sometimes not even that), while their semantics is given by a combination of pretty prose, hidden assumptions, and wishful thinking.",2025-03-28 11:35:12,programming,programming,technology,Technology,[],0,65,15,,0.87,https://webassembly.org/news/2025-03-27-spectec/,sideEffffECt

1jmzkug,reddit,Git as a binary distribution system: dotbins for portable developer tools,"I'm sharing a different approach to managing developer tools across systems:

**Problem:** Every OS has different packages and versions. Moving between systems means constant tool reinstallation.

**Solution:** dotbins - Download binaries once, version control them, clone anywhere

The workflow:
1. Define your tools in a YAML file
2. Run `dotbins sync` to download binaries for all platforms
3. Store everything in a Git repo (with optional LFS)
4. Clone that repo on any new system

Create a `~/.dotbins.yaml` file with contents:

```yaml
platforms:
  linux:
    - amd64
    - arm64
  macos:
    - arm64

tools:
  # Standard tools
  bat: sharkdp/bat
  fzf: junegunn/fzf
  
  # With shell integration
  bat:
    repo: sharkdp/bat
    shell_code: |
      alias cat=""bat --plain --paging=never""
      alias less=""bat --paging=always""
  
  ripgrep:
    repo: BurntSushi/ripgrep
    binary_name: rg
```

After running `dotbins sync`, you'll have binaries for all platforms/architectures in your `~/.dotbins` directory.

```bash
# On your main machine
cd ~/.dotbins
git init && git lfs install  # LFS recommended for binaries
git lfs track ""*/bin/*""
git add . && git commit -m ""Initial commit""
git push to your repo

# On any new system
git clone https://github.com/username/.dotbins ~/.dotbins
source ~/.dotbins/shell/bash.sh  # Or zsh/fish/etc.
```

This approach has been a game-changer for me. I clone my dotfiles repo and my `.dotbins` repo, and I'm instantly productive on any system.

- My personal dotbins collection: https://github.com/basnijholt/.dotbins
- Project: https://github.com/basnijholt/dotbins

1jl8zxk,reddit,Let's Parse and Search through the JFK Files,"All -

Wanted to share a fun exercise I did with the newly released JFK files.

The idea: could I quickly fetch all 2000 PDFs, parse them, and build an indexed, searchable DB? Surprisingly, there aren't many plug-and-play solutions for this (and I think there's a product opportunity here: drag and drop files to get a searchable DB). Since I couldn’t find what I wanted, I threw together a quick Colab to do the job. I aimed for speed and simplicity, making a few shortcut decisions I wouldn’t recommend for production. The biggest one? Using Pinecone.

Pinecone is great, but I’m a relational DB guy (and PG\_VECTOR works great), and I think vector DB vendors oversold the RAG promise. I also don’t like their restrictive free tier; you hit rate limits quickly. That said, they make it dead simple to insert records and get something running.

Here’s what the Colab does:

\-> Scrapes the JFK assassination archive page for all PDF links.

\-> Fetches all 2000+ PDFs from those links.

\-> Parses them using Mistral OCR.

\-> Indexes them in Pinecone.

I’ve used Mistral OCR before in a previous project called Auntie PDF: [https://www.auntiepdf.com](https://www.auntiepdf.com/)

It’s a solid API for parsing PDFs. It gives you a JSON object you can use to reconstruct the parsed information into Markdown (with images if you want) and text.

Next, we take the text files, chunk them, and index them in Pinecone. For chunking, there are various strategies like context-aware chunking, but I kept it simple and just naively chopped the docs into 512-character chunks.

There are two main ways to search: lexical or semantic. Lexical is closer to keyword matching (e.g., ""Oswald"" or ""shooter""). Semantic tries to pull results based on meaning. For this exercise, I used lexical search because users will likely hunt for specific terms in the files. Hybrid search (mixing both) works best in production, but keyword matching made sense here.

Great, now we have a searchable DB up and running. Time to put some lipstick on this pig! I created a simple UI that hooks up to the Pinecone DB and lets users search through all the text chunks. You can now uncover hidden truths and overlooked details in this case that everyone else missed! 🕵‍♂️

1jlwc1m,reddit,AbyssIRC: A modern opensource IRC server written in C# - Long live IRC!,"# AbyssIRC: A modern opensource IRC server written in C# - Long live IRC!

Hey all, r/programming!

I wanted to share with you my hobby project that I've been developing in my spare time: **AbyssIRC**, a modern IRC server written in C#.

# 📢 IRC is not dead, long live IRC!

Despite Discord, Slack, and all the other modern communication platforms, IRC continues to be used by many communities. It's simple, lightweight, and it works. AbyssIRC aims to bring new life to this historic protocol with a modern and scalable implementation.

# 🧠 A project to learn

I started this project mainly as a learning experiment. It has allowed me to explore:

* Scalable and event-oriented architecture
* Reactive systems with observer pattern
* Modular and extensible design
* Efficient network connection handling
* Standard protocol implementation

# 👋 Goodbye legacy code

It's time to say goodbye to IRC servers from the 90s! AbyssIRC is built with modern technologies and contemporary development practices. It's not just another fork of a historical project, but a completely new implementation.

# 🚀 Features and design

* **Scalable**: Designed to be distributed and handle a large number of connections
* **Reactive**: Uses event-driven patterns for internal communication
* **Extensible**: Integrated [Jint](https://github.com/sebastienros/jint) scripting engine for JavaScript plugins and extensions
* **Configurable**: Advanced configuration management via YAML
* **Testable**: Architecture that facilitates unit and integration testing

# 🔌 Jint scripting engine

One of the features I'm most proud of is the integration of the Jint JavaScript engine, which allows you to:

* Create plugins and extensions without recompiling the server
* Add custom commands
* Implement custom moderation logic
* React to server events with custom scripts

# 🛠️ Future developments

I plan to make AbyssIRC fully Kubernetes-ready, allowing for a distributed and highly available implementation.

# 🤝 Looking for contributors!

I'm looking for developers interested in contributing to the project. Whether you're a C# expert, an IRC enthusiast, or just curious, any contribution is welcome! Here are some ways you can help:

* Implementation of advanced IRC features (services, bouncers)
* Creation of plugins with Jint
* Documentation improvements
* Testing and bug fixing
* Implementation of CI/CD and k8s deployment

# 🔗 Project link

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/tgiachi/abyssirc-server)

# ❓ What do you think?

I'd be happy to receive feedback, suggestions, or simply discuss with other IRC enthusiasts or C# developers. Are you interested in a project like this? Do you have similar experiences to share?

*PS: If you're still convinced that IRC is dead, come take a look... maybe you'll change your mind!* 😉

*PPS: I'm fully aware that the code still has a long way to go and there will certainly be imperfections. I'm open to constructive criticism - you know, the kind that comes with concrete suggestions! If you see something that could be improved, instead of a simple ""this sucks"", I'd prefer a ""have you considered using X instead of Y because..."".

1k1nmh4,reddit,Nanoseconds-overhead C++ tracer,"Hello everyone, 

I did a project that is a instrumentation-based tracer/profiler that allows you to get a timeline of your system execution with really good time resolution. While there are many tools around that do similar things, this one I'm proud of because it allows you to achieve very low overhead, even like 8 nanoseconds per event gathered (as an example, function body call would need two such events, one to mark entry and second to mark exit). This work was initially done as part of my job, but my company made its version open source so finally I can redistribute my own, company-agnostic, version of it. 

Why it's cool and how can it help you? If you have some multithreaded application that has very very tight work being done there (on few microseconds level) with various dependencies between those threads, analysing performance issues can be very hard because sampling profiler won't tell you everything due to averaging everything, and manual instrumentation based on standard functionality can be simply too slow to keep some phenomena happening during profiling, causing performance Heisenbugs, kinda.

Additional thing that make this stand out - it's just 3 files you need to include in your project to start running. It's very lightweight and easy (well, if you're advanced) to understand. I guess it raises its educational value, because you can easily get a grasp of what is going on, and learn something neat about assembly code even if you don't want to actually use it. I created an article that is mentioned in the readme in which I tried to explain why some things are done that way and not the other.

Of course it's not ideal, it is not portable (only supports modern x64 CPUs and modern Windows/Ubuntu OSes) and it is not written in very clean way as some of the stuff could really be cleaned up without breaking the performance, so while I believe it has tons of educational value, clean code is not part of this value :P You have been warned.

One day I'm planning to also make another article, something like code walkthrough for less advanced readers, but I need to find some time to do it...

jnv v0.6.0 introduces some important features that enhance the user experience.

## Configuration

With this release, jnv now supports customization of various features using a TOML format configuration file. This feature allows users to adjust jnv's behavior and appearance according to their preferences.

### Configuration File Location

The configuration file is loaded in the following order of priority:

1. Path specified on the command line (`-c` or `--config` option)
2. Default configuration file path

The default configuration file location for each platform is as follows:

- **Linux**: `~/.config/jnv/config.toml`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/jnv/config.toml`
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\{Username}\AppData\Roaming\jnv\config.toml`

If the configuration file does not exist, it will be automatically created on first run.

### Customizable Settings

The configuration file allows you to customize items such as:

- Toggle hint message display
- UI reactivity (debounce times and animation speed)
- Editor appearance and behavior
- JSON viewer styling
- Completion feature display and behavior
- Keybinds

For detailed configuration options, please refer to [default.toml](https://github.com/ynqa/jnv/blob/main/default.toml).

## Default Filter (--default-filter)

A new command-line option `--default-filter` has been added, allowing you to specify a default jq filter to apply to the input data. This filter is applied when the interface is first loaded.

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Apply a specific filter to input data by default
jnv data.json --default-filter '.items[0]'

# Apply a filter to data from standard input
cat data.json | jnv --default-filter '.users | map(.name)'
```

This feature improves productivity, especially when you have frequently used filter patterns or when you want to quickly access specific parts of large JSON data.

## ARM Support

jnv v0.6.0 now provides ARM architecture support with binaries available for Apple Silicon macOS, ARM64 Linux, and ARMv7 Linux platforms.",2025-04-01 14:53:29,programming,programming,technology,Technology,[],0,16,2,,0.76,https://github.com/ynqa/jnv,aqny

1k63ok7,reddit,How does OIDC work: ELI5?,"Similar to my last post, I was reading a lot about OIDC and created this explanation. It's a mix of the best resources I have found with some additions and a lot of rewriting. I have added a super short summary and a code example at the end. Maybe it helps one of you :-) This is the [repo][repo-ref].

# OIDC Explained

Let's say John is on LinkedIn and clicks _'Login with Google_'. He is now logged in without that LinkedIn knows his password or any other sensitive data. Great! But how did that work?

Via OpenID Connect (OIDC). This protocol builds on OAuth 2.0 and is the answer to above question.

I will provide a super short and simple summary, a more detailed one and even a code snippet. You should know what OAuth and JWTs are because OIDC builds on them. If you're not familiar with OAuth, see my other guide [here][ref_oauth_repo].

## Super Short Summary

- John clicks _'Login with Google_'
- Now the usual OAuth process takes place
  - John authorizes us to get data about his Google profile
    - E.g. his email, profile picture, name and user id
- **Important**: Now Google not only sends LinkedIn the access token as specified in OAuth, **but also a JWT.**
- LinkedIn uses the JWT for authentication in the usual way
  - E.g. John's browser saves the JWT in the cookies and sends it along every request he makes
  - LinkedIn receives the token, verifies it, and sees ""_ah, this is indeed John_""

## More Detailed Summary

Suppose LinkedIn wants users to log in with their Google account to authenticate and retrieve profile info (e.g., name, email).

1. LinkedIn sets up a Google API account and receives a client_id and a client_secret
   - So Google knows this client id is LinkedIn
2. John clicks '_Log in with Google_' on LinkedIn.
3. LinkedIn redirects to Google’s OIDC authorization endpoint:
   https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?client_id=...&redirect_uri=...&scope=openid%20profile%20email&response_type=code
   - As you see, LinkedIn passes client_id, redirect_id, scope and response_type as URL params
     - **Important:** scope must include openid
     - profile and email are optional but commonly used
   - redirect_uri is where Google sends the response.
4. John logs into Google
5. Google asks: '_LinkedIn wants to access your Google Account_', John clicks '_Allow_'
6. Google redirects to the specified redirect_uri with a one-time authorization code. For example:
   https://linkedin.com/oidc/callback?code=one_time_code_xyz
7. LinkedIn makes a server-to-server request to Google
   - It passes the one-time code, client_id, and client_secret in the request body
   - Google responds with an **access token and a JWT**
8. **Finished.** LinkedIn now uses the JWT for authentication and can use the access token to get more info about John's Google account

## Addendum

In step 8 LinkedIn also verifies the JWT's signature and claims. Usually in OIDC we use asymmetric encryption (Google does for example) to sign the JWT. The advantage of asymmetric encryption is that the JWT can be verified by anyone by using the public key, including LinkedIn.

Ideally, Google also returns a refresh token. The JWT will work as long as it's valid, for example hasn't expired. After that, the user will need to redo the above process.

The public keys are usually specified at the JSON Web Key Sets (JWKS) endpoint.

## Key Additions to OAuth 2.0

As we saw, OIDC extends OAuth 2.0. This guide is incomplete, so here are just a few of the additions that I consider key additions.

### ID Token

The ID token is the JWT. It contains user identity data (e.g., sub for user ID, name, email). It's signed by the IdP (Identity provider, in our case Google) and verified by the client (in our case LinkedIn). The JWT is used for authentication. Hence, while OAuth is for authorization, OIDC is authentication.

Don't confuse Access Token and ID Token:

- Access Token: Used to call Google APIs (e.g. to get more info about the user)
- ID Token: Used purely for authentication (so we know the user actually is John)

### Discovery Document

OIDC providers like Google publish a JSON configuration at a standard URL:

`https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`

This lists endpoints (e.g., authorization, token, UserInfo, JWKS) and supported features (e.g., scopes). LinkedIn can fetch this dynamically to set up OIDC without hardcoding URLs.

### UserInfo Endpoint

OIDC standardizes a UserInfo endpoint (e.g., https://openidconnect.googleapis.com/v1/userinfo). LinkedIn can use the access token to fetch additional user data (e.g., name, picture), ensuring consistency across providers.

### Nonce

To prevent replay attacks, LinkedIn includes a random nonce in the authorization request. Google embeds it in the ID token, and LinkedIn checks it matches during verification.

### Security Notes

- HTTPS: OIDC requires HTTPS for secure token transmission.

- State Parameter: Inherited from OAuth 2.0, it prevents CSRF attacks.

- JWT Verification: LinkedIn must validate JWT claims (e.g., iss, aud, exp, nonce) to ensure security.

## Code Example

Below is a standalone Node.js example using Express to handle OIDC login with Google, storing user data in a SQLite database.

Please note that this is just example code and some things are missing or can be improved.

I also on purpose did not use the library openid-client so less things happen ""behind the scenes"" and the entire process is more visible. In production you would want to use openid-client or a similar library.

Last note, I also don't enforce HTTPS here, which in production you really really should.

1k511df,reddit,Expose local dev server with SSH tunnel and Docker,"


In development, we often need to share a preview of our current local project, whether to show progress, collaborate on debugging, or demo something for clients or in meetings. This is especially common in remote work settings.

There are tools like ngrok and localtunnel, but the limitations of their free plans can be annoying in the long run. So, I created my own setup with an SSH tunnel running in a Docker container, and added Traefik for HTTPS to avoid asking non-technical clients to tweak browser settings to allow insecure HTTP requests.

I documented the entire process in the form of a practical tutorial guide that explains the setup and configuration in detail. My Docker configuration is public and available for reuse, the containers can be started with just a few commands. You can find the links in the article.

Breaking away from traditional sequence models, transformers employ **self-attention** mechanisms (more on this later) as their core building block, enabling them to capture long-range dependencies in data with remarkable efficiency. In essence, the transformer can be viewed as a general-purpose computational substrate—a programmable logical tissue that reconfigures based on training data and can be stacked as layers build large models exhibiting fascinating emergent behaviors.

1k3zmdw,reddit,Announcing Traeger: A portable Actor System for C++ and Python,"I have been working for several months on a personal project that I just published.

It is an Actor System for C++ with bindings for Python, Go, and C.

It is written in C++ 17 for portability, with minimal use of templates to facilitate interoperability with other languages.

It is still in an early stage, but I think it provides the basics of the Actor Model:

1. Value semantics based on Immer.
2. Serialization (json, yaml, and messagepack).
3. Scheduler, Threadpool, Promises, Actors with mailboxes and messages (sequential for writers, concurrent for readers).
4. Network transparency based on ZMQ.

It has been tested on Ubuntu >= 20.04, MacOS >= 15.3 (for both x86\_64 and arm64) and Windows 11.

Please take a look, experiment, and if you like it or find it interesting, give it a star.

1jnx6uh,reddit,To run Llama 3.1-8B-instruct model on a local CPU with 4 GB ram without quantization. By Loading and Running a LLaMA Model on CPU with Disk-based Layer Loading.,"I am trying to run 3.1 8B llama instruct model [https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct)  on a 4GB ram laptop. The idea I'm using is to load and run one layer at a time.  
I have a class.  
It initializes key components of the LLaMA architecture:  
LlamaTokenEmbed: Handles token embeddings.  
LlamaLayer: Represents a transformer block.  
LlamaFinalLayerNorm: Normalizes the output before final predictions.  
LlamaFinalLayerHead: Generates final token probabilities.

Running Inference (run method)  
It processes the tokens through the embedding layer.  
Then, it iterates over 32 transformer layers (LlamaLayer) by Loading the corresponding layer weights from disk. Runs the layer on the input tensor x.  
After all layers are processed, the final normalization and output head compute the final model output.  
Here's the code

I was tired of typing `git log origin/branch..HEAD` so this is just:

    gh unpushed

You can also set a default remote, check against `upstream`, etc. Just a small quality-of-life thing for GitHub CLI users.

I just published a blog post on integrating Apache Kafka with .NET to build event-driven services, and I’d love to share it with you.

The post starts with a brief introduction to Kafka and its fundamentals, then moves on to a code-based example showing how to implement Kafka integration in .NET.

Here’s what it covers:

* Setting up Kafka with Docker
* Producing events from [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core
* Consuming events using background workers
* Handling idempotency, offset commits, and Dead Letter Queues (DLQs)
* Managing Kafka topics using the AdminClient

If you're interested in event-driven architecture and building event-driven services, this blog post should help you get started.

1k5rfb5,reddit,Explained: How Does L1 Regularization Perform Feature Selection? | Towards Data Science,"I was reading about regularization and discovered a line 'L1 regularization performs feature selection' and 'Regularization is an embedded feature selection method'. I was not sure how regularization relates with feature selection and eventually read some books/blogs/forums on the topic.

One of the resources suggested that L1 regularization forces 'some' parameters to become zero, thus, nullifying the influence of those features on the output of the model. This 'automatic' removal of features by forcing their corresponding parameters to zero is categorized as an embedded feature selection method. A question persisted, 'how does L1 regularization determine which parameters to zero out?', in other words, 'how does L1 regularization know which features are redundant?'.

Most blogs/videos on the internet were focusing on 'how' this feature selection occurs, discussing how L1 regularization induces sparsity. I wanted to know more on the 'why' part of the question, which forced me to perform some deeper analysis. The explanation of the 'why' part is included in this blog.",2025-04-23 05:21:03,programming,programming,technology,Technology,[],0,4,0,,0.75,https://towardsdatascience.com/explained-how-does-l1-regularization-perform-feature-selection/,shubham0204_dev

1jy2kin,reddit,[DEVLOG] Razen Language – Now with VS Code Extension + Major Updates,"Hey folks,  
I’ve been building a small programming language called **Razen**, and I’m excited to share a big update. I’m 16, and this project started as a fun experiment — but it’s been growing steadily, and now it has its own **VS Code extension** to make working with it a lot more comfortable.

# What is Razen?

Razen is a lightweight, beginner-friendly language designed with flexibility and simplicity in mind. I wanted something that felt different from most traditional languages — more expressive, less rigid. It’s still in active development, but the idea is to make it both fun and functional.

# What’s New?

* **VS Code Extension** Now available with syntax highlighting and basic support. Makes writing Razen code way smoother.
* **New Features & Keywords** Added things like `razen:freestyle` for more open, dynamic logic. Also improved how variables work and cleaned up a lot of syntax.
* **Core Improvements** Performance is better, codebase is more organized, and things are just more stable overall.

# Try It Out

If you’re interested in language design, like playing with new ideas, or just want to see something built from scratch — give Razen a shot.

**GitHub:** [https://github.com/BasaiCorp/Razen-Lang](https://github.com/BasaiCorp/Razen-Lang)

Open to feedback, thoughts, or contributions. Still early days, but I’m proud of how far it’s come. Thanks for reading!",2025-04-13 07:54:53,programming,programming,technology,Technology,[],0,4,0,,0.64,https://github.com/BasaiCorp/Razen-Lang,GladJellyfish9752

1jx23t3,reddit,A tool for notifying developers of a repo about anything.,"In my current org we'd often get people missing messages or notices about changes to the repo, e.g. ""we changed x, you need to run this command if you have this issue"", etc.

So I built this tool and we've been using it successfully to solve those problems for a while, and I just got around to open-sourcing it.

Basically it handles creating and showing people messages whenever they install dependencies (or anytime you want), and tracks if they've seen a notice or not.
