movies,1jxvqxf,mmvdv1y,"Just watched all 3 last week.

Absolutely fantastic films and really appreciate the levels of creativity and storytelling.

Would almost say it's perfect - but the issues with Crispin Glovers redundancy (not that he's a major part of 2 or 3 anyway) and Jennifer's odd recasting and relegation to an alleyway for 2 films hold it all back from perfection.

Fantastic series of films. Really feel good vibes.

3 was always my favourite. 2 always confused me as a child because I couldn't figure out which film I was watching. Also was lucky enough to ride BTTF at universal studios which is still the best ride I've been on.",14,2025-04-13 09:40:56,No-Comfortable6432
movies,1jxvqxf,mmusnqw,"I'm gonna go against the grain here and say I completely agree, all three movies make the perfect trilogy. The first is great as it's own story, yet the other two only enhance it and take nothing away. They all have very similar scenes, tropes, and characters that tie them all together yet each tell very different stories and have lots of creative conflicts that keep you hooked. Marty Mcfly and Doc Brown are a fantastic duo, and have great chemistry. They play off of each other perfectly. I love how Mcfly is constantly the underdog who is in over his head, yet through luck or cleverness, manages to overcome the odds. Doc Brown is so expressive and endlessly entertaining to watch, providing both laughs and heartfelt moments. Biff is one if the most entertaining antagonists ever IMO. 

Most of all, they are a period piece that is somehow timeless and accessible to audiences of all kinds. It is up there with The Matrix as my favorite Scif Fi series of all time. I love them more than even Star Wars.",29,2025-04-13 06:00:12,choren64

Except... they're in 2015. They're only \*in\* 2015 because Doc has brought Marty there from 1985 to stop his son from joining Griff's gang and subsequently destroying his family.

movies,1jqrc4e,ml96zwy,"Maybe a more uncommon answer:

A director who made something great to start and then fell off: 

**Marc Webb** (though I don't know if I'm ready to say say he's ""bad"").

I don't think *Amazing Spider-Man 2* was his fault, and I'd rank the first *Amazing Spider-Man* as a good movie, but *(500) Days of Summer* was such an inventive revitalization of the romcom (among many other touches, I loved the split-screen ""expectations/reality"" scene, which I know Webb used in a music video first but still) ... that it's a little surprising he's been so mediocre/middle-of-the-road since.

*Gifted* was okay; *The Only Living Boy in New York* was pretty bad; and then, while I don't want to attract the insane people here, I think it's fair to say that, while *Snow White* is definitely getting review bombed, it's still not a good movie.",53,2025-04-03 19:44:02,dtfulsom

This story stretched out for a week or two. But it was a hit with the kids. Every once in a while I’d get a request for Steve. 


Years go by, and one of my kids asks about Steve the painter. And I finally mention that the story was based on this weird movie I saw when I was a kid. I still remembered the title. 


You can find the whole movie online. We watched it. The kids were all like ‘WTF is this movie?!’ But they all recognized the plot pretty quickly.

Information from the filmmakers:

Trailer:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-373fptEXI

Hi r/movies! I am Matthew Rankin, co-writer/director/actor of UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE the new Oscilloscope Laboratories movie that won the first ever Audience Award at Cannes Directors' Fortnight, and was shortlisted for an International Oscar nomination. You can watch it now on home digital VOD platforms!

We'll be back at 12 PM ET tomorrow (Tuesday 4/8) to answer any questions you may have. Feel free to ask away in the meantime.

With me are my co-writers/actors Pirouz Nemati and Ila Firouzabadi, and our producer Sylvain Corbeil!

Synopsis: In a mysterious and surreal interzone somewhere between Tehran and Winnipeg, the lives of multiple characters interweave with each other in surprising and mysterious ways. Gradeschoolers Negin and Nazgol find a sum of money frozen in the winter ice and try to claim it. Meanwhile, Massoud leads a group of increasingly-befuddled tourists through the monuments and historic sites of Winnipeg. Matthew quits his meaningless job in a Québecois government office and sets out upon an enigmatic journey to visit his mother. Space, time and personal identities crossfade, interweave and echo into a surreal comedy of misdirection.

movies,1jtuf9y,mlxx5nd,"Hey Matthew, thanks for doing the Q/A - as an aspiring filmmaker, I jumped at the opportunity to make an account to ask some questions:

1.  I read in an interview that you and Pirouz were connected by Sylvain about a decade ago when you first wrote the script for UL, but given they're credited writers on the film, I was wondering how long before you started ***filming*** were Ila and Pirouz given the script to revise, and how much of the script changed once they were attached? Was the film always about a Canadian Winnipeg influence by Iran, or was that something they brought to the table?
2. I've heard you know some Farsi, but how were you able to direct the Farsi scenes of the film without proper fluency in the language? (Practically speaking)
3. Will we see more of Ila and Pirouz in the press? Would love to see them take more of an active role in the marketing of the film given they're actually Iranian.
4. Do you think white actors should be able to play characters of color more freely? (This isn't facetious, I'm asking earnestly given you've done it once in a short film, and twice in Universal Language)

Thanks for your time. Looking forward to your answers.",10,2025-04-07 22:46:16,AgilityIngenuity

movies,1jtuf9y,mlxrjkz,"Hi Matthew, I would love for you to answer this question. I know there are 2 Iranian co-writers on this film, but what made you decide to write, direct, and star in a movie about a different culture? There's obviously a lack of Iranian representation in films and TV shows but the rare instances where our stories get to be told, there's an unfortunate tendency for it to be done by non-Iranians. I'm just curious, why not choose to produce the film and give an opportunity to another qualified Iranian director if the goal is to support the cause?

My question for Matthew is what is your relationship to Iranian-ness? From the movie I get the sense you are very ingrained in the culture (love!). Is there an aspect to the film that is autobiographical? Also are there really that many iranians in winnipeg? It makes me want to travel there. Anyways congrats:),5,2025-04-08 00:40:17,NoLawfulness3328

Any luck with getting wider distribution? I've recommended to several of my friends who live in places where it hasn't played and they're hoping it will become available on streaming so they can actually watch it.

Also, incredibly weird one, but has anyone ever told you that you look like if Pedro Pascal and Johnny Knoxville had a baby?",4,2025-04-08 00:47:16,herman_gill

Your films have a strong aesthetic, with the brutalist architecture, the geometric shapes and the retro feel. In Universal Language, you mix Iranian and Canadian cultures to create an alternate reality (I really liked the Tim Hortons Tea House) that is equally funny and melancholic. What was the process in creating the visuals for this movie ?

movies,1k55u1w,moi6xmd,"Congrats; its by far the best of them. Lupin often gets compared to Bond (for obvious reasons) but one thing in common is that the majority of the movies aren’t particularly great, we just remember them for certain great moments in between other, more indulgent/ridiculous/regrettable moments, and you still know what you’re getting even in a worst case scenario and it’s generally acceptable.

Mystery of Mamo has some great stuff but feels janky compared to Cagliostro, and Fuma Conspiracy has some great sequences and feels like a fresh new perspective on the series, so those are the only two I’d put near Cagliostro. Dead or Alive is like the Dalton Bond movies; grittier and more of-its-time but a lesser version of its contemporaries its trying to match. The 00s specials suffer similarly (perhaps their analogue is the Brosnan Bond movies) where they’re mostly style over substance.

It's set in the very distant future (12,090 A.D.) on a post-apocalyptic Earth, where everything is barren, monsters and mutants run rampant, but technology still exists in a sense.  
  
A young girl named Doris is marked to become the bride of Count Magnus Lee. Afterwards, Doris hires a vampire hunter, simply named D, to kill the count and spare her the fate of becoming his wife. But there are other characters who come out of the woodwork, both on the count's side and in Doris' village, who try to vie for power and control.  
  
The style of art and animation is something of a time capsule in itself, and you can't really find that kind of aesthetic anymore. It's dark, but not too grim, a little violent and gory, and has just enough eeriness to give it that extra sense of mystique.

Enjoyed the acting throughout, and as someone old enough to have been at a few of the early Short concerts I enjoyed his involvement beyond just the movie's title.

We went for Pedro Pascal - and even though he was awesome, he’s not even the best part of the movie.

By the time she was released from the deal other big budget offers dried up and she had to scramble to continue being in movies... any movies - hence the relative low quality and budgets of her films moving forwards.

She went into detail about this on the Scott Adkins interview on his Youtube channel. A shame, she was a talented AF Martial Artist and in her interviews and public appearances comes across as a fun and engaging personality.",17,2025-04-16 12:53:01,Darrenlovesmovies

She's probably my favourite actress and I've seen 30 of her movies but I'm not surprised at all that she didn't break out into the mainstream. Also, I don't think working with Albert Pyun would've helped her.

movies,1jvhqsq,mmc8dda,"Them sticking with the ""they travel around the universe and hunt the biggest badass around"" is just silly. The reason why the first movie works is because of the subversion of the action genre of the time and the whole vietnam allegory. Everything else they tried has only made the predator less interesting. Less is more.
 
The same thing goes for Alien btw, their insistence of going back to the whole ""the perfect organism"" thing. You can't be a perfect organism if you got a bunch of spikey things on your back, your biggest enemy would be a full coat rack in a tight hallway! 

But first of all, the perfect organism is water bears. Secondly, we don't need any motivation from the evil corporation why they're evil. They're evil! Them sending unsuspecting workers to get the damn alien is enough reason. But, with Disney also being an evil corporation, it is only a matter of time before we get a Weyland-Yutani office workplace sitcom series on Disney+

I finally saw how delusional the male protagonist was and that he never truly respected any of the girl's boundaries and just wanted so desperately to keep the manic pixie dream girl stereotype of her in his mind and fantasies, that he never truly got to know her for who she really is. Now that I was older I had met men who were just desperately seeking a relationship just for the fantasy of it all and not exactly deeply looking at who they want to be with and that only led them on the same path of victimization and idealization just like the protagonist of 500 days of Summer. But yes, the child in me was just looking for a happy ending between the main characters just like in all fairy tales and it was easier to see the fault only in one of them instead of in both of them because I needed a hero and a villain, but it turned out that life is not so black and white.",24,2025-04-18 11:53:35,Strong_Meal7889

Information from the filmmaker:

Hey reddit,

I'm Liam Le Guillou, writer /director of the feature documentary 'A Cursed Man' - I had this idea, what would happen if I willingly (and respectfully) asked authentic magic practitioners to put a Curse on me? I thought surely nothing bad would happen if I personally didn't believe in this? Well the results of this year-long dark social experiment were a surprise to me! I sought out Witches, Voodoo Priests and Priestesses, and even a Satanist on this global adventure into the world of the occult. So tell me what do you think, are you a believer?

I love that it's all practical effects.  I love the acting, and love the camera shots. I love the use of one point perspective.  The behind the scenes are pretty cool to see how the effects were achieved.

There are some deleted scenes, but honestly they were unnecessary exposition on how the possession worked or a few more tidbits about Tass.  I think it was a great call to cut them.


There is so much subtle for shadowing in the first two scenes, everything comes full circle in the end.  This was a 5/5 for me.

>The most talked-about draft of *Gladiator 2* was the bizarre version written by Nick Cave. The film would have followed Maximus through the afterlife and reincarnation. He would become an immortal Roman soldier, cursed to live forever serving the republic and its interests. This included killing Lucius, who Maximus then learns was his son, as well as being sent by the pagan gods to destroy Christianity by killing Jesus Christ and his disciples.

>**The movie would then have followed Maximus through the centuries as a warrior, depicting him fighting in the Crusades, World War II, and Vietnam.** The movie would have eventually ended in modern times with Maximus working at the Pentagon. Perhaps not surprisingly given the wild ideas of the script and its deviation from the original movie, Cave's *Gladiator 2* script was eventually rejected.

I watched the documentary on Jodorowsky's legendary unfilmed Dune.

This is an absolutely idiotic, senseless moral to end the series on, and it completely undermines the series's core idea.

I believe it only exists because of a belief on Trevorrow's part that the ST ought to have ended on the series's fundamental, elegant, and extremely resonant central metaphor being 'built on' or 'moved on' from (I mean this to suggest he was artistically misguided, not that he was conspiratorially trying to reverse the series's central idea).

Fans have obviously discussed and imagined 'Grey Jedi' for decades, but they have always been a terrible idea - at least when they are conceived of as superior, more enlightened versions of Jedi.

Information from the filmmakers:

---------------------------------------------------------------------

More information:

Nina, a young, tempestuous woman, finds herself stranded in the far North. She convinces five men on a bachelor hunting trip, to put her up for a few days. In this masculine microsociety, by turns hilarious and philosophical, Nina starts to feel a sense of belonging she never has before. But a mysterious stranger’s arrival changes the course of this improvised holiday forever. Both raw and dreamlike, Hunting Daze offers up a unique universe where humour, horror, the uncanny, and the sensual combine.

Our film played at SXSW, Fantasia, Sydney FF, KVFF, and more. It's out now in the US and Canada on Digital.

Trailer:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O66TVAcpeFM

Nahéma was also the star of 2019's **Antigone** from French-Canadian director Sophie Deraspe, which won five Canadian Screen Awards (and TIFF's Best Canadian Film Award) and was submited to the Oscars as Canada's Best International Feature Film choice.

Maria was twice-nominated for an Oscar for Best Live Action Short Film (**Fauve** in 2019 and **Brotherhood** in 2020, both from Canada).

This is Annick's feature directorial debut.

movies,1k56e6v,mog1b5j,"Hello all, thank you for joining us :)

For Annick - Do you have any background in hunting? Or just a general interest? Was wondering what made you pick a hunting cabin as the location of the film. I've always wanted to check out SXSW. What was the premiere experience like? Any cool moments/stories from when you went?


For Nahema - **Antigone** was so amazing. Looking forward to catching this film as well. What was it like being the only woman actor on set? Also, I wonder if your prep is any different between a feature film and a short film? Very much looking forward to **Splitsville** as well!


For Maria - I saw that you were nominated for back-to-back Oscars for Live Short Film. That's super impressive! And I bet insanely rare too. Did you find that those nominations opened more doors for you? And would you consider going back to do more short films or do you prefer features now?

movies,1joy4oi,mkvhvnb,"The subtitled Japanese translation of the English lines have nothing to do with Criterion, they're hard coded into the film for the original Japanese audience.

I'm guessing they made the decision to not subtitle the English lines in English is because it would clash with the hard coded Japanese subtitles since they both use white.

EDIT:

I can confirm that exact same Japanese subtitles are present on the previous Echo Bridge blu ray release.",37,2025-04-01 16:02:00,SmokingCryptid
movies,1joy4oi,mkvttyn,"You brought up a bunch of different issues. But first, I’ve emailed Criterion many times and have always received a response. If it’s not a holiday and it’s been a week with no response, try them again. 

I’ve worked on ADA projects as well as having close friends who work in subtitling, captioning for the hearing impaired, as well as audio description, so I feel this issue strongly for the community. That said, these are all boutique distributors who are only licensing the film properties from the rights owners, typically major studios. Boutiques like Criterion have said the rights owners don’t allow them to add other languages and control all subtitling and captioning that must be approved. I would bet that even in cases where it might be possible, it’s still a huge cost and distributors generally work within the spoken language of their territory as that’s their main market.

I hadn’t heard about the issue with Criterion’s new Godzilla release, but the Japanese company Toho who owns the rights to Godzilla and many Japanese classics is extremely strict and difficult to work with. Criterion’s website says the new discs include “New English subtitle translation”. The Blu-ray.com review explains it: “Optional English subtitles are provided for the main feature. When English is spoken, Japanese subtitles are printed on the film.” It’s certainly limiting to only have translations and not full SDH in English, but I suspect Toho controlled that option here as well. 

Streamers like the Criterion Channel and others do not control the content and once again need to pay a separate license to be allowed to present them on their service. It’s why we got a censored streaming version of The French Connection, via Disney. The content comes as-is and they are not allowed to change the captioning or subtitles. Even if they could, it wouldn’t make sense cost wise because the licensing period is very temporary and a film might only be available for as short as a month. 

With special features, they’re either licensed or created by the distributors like Criterion. I suspect the costs are too much for them to use SDH for all of them, but you could ask them too.",11,2025-04-01 17:03:35,BogoJohnson

movies,1joy4oi,mkwunvo,"I hope it's not rude of me to jump in and ask a question.

How do you, as a deaf person, feel about the additions to HI/SDH subtitles that aren't strictly dialog, or identify who said what?  Are they helpful? Annoying? Don't much matter? Examples:

* (dog howls in the distance)
* (triumphant music plays)
* JOHN: Get out! FRED: Sure! (slams door)
* etc

As a hearing person who is getting older I have subtitles on more and more for the wife and myself, just to avoid missing anything that was said, and I sometimes wish all the extra stuff wasn't there.

As far as recent movies that fit this. No Hard Feelings wasnt bad. I watched it on a plane and had a great time with it. Ricky Stanicky reminded me of this era too. The leads didnt have the best chemistry but its worth it for John Cena alone. Him as a washed up celebrity impersonator whose entire schtick is making masturbation-based parodies of popular rock songs is the kind of gold you could use as currency with me. Lets Start A Cult also reminded me of a ""we're 15 and just snuck out of the house to get stoned. Lets watch a movie"" vibe.

We’re talking eliminating programs and classes, driving out professors because they’re subject matter is “too far left,” and banning student groups and protests.

We shouldn't be defending those individual actions. But you can't hold a whole movement, especially a spontaneous popular movement, responsible for its worst actors. 

And most importantly, the cause is just. More than that, the cause is urgent and necessary. Anti-Semitism and Anti-Zionism are not the same thing. The former is evil. The latter, given the actions of the Israeli state, is sensible.

The movie was okay. Even though Kelly Marie Tran was in Star wars and Bowen Yang is up and coming, I don't think they bring too much audience.

I think Crazy Rich Asians started to pave the way for a lot of Asian projects to be made, (Interior Chinatown for example), even the success of Everything Everywhere all at once was pretty piviotal.

movies,1k1tsqm,mo09sur,"I didn’t love the movie, thought it would more comedic than dramatic. Loved Min’s character and the way the actor delivered the punchlines, and Kelly Tran’s dramatic acting. What I didn’t love was the pacing, so much happening all at once; I really disliked Bowen yangs character/acting, he didn’t do a great job delivering the dramatic beats. Overall it was a weak movie sadly, I think it would have been better as a show and more of a clear idea of what the tone should be",4,2025-04-19 23:25:54,juna42kela
movies,1k1tsqm,mob8t66,"I was really looking forward to this. And I did not like it at all. I read that Lily Gladstone said she felt protective of Kelly Marie Tran. And that may be why they felt more like sisters here? Gladstone has had amazing chemistry with other female and male leads (check out Under the Bridge, although don’t it’s not good. But her chemistry with Riley Keough was out of this world. Plus I thought she was great with Leo.) But nothing here. 
 
And Bowen’s plight of millennial malaise felt out of step when everyone else had real problems. Like Min is dealing with potentially being disowned and made poor and he’s actually fine with both. Lee is broke and wants a baby. Angela has serious mommy issues. And Chris… can’t commit and watches birds. And that’s the storyline that gets all the attention. 

I am not one who thinks cheating is the end of a relationship every time. I feel, like here, that it’s often the symptom of relationship troubles. And I am not opposed to exploring that in movies or even showing how sexuality is a spectrum. 

But it was resolved way too quickly with Lee and Angela. (With Min and Chris, Min didn’t seem too bothered since their relationship was in a weird place but Lee was very upset and it wasn’t resolved well.) And I hate the queer lady gets pregnant and it’s a good thing trope. They didn’t actually explore anything. 

And the dragon dance interruption made no sense. It was Angela and Lee that joked about the dragon following them around. And Chris and Min weren’t even at the first event. And it’s not part of Min’s culture to have any separate cultural significance. The callback wasn’t actually a callback that made sense for the couple. 

I love Joan Chen in everything and she was a scene stealer here. One of the few chuckles I had was her taking over the photo shoot. I actually thought it was really interesting to have a mom who makes her daughter’s sexuality all about her. First in a negative way and then in a toxically positive way. I haven’t seen that explored much. But it does happen. But even that didn’t get explored much. 

Also loved the grandmother. Especially her immediately figuring out what is going on. 

I thought it would be funnier. I thought it would be more about queer joy.  It was just kind of a slog. It didn’t know what it wanted to be. It had elements of farce but wasn’t a farce. It had elements of deep character exploration but, ultimately, that was shallow.

The metaphor for intergenerational trauma even falls apart.

I really liked how it didn't hit its themes over your head like other horror movies do, like you said it was just a classic campy dumb fun movie with some interesting layers. It never took itself too seriously, and for that reason, I'd easily watch it again. I know it was based on Stephen King, but I will say the creative liberties they took \*felt\* very Stephen King to me, in that it's ridiculous and life is meaningless, but you can still form connections anyway.

- he's shaving with a regular razor, Linda comes out and he quickly switches to pretending he's shaving with his huge That's A Knife. 

- asks his mate the time, then goes up to Linda, glances at the sun and tells her the exact time. ""Old bushman's trick!""

movies,1jtxz8d,mlxy3hv,"The thing about Babylon is that the whole thesis it's giving us is that the dream factory that is Hollywood exists side-by-side with the problematic people and general abuse caused by the industry. They can't be separated, they feed into each other. So for Babylon to successfully do what it wants to do it purposely pushes up against the viewer. There are multiple piss and shit scenes in the first half an hour as well as incredible performances by Pitt and Robbie and some really incredibly well crafted scenes. 

There is a lot to have fun with and a lot to be abhorred by. Mix that with a target demographic that is older (appreciates the golden age of film) and it's really no wonder it bombed. But the movie in itself is a representation of what this movie loves about the industry, that despite all of the greed and abuse of the industry someone is still willing to give you 100 million dollars to make an audience feel great and terrible.

Seeing that movie for the first time, only a couple weeks after Robin Williams died, turned out to be a full therapy session of my own. When Matt Damon cried into Robin Williams’ shoulder, I just felt all of the sadness from the past two weeks release and I just started breaking down crying.

movies,1jr0qs7,mlb4f4e,"This is such a classic heartbreak film. Really, I struggle to think of movies that are as introspective and all encompassing about breakup feelings. The format of HIgh Fidelity allows for so much reflection and self awareness around these topics. Seemingly heavily inspired by Annie Hall, Cusack really impresses in this as the first hour of it is almost a one man show where he monologues about his complex feelings. 


Seeing Cusack go through his middle-school-to-recent relationships in order is just a banger idea to get through all these feelings, but this movie really opens up in the second half when he starts calling all his old flames and asking what happened. It’s so real, how we put these former relationships on a pedestal and always forgetting why they didn’t work out, then you spend five minutes with the person and you immediately remember. I was especially taken by the high school relationship, when they get lunch and she has to remind him that he left her because she wouldn’t get physical. And not just that reminder, but the very real moment where she reveals that she slept with the first person who she was too tired to fight off after crying over Cusack for weeks. There’s some really poignant stuff there about perspective, about how our selfish actions affect other people while we walk away and don’t think about it for ten years. Really amazing scene. 

And if this movie wasn’t good enough, what it does at the end is so subversive for the time. After getting back together with the girl that started this whole plot, Iben Hjejle,he meets a seemingly more perfect woman. She’s a music journalist, she loves his obscure work, and she shows an interest in him. And most movies might take this chance to give him a happy ending and show the existential crisis depicted in this as unnecessary when he ultimately decides to leave Iben. But the movie doesn’t do that. The ultimate lesson of this movie is that there will always be seemingly greener grasses, that moving to person to person is just a series of realizing people aren’t the fantasies you build up in your mind. 

The ending to this movie is so good because Iben isn’t the perfect person he’s been looking for, but she’s the one who’s still there. Who survived a rocky relationship with him and is still by his side. And maybe the most adult thing you can do is stop chasing and start focusing on what you have. It’s actually incredibly powerful, and bonus points for Jack Black getting his plot wrapped up in such a fantastic way by seeing him completely own that stage and those vocals. This is a movie about how a familiar job with your friends can seem like adult purgatory, and watching all those record snobs find happiness in their way is so satisfying. 9/10.

The whole picture was clearly zoomed in to fit the Imax aspect ratio and as a result was missing a decent portion of the original artwork. It was a pretty big bummer for me. A big part of the beauty of this movie and reason for wanting to see it in Imax is feeling immersed in these large vistas and scenes.

It’s like—blank slate protagonist, reaching around the ship for clues, POV shots. All very game-esque. By the time we get to the reveal of the monster, with its split head and tentacle arm, I was thinking, wait, was this the fight with Dr Burlington in Resident Evil 2, or is it more like Nemesis in RE3, hmmm.

I guess I'll pretend the last shot doesn't happen.

Two extra thoughts, I genuinely thought the movie was going to end with her just dying on the operating table from the surgery machine for a moment. That would have been such an anti-climax but I almost would have been impressed.

The movie itself was decent. The story was pretty by the numbers. I thought the killers reveal was kinda underwhelming and their motive was super lame.

There’s no theme about fame, or desensitization of violence due to the media, or anything related to their motive. It just didn’t feel thought out to me. The script didn’t seem to have a theme in mind.

That being said, I had fun with this movie. The characters were fun to watch and I got a few chuckles. Honestly it seems like they just wanted to make a fun horror movie, and that’s what they did.

I went primarily because this is the first time I know of that a Gen Z-oriented movie was actually directed/written by Gen Z, and I just wanted to see a Gen Z movie that understood who it was depicting. It was a very sincere, funny movie. All of the actors were more or less playing their actual ages, and all of the dialogue and interactions felt realistic to how people actually talk. The humor landed so well. A few sequences made me laugh out loud. I also really liked Finn/Billy/Fred's characters respective arcs.

I don't have many other slashers to compare it to, but the whole movie felt like it was trying to be more grounded vs trying for outlandish kills/events. I especially appreciated the choreography in the final fight scene. I'm guessing it won't do well in theaters because most people watching will want something more straight-forward slasher and it's really much more of a coming-of-age comedy set during a slasher scenario.

This film to me, speaks on a great deal more than what many are giving it credit for. I’ve seen it being misidentified and minimized as trauma porn, where the audience is being needlessly exposed to a man’s suffering without point behind it. I could not disagree more with this. Let me go ahead and get the most polarizing opinion I have about this film out of the way : It both more effectively displays and illustrates the male loneliness epidemic, and the effects/consequences of it when combined with traditional masculine ideals pushed to extremes, than Taxi Driver does. Yes, I fully recognize the influence that taxi driver has on this movie and many others, and without it as a blueprint this film would effectively cease to be. With that being said, I feel like the characterization seen here is a step above, and there is no better time for a film like this to release from a cultural and social standpoint. 

Despite the character of Killian Maddox suffering from an array of potentially innate mental disorders that worsen his positioning and interactions with the world around him, the ultimately exacerbating factors are ones that are all too common. The isolationism that Killian faces due to his more niche area of interest, lack of support or extended family, and limited time and resources to expand his circle outside of his workplace and gym, is incredibly damaging. 

His lofty idealistic goals, that require achieving impossible heights of grandeur and esteem in order to feel fulfilled, are so often parroted in old school traditional homes not dissimilar from the one his grandfather raised him in. The idea that in order to be worthy as a man in this world, you can’t simply exist, but must be GREAT. That sort of drive to escape mediocrity as a means of self actualization is what both keeps Killian alive but is also what destroys him from the inside. It’s another separating factor from him and the rest of society, those who are content with normalcy and prioritize personal relationships, things that he hasn’t been raised to understand. Many of the effects that we see on screen as a result of these factors, are ones that affect men that YOU, the person reading this, currently know, some to a lesser degree depicted, but others comparable in damage. 

As frightening as it is, many men can see parts of themselves in Killian. Now more than ever in a social media age, where young men are being exposed to all manner of content that allows them to disassociate from real world interactions, and dampens their social skills and ability to connect with those around them. Now more than ever where podcasts that perpetuate gender wars are commonly spread, and push misogyny over acceptance, superficiality over genuineness, and monetary gain over meaningful relationships. Killian Maddox is, just as Travis Bickle was, a warning to young men. A cautionary tale begging to be heard, where we see the absolute deconstruction of a man who like all of us so desperately wants to be accomplished, to be seen, to be loved, but with every attempt to do so pushes himself further from all of what he could want because his methodology stems from his detachment to reality. 

Whenever he’s not obsessively chasing towards his goal, he drowns himself in pornography and YouTube. Distraction methods that are easier for him to do than to connect with other people in any meaningful way. Easier to do than to be honest with his therapist, and confront the traumas, stresses, and pain that lead to his feelings of discontent and anguish. He robs himself of a proper outlet for his feelings, all to maintain the image that he is strong and unaffected, as he believes a man should be. As a result all of these bottled feelings explode into violence, poor decisions, strong impulsive feelings, even going as far as to consider murder and suicide. At times this movie felt as if it was a biopic for a future mass shooter, and more effectively breaks down the events that would lead to it better than any movie in that genre that I can think of. 

This film SHOULD be uncomfortable. It places a magnifying glass on the ugliest aspects of social pressure, home taught values, and trauma that are shaping many of our young men today. Shaping them to be confused, to be angry, to be lost. This is one of the most under appreciated and under discussed film in the last decade, and I think it’s a real travesty that it is not being seen on the scale that it should be, by the generation that truly needs to see it most. This movie is a wake up call.",9,2025-04-12 07:44:58,Prometheist7

movies,1jkty5x,mjyjrh8,"About the school house. I've been 3 times to see it. Must have been 1991 the first time. 2006 the latest. If anyone is curious it's Potter Schoolhouse 17110 Bodega Ln. Bodega CA. Nowhere near the town of Bodega Bay much less up the street from The Tides like it's made to look like in the movie.

Even in 1991 none of us were able to figure out the logistics of the school yard where the crows are on the jungle gym between the school and Annie's house. There were/are full grown, slow growing, full grown redwoods right next to the school house. Right where Melanie would have been sitting on the bench. You can see them still on Google Maps. And I mean more than 30 years old large trees back in 1991. Looks like it's fenced now too which it wasn't in 2006. Use to be able to walk up onto the porch of the school to take pictures. And Annie's house was either just a built facade on an open lot there. That's what the Brenner house was. Just a fake house on open land torn down after the movie was shot. Or Annie's was a real house that was torn down and a new one rebuilt because the one there now looks nothing like her's.

I'm just going to guess that they were able to use just camera trickery and compositing to make it look like they were next to each other. Because it's those trees. Redwoods and pines. Those could not have grown to that size in less than 30 years between when it was filmed and I first saw the place. And they're about the same size now.

More information from the filmmaker:

-----------------------------------------------

Hey reddit,

I'm Mike Ott, director and co-writer of McVeigh. It stars Alfie Allen as Timothy McVeigh, and Ashley Benson, Tracy Letts, Brett Gelman, Anthony Carrigan, and Isolda Dychauk. It premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2024.

It's out in theaters and digital now.

Synopsis:

After the deadly siege in Waco, Texas, U.S. Army veteran Timothy McVeigh hatches a sinister plan to blow up the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City.

Here's our trailer:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MYKHos_kTA

movies,1jjjm2f,mjo5fgp,"Hello Mike. You replied to a comment I made about the trailer. Thanks for flagging the AMA to me!

To expand upon what I was saying in relation to the trailer, to what extent were you and your team thinking about the current political climate as you were making this film? What steps, if any, did you take to keep this movie from lionizing and mythologizing Timothy McVeigh? I'm sure you have done something, but tell us how you have given yourself peace of mind that this is not going to become a rallying symbol for like-minded individuals that inspires copycat acts of violence?

**Edit:** So now that the AMA is done, I'll confess I'm a little disappointed not to have gotten an answer. I feel like he sort of answered versions of what I was asking elsewhere in the thread, but he did reach out to me asking me to join this conversation based on something I said a month ago after seeing the trailer. If he didn't want to address these concerns head-on, I wonder why he bothered to do an AMA about what he must have known was going to be a contentious movie.

Based on this experience and the versions of his answer I have read in this thread, I believe I'll give this movie a pass. Here's hoping he's right and no one will use his work as an inspiration for violence. I sure would have liked a categorical, ""We make it clear this is not someone to be celebrated or mimicked"" statement, but maybe he didn't say it because he didn't do it.
