2. Russian 'Cards' Kaput - Poor lil mistreated Putin won't be getting money from Russian oil revenue -- Uh oh - he'll lose his cards!
3. Arab Relations Kaput - Trump just made the rich Arabs he has been courting poorer.  That'll give them fewer reasons to accept any US trade route deal, and more reason to align with BRICS, 'Rusher', and 'Chiner'.
4. US Big Oil Donors Kaput - DRILLBABYDRILL Big Oil contributed over half a billion to Trump's campaign to get his allegiance on exploiting all the 'liquid gold under our feet'.  Guess what fellas it's just CHEAP dirty OIL again, get in line.

So much for demonizing clean energy.  So much for pushing for AI & Crypto data centers powered by corrupt Big Oil, fracking, etc.  Big OPEC players are back in the game, thanks to Trump's factory-killing tariffs.  Cheap crude is back.

mnfhq1k,1k0o62v,reddit,"ARTICLE:

The European Union on Wednesday published a list of seven countries that it considers “safe,” as member states seek to speed up migrant returns.

The list includes Kosovo, Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, India, Morocco and Tunisia.

WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR ASYLUM CLAIMS?

The expanded list means EU member states will process applications from the countries deemed safe using an accelerated procedure because they have a low chance of success.

“Many member states are facing a significant backlog of asylum applications, so anything we can do now to support faster asylum decisions is essential,” said Magnus Brunner, the EU’s commissioner for migration.

Although the EU presented a similar list in 2015, the plan was abandoned due to heated debates over whether or not to include Turkey.

WHY IS THE CHANGE BEING MADE NOW?

Brussels is under mounting pressure to crack down on irregular arrivals and ramp up deportations, as hard-right parties ride a wave of anti-migrant sentiment across Europe.

Hawks including Sweden, Italy, Denmark and the Netherlands in October demanded fast-tracked legislation to boost returns — and urged the Commission to act swiftly.

Italian Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi said the change “constitutes a success for the Italian government, which has always worked both at a bilateral and multilateral level to obtain the revision of the regulation.”",2025-04-16 16:08:22,40,OutrageousCost4818,news

Depending on how that goes they can formally charge you at which point the prosecution needs to show a judge they at least have some real evidence, the judge can either disagree and you're done or the judge can set or deny bail.

Wow, didn't even offer to buy the company, just voted to steal it. That's a very public step backwards in commercial ownership rights.

""Two Service Members Lives Wasted on Needless Political Spectacle""

  
Accidents happen. Accidents happen all too often when you place young men & women in situations where they are tasked with operating heavy equipment and machinery while overburdened, fatigued, in austere conditions. A military life is not always a safe life. They weren't drafted, they volunteered, but that's no reason to exploit their commitment to service by placing them in an environment that makes accidents like this more likely. 

Make no mistake, the entire Border mission is a political show to appease the current administration. The US Army is not trained to conduct these operations, nor is it part of their roles as defined in current military doctrine. Border security is the responsibility of Customs and Border Patrol - something this government continues to fail to remember. If CBP is unable to perform their duties, it should NOT fall upon the Armed Forces to pick up their slack. A Stryker (like the one depicted in the photo attached to this article) is overkill and wasteful for the role assigned, which would be under normal circumstances be performed by a CBP officer in a CBP Ford Expedition or similar SUV. Which perfectly encapsulates the overwrought optics of this whole sideshow.

Two Americans died, needlessly, in a situation they should never have been in. Contact your Representatives.

They proceeded to run full speed into an ironwood tree, completely wrecking their nice, new truck. I pulled past them, and, kind of in disbelief, asked the driver if they were okay. A man in military fatigues, who looked like he had been up for days on Bang! Energy or experimental military-grade amphetamines, said to me, “that’ll buff right out”. 

I wonder if this accident was something like that. ",2025-04-16 14:26:03,37,Readecv,news

Trendy US restaurants began selling panini, with distinctive variations appearing in various cities.

>During the 1980s, the term paninaro arose in Italy to denote a member of a youth culture represented by patrons of sandwich bars, such as Milan's Al Panino, and Italy's first US-style fast food restaurants. Paninari were depicted as right-leaning, fashion-fixated individuals, delighting in showcasing early-1980s consumer goods as status symbols.

This is just a number to me. An IQ score does not indicate that you are kind, empathetic, compassionate, or any other of a number of qualities which I find are more important.
