mnj2kyy,1k13g9j,reddit,"Immunologist here!


The threat is low. Like, next to 0 low.


Our immune systems are BEAST compared to 10,000 years ago. That's because we have 10,000 years of ancestors who survived these things and handed down that knowledge thru genes.


Most people on this earth today have a natural resistance to the Black Plauge. that doesnt mean we cant catch it, but it means in most cases, we could survive it better than people did 600 years ago. This is because most of us alive today had ancestors that survived the black plauge due to their genetics, the ones who didn't survive didn't pass down their genes


This is why when we visit uncontacted tribes, half of them die of random diseases that we carry on our bodies, but we have built immunities to over generations.


Humans today are the product of the strongest genes surviving these types of pandemic events throughout our history. Natural Selection at work.


Plus. Old bacteria will be snuffed out by the most common antibiotics. Old viruses COULD pose an issue, but the odds are high that our bodies are far too alien for them to survive and propagate in. Just like people can't get diseases whales get, the chance is extremely low of something unthawing and instantly infecting humans well enough to spread



No. Prions are what keep me up at night. Fucked up Lil protein strands that can turn your brain to mush, make your organs leak out of your asshole, turn your lungs into jelly slowly, allowing you to drown in your own tissue.


No cures for prions, no way to reverse them once they start. They can spread, they can lay dormant inside you.

We have to cook them at 1000 C, 1800 F, just to destroy them. They survive radiation, acid, pure alcohol. Your body would die 10x over, and all that'd be left is prions.",2025-04-17 03:56:03,114,unfinishedtoast3,todayilearned

>*Magnificent Ambassador etc. This letter is more to keep up with good practice than for any pressing need, since we have nothing to write to you about, nor news from anywhere. Our last was of the 10th and the last we have from you were of the 5th, and since wehaven’t had any more fromyou, weimagine you hadnothing to write, much like us. But one ought not to omit the good custom of writing frequently, even when there is nothing happening that matters, writing at least once every 3 or 4 days, so that at least this office assists the private persons who send letters in this way*

..

That same letter was wrongly associated with Machiavelli, Michelozzi's predecesor, because it bears Machiavelli's signature, but its impossible to be signed by Machiavelli, so the paper's author here suggests that the scribe who actually drafted the letter maybe have done it on purpose as a small act of defiance, because he was sick of Michelozzi, the new boss, was forcing him to write letters for no god damn reason at all, which would be hilarious if true

>*The difference between a scribe’s «i» and an «a», appearing in a single letter, is so small that it might hardly seem worth the trouble of examining. It could have resulted from a psychological, if not a mechanical slip. Possibly it was a small act of rebellion against Michelozzi, the scribe’s new boss, who was imposing a rigor in record-keeping evident in the very text of the letter to Vettori, with its emphasis on «good practice». Michelozzi himself had written the draft, preserved in the «minutario», from which this scribe copied out the Borromeo letter.*",2025-04-08 16:01:33,55,Ainsley-Sorsby,todayilearned

mnqv669,1k238sq,reddit,"The parasite Ribeiroia ondatrae is a flat worm parasite that infected tadpoles. stages are released from snails that find and infect tadpoles. once the find a tadpole they encyst and in it's limb bud, and release a chemical (retinoic acid) that fucks up normal development resulting in extra legs, no legs or messed up legs.  This makes the frogs slow and they are more easily eaten by predators (like birds). once eaten the parasites live in the gut of the bird and will release eggs. eggs will then get into the water and infect snails and start ti asexually reproduce in the snail releasing the satge that infects frogs.  The thought is that the snails purposefully cause these deformities so the frogs are eaten more easily which helps the parasite complete its lifecycle.

The bronze medalist didn't come in fourth, was too far from first to realistically have won, and no one is going to put them on a cereal box so they can go off and happily live the rest of their life as an accountant.

It's important to know we don't know if it was actually 30.000 who were disappeared. A declassified estimate from the military claims 22.000 either killed or disappeared between 1975 and 1978 - the so-called ""annihiliation decrees"" allowing the military to crack down on ""subversive elements"" within society had been signed in democracy. The lack of accurate records of those illegally detained and their fates was very intentional: at the trial of the leaders of the Junta, the defense's main argument was that those who were disappeared were in a kind of limbo where it was impossible to prove whether they'd been killed or not.

*He took up diplomatic posts in both Berlin and London before returning to Tokyo where he was posted to the North America desk of the Japanese Foreign Office. He was on duty on the weekend of the Pearl Harbor attack in December 1941.[3] Acting as secretary to Foreign Minister Shigenori Togo, Kase had assisted in the preparation of the document formally terminating negotiations with the United States. In an interview after retirement, he blamed Japanese diplomats in Washington for delays in decoding and delivering the cabled text of the statement, which he claimed should have been delivered an hour prior to the beginning of the attack.*

*On September 2, 1945, Kase was present as part of the Japanese delegation on board USS Missouri for the signing of the treaty of surrender in 1945.[4] At his suggestion Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu and other civilian members of the party wore formal diplomatic attire of morning dress and top hats ""because we were representing our sovereign"" (an exception to this was Saburo Ota, who wore no hat and whose white suit contrasted with other civilian members' mostly black morning dress).

The kid saw a snake, didn't know what it was and picked it up - a baby copperhead.

In Egypt's sandy silence, all alone,  
Stands a gigantic Leg, which far off throws  
The only shadow that the Desert knows:—  
""I am great OZYMANDIAS,"" saith the stone,  
""The King of Kings; this mighty City shows  
The wonders of my hand.""— The City's gone,—  
Naught but the Leg remaining to disclose  
The site of this forgotten Babylon.  

We wonder — and some Hunter may express  
Wonder like ours, when thro' the wilderness  
Where London stood, holding the Wolf in chace,  
He meets some fragment huge, and stops to guess  
What powerful but unrecorded race  
Once dwelt in that annihilated place.  

— Horace Smith, ""Ozymandias""


---



I met a traveller from an antique land  
Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone  
Stand in the desart. Near them, on the sand,  
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,  
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,  
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read  
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,  
The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed:  
And on the pedestal these words appear:  
""My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings:  
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!""  
No thing beside remains. Round the decay  
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare  
The lone and level sands stretch far away.

mklm7ot,1jngvge,reddit,"
“Ozymandius” was inspired by a sculptured bust of the Pharaoh Rameses II. His grandfather, and founder of the Rameses dynasty, had an afterlife that really fit the theme of the Shelly poem.

What happened was this.

There used to be a tourist trap in Niagara Falls called the Daredevil Hall of Fame. This had various displays. Among them was a “scary mummy” that would frighten the kiddies, along with a wide selection of other oddities and freaks of nature.

Well, after over a century, the museum went bankrupt and its collection was sold off. The persons disposing of the collection noted something odd about the mummy … it had certain features of its mummification that looked specific to actual royal mummies.

After investigation, it turned out that the tacky tourist exhibit was none other than Rameses I - literally the grandfather of “Ozymandius”! 

Look upon my works and despair indeed. 

How did an actual royal mummy end up scaring kiddies for two bits a gander in Niagara Falls for over a century? 

Basically, that came down to the 19th century antiquities trade. A local family discovered a “mummy cache” near the Valley of the Kings, created as a hiding spot for New Kingdom royal mummies as the New Kingdom started to fall apart and the tombs began to be systematically looted - and used it as their own personal warehouse of antiquities to sell to wealthy foreigners. The authorities caught them eventually, but not before they had sold, among other things, the mummy of Ramses I (albeit no one knew who he was).",2025-03-30 23:22:07,53,Malthus1,todayilearned

mmyewqn,1jyfkln,reddit,"Well at least parallax wasn't a factor in his determination.

A friend, [Chris Penny](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Penny_(rower)), rowed for Oxford in the 1980s.  He was American and an Olympian from the 1984 boat which unexpectedly lost to Canada, fetching silver.  Both teams relied upon a substantial stable of ""colonials"" to beef up their boats.

The big race was coming up, and the Oxford team ran erg tests to fill their first boat.  This was all well and good, but the president (a Brit, as the president had only ever been a Brit) of the rowing club didn't make the cut.  Excuses were made and a second round of trials conducted.  This also failed to seat the puny president.  I am not sure if further trials were conducted, but the gambit was clear- the powers that be were intent on having the president in the first boat, no matter his merit.

My friend wasn't having it.  He declared a mutiny.   Chris and the other Americans refused to race if the best boat wouldn't be presented.  It was tabloid fodder and a real scandal.

Oxford put the president in the boat and backfilled the seats of the mutinous athletes with the various anemic British members of lesser ability.  

Then... horror.  Oxford beat Cambridge despite being powered by its wheezing, all-British 8.

You'd think this would make for a bad story.  But that would be the case only if you didn't know Chris Penny.  He was and always has been a textbook American of the best sort: a blond 6'5"" man with a lantern jaw, kind disposition.  He dealt with the disfavor among the coaching staff that accompanies a failed gambit of this kind.  The ""colonial"" rowers, and possibly a few Brits, flocked to him.

Despite there being a B movie grade ""dramatisation"" of the affair on British TV, in which Chris had been portrayed as a conniving opportunist, he was voted president the following year - the first ever non-British man to attain this station.

[Article link](https://animals.howstuffworks.com/mammals/hippo-sunscreen.htm)

>Though Barr's heroic adventure in the bulky hippo suit proved fruitless, some other scientists have had better luck. Instead of weighing themselves down in armor, a team of Japanese researchers led by Professor Yoko Saikawa collected sweat samples by wiping a hippopotamus's face and back with absorbent gauze and then extracting the chemical components with water.

>**What they found were two unstable and highly acidic compounds -- one red, which they named hipposudoric acid, and one orange, which they named norhipposudoric acid. Although the two chemical pigments are unstable on their own, when they dry on the animal's skin in the presence of mucus, they harden and stick around for hours. Thus, the thick, sticky mixture is tough enough to survive the hippos' daylong soaks, all the while absorbing sunlight in both the ultraviolet and visible range [source: Saikawa].**

>When Saikawa and his team tested the pigments, they found that hipposudoric acid is also a powerful antibiotic. At concentrations even lower than those normally found on the animal's skin, the pigment's high acidity -- hundreds of times more powerful than vinegar -- inhibits the growth of pathogenic bacteria [source: Saikawa, Arthur].

>­The antiseptic powers of hippo sweat help to explain how the beasts manage to remain largely infection-free despite the wounds the males often inflict upon one another with their tusks -- long ivory teeth that can grow up to 20 inches (51 centimeters) long. These canine teeth are so imposing that when males want to threaten one another, sometimes all they have to do is stand face to face while opening their mouths an impressive 150 degrees in a process called gaping [source: San Diego Zoo]. If the sight of one another's jaws doesn't scare the other off, they'll duke it out by slashing at each other with their teeth or swinging their giant heads back and forth like wrecking balls.

>Despite extensive (and valiant) attempts to research it, much remains a mystery about the hippo's gooey antibiotic sunscreen. Saikawa's team hypothesizes that the animal synthesizes it from amino acids (the building blocks of protein) in the presence of oxygen. Since all hippos seem to produce the pigments, scientists don't believe their ""sunscreen"" is linked to diet. Some scientists think it may even act as a bug repellent since flies seem averse to landing on it [source: Grossi].",2025-04-21 13:20:30,6,Jason_Worthing,todayilearned

* The aftermath of Antietam saw General George McClellan relieved of his command of the Army of the Potomac, as Lincoln had grown tired of his overly cautious approach to the war. This sparked a series of misadventer commands as Lincoln and the Union looked for a capable commander to lead the Army before finally appointing George Meade to the position (eventually Grant was made overall commander of the Union's armies, and his tenure in that position completely overshadows Meade's capable command of the Army of the Potomac).

Their return was absolutely huge; I vaguely remember walking there from Virginia because it was impossible to get downtown by car.

It was so hot and crowded, probably the biggest crowd I've ever seen--about .002% of the US population was there.  But everyone was cool... until the Beach Boys couldn't get it together so they called in Hank Williams Jr early.  

As soon as they did everything predictably went South.  By then people had been drinking all day and I think it's safe to guess that hundreds of fights must have broken out because all the yahoos rushed the stage and were stealing beers out of peoples' coolers as they went.  I'd never seen a fistfight before and within minutes I saw half a dozen at once.  Soon the rednecks had ruined everything and within half an hour I'll guess that a hundred thousand people left.  

Maybe half of everyone was left at the end of his show, and everyone who left was knowingly giving up on the biggest fireworks display in the world.

I've often wondered what Williams felt about that day because he would have seen more people walk out on him than ever went to one of his stadium shows.  Maybe he thought it was funny, watching all the families get driven away.",2025-04-07 07:56:38,18,PaintedClownPenis,todayilearned

I took the proto-warheads to school and they were a huge hit, kids daring others to eat that weird Asian candy that was sooo sour, until the vice principal confiscated it all as contraband. Had kids asking me months after ""got any more of that sour candy?""

mki98eu,1jn4k84,reddit,"TLDR: During his years in Venice, Vivaldi wrote music to be performed by an orchestra from an orphanage, with financial support from the Republic of Venice. The audience was the general public of the day in Venice. 

For years, Vivaldi wrote music with economic support from the Republic of Venice (but later, also support from wealthy patrons) to be performed by - and give jobs to - girls who were orphans or had been abandoned by their parents.

From Wikipedia:
«In September 1703, Vivaldi became maestro di violino (master of violin) at an orphanage called the Pio Ospedale della Pietà (Devout Hospital of Mercy) in Venice; although his talents as a violinist probably secured him the job, he soon became a successful teacher of music there.

Over the next thirty years he composed most of his major works while working at the Ospedale.

There were four similar institutions in Venice; their purpose was to give shelter and education to children who were abandoned or orphaned, or whose families could not support them. They were financed by funds provided by the Republic.

The boys learned a trade and had to leave when they reached the age of fifteen. The girls received a musical education, and the most talented among them stayed and became members of the Ospedale’s renowned orchestra and choir.»

«In early 18th-century Venice, opera was the most popular musical entertainment. It proved most profitable for Vivaldi.»

It was very common for decades if not centuries before.

EDIT: Ok, it's pretty much verbatim copied from the wikipedia page, which makes the claim it was revolutionary without any sources whatsoever.

(Four-teen fiv-teen etc)
So after 20 everything makes sense.

Twenty two

One hundred fifty five

Three thousand eight hundred sixty seven

In dutch we go from left to right, but then at the end we go the other way again.

So 22 we basically pronounce two and twenty. (Tweentwintig)

155 we say hundred five and fifty (honderd vijf en vijtig) 

3867 would sound akin to three thousand eight hundred seven and sixty (drie duizend acht honderd zevenenzestig)

Sometimes. Most of the time it was ESL since the majority were ESL kids so I got no real of help with my math troubles. Middle school I just was put in the slower math classes with again no true help with anything. Not until high school did I get a teacher who was like hey it seems like this is your issue let's try and work with that rather than work around it since that's not working (shout out to Mr. Christian you were the best!). It sucked so much I felt like i got kind of forgotten about simply because no one knew exactly what was ""wrong"" with my math comprehension. 

still to this day (I'm mid 30s so well away from school) I count on my fingers and when having to do anything with numbers I get them mixed up, or some get left out and I have to write things down to make sure everything is in order. Sometimes if it's a lot of numbers or a long equation my brain just gets overwhelmed and blanks out. i'll stare at whatever i'm working on and just see the numbers but can't begin to put them together or work out the equation. I've worked as a cashier more than once and luckily the math was done for me but if the system went down you bet i'd be counting on my fingers or have a pencil and paper making sure my change was correct. i'd get some funny looks but i'm so used to it by now it doesn't bother me like it used to. luckily I can ask my boyfriend to do any math related stuff since he's great with math so it's taken some stress off me.

Sorry for the essay I never really talk about this even though it was kind of a huge thing in my life throughout school and i feet there's a lot to explain to get the whole picture. Hope this gives some insight into a life living with dyscalculia! any questions feel free to ask i'd be happy to talk about it. 

  
tl;dr I have dyscalculia, i get numbers mixed up or even left out when trying to do any kind of number comprehension or problem solving. school was horrible at helping me with it i'm sure cuz they didn't even know what I had.

If I had to make a guess, and this is a total guess, the US had a nasty habit of carrying along a store of mustard gas into battle theaters, just in case.  I think it was within a year that a US ship in port in Italy was bombed, leading to the largest poison gas release of the war.

There had just been an absolute shit-show of a battle on Attu Island in the Aleutians.  Maybe they hauled some mustard gas along.  Then, going back toward port in San Diego, they might decide, hey, let's dump this shit overboard, somewhere off shore of L.A.  Then the pressure of the deep water ruptures the gas shells, it bubbles back to the surface, and blows into the city, heavily diluted but still irritating.

The US flat-out lied and hid evidence regarding their chemical weapons almost-use during World War II, so what you'd want to look for instead is evidence of a cover-up.

This was a very nice rehab that my insurance for some reason actually paid 100%. When I say nice I mean cafeteria style food with things like real BBQ wings, hot wings, great macaroni and cheese and other sides, fantastic breakfast options. We even had steak every other week. Everything was cooked fresh daily. Unlimited amount of juices, soda, bottled water. Then our group activies were things like kickball, softball, an obstacle course, disc golf. We had a TV in the community room that we could watch until 1am. They had a full medical area with doctors and nurses. We got our meds on schedule like clockwork. Fantastic psychiatrists and psychologist. Plus just being around a group of guys who were going through the same things with alcohol or drug use. It really helped talking with people who had been there. They would also let us smoke and dip on an outside patio. Then they would do a weekly trip to go get any nicotine products for the patients who needed them. We of course had to pay for that out of pocket but a lot of rehabs won't even let you smoke. They just hand out nicotine patches. Everyone always looked out for the new patients because we remembered how much those first few days/week sucked. Most emphatic group of people I've been around. I'm rambling at this point but if it didn't take becoming addicted to alcohol again I would go back for another month in a heartbeat. I was so relaxed and refreshed after not having to deal with the ""real world"" for awhile and be able to escape to just focus on my mental health. ",2025-03-31 05:33:43,20,Equivalent_Seat6470,todayilearned

mke6otw,1jmpdsb,reddit,"There's an interesting, if probably apocryphal anecdote about Velázquez and Pareja.


First of all, you must understand that Velázquez was quite obsessed with getting a nobility title. This wasn't just snobbery: at the time, in Spain, the aristocracy didn't have to pay taxes. Now, there were two obstacles to this: the first one was his background: there's good evidence that he was a descendant from converted Jews, and such ""new Christians"" were barred from the nobility (and indeed public administration). However, he could get around that obstacle by finding a pliant genealogist. The other obstacle was more fundamental, though: aristocrats weren't supposed to do manual work, only war and the liberal arts. Painting wasn't suitable. So Velázquez went on a decades-long lobbying campaign to get the powers-that-be to distinguish the artist from the artisan. Indeed, the whole concept of ""fine arts"" arguably goes back to him.


Now the tale goes that he was already close to success when the king paid a visit to his workshop. Pareja, who he had apprenticed and taught until he became quite a good painter himself, took the occasion to plant some of his own paintings among those of Velázquez. And they were good enough to catch the eye of the king. When asked about one them, Velázquez honourably admitted that they weren't his own work, but his slave's.


To this, the king, amused, asked how it could be that the same person who kept telling him that fine paintings were the work of superior minds deserving to join the ranks of the aristocracy could hold as slave somebody with such a talent himself. Velázquez, humbled, proceeded to free Pareja (and ultimately achieved his aim when the king made him a knight of the Order of Santiago).


Now, the story is very probably apocryphal, if only because Velázquez freed Pareja when he was living in Rome, not Spain. However, what we know for sure is that the relationship between Velázquez and Pareja was always a friendly one, with mutual trust and respect. And this is certainly reflected in this supremely dignified portrait: Velázquez always reflected his subjects' character, or at least his own opinion of them, in his portraits. And he could be as [merciless with the powerful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrait_of_Innocent_X#/media/File:Retrato_del_Papa_Inocencio_X._Roma,_by_Diego_Vel%C3%A1zquez.jpg) as he was [compassionate with the powerless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrait_of_Sebasti%C3%A1n_de_Morra#/media/File:Diego_Vel%C3%A1zquez_%E2%80%93_El_buf%C3%B3n_el_Primo_(Museo_del_Prado,_1644).jpg).",2025-03-29 18:24:54,65,Rc72,todayilearned

The point he's making is that he has very high-standards for what it means to be 'life-affirming' as opposed to 'life-denying'. The test for whether you can really be said to affirm your life - not the idea of life or life in general, but your specific life - is if, when a demon told you that for all eternity you would repeat your current life forever, over and over again, going through the same sufferings and traumas and trials (as well as the happy moments), you would be overjoyed and embrace the demon as a bringer of happy news.

Anything less is life-denial, since if you were to wish for things to be otherwise you would be denying your specific fate in favour of something else. He thinks this is what effectively all currently existing ideologies do - Christians reject this life in favour of eternal life with Christ, Buddhists reject this life in favour of nirvana, socialists reject this life in favour of life after The Revolution, and so on.",2025-03-28 14:21:15,85,waitingundergravity,todayilearned

mnx03t9,1k2v2mo,reddit,"Medieval cathedral exteriors, including Salisbury Cathedral, were once vibrantly painted in reds, blues, ochres, and gold. Facades, statues, and reliefs were adorned with mineral-based pigments and gilding, creating striking visual spectacles. Over time, weathering and industrial pollution erased most traces of this polychromy. However, remnants survive at sites like Amiens and Chartres, where studies and light projections reveal their former brilliance. Though Salisbury’s exterior paint has faded, historical evidence suggests it, too, was once richly decorated.

One time he was serving as chief mate and they were hauling petrol out from the Persian gulf, during the Iran-Iraq war. Both sides had made a habit out of destroying one another's petroleum infrastructure and trade, which included oil tankers. Needless to say, his vessel ended up being the target of a sole exocet missile, presumed to be launched from one of Saddam's Super Étendards.




They got hit. Panic ensued. He told me how in that moment you see who's who. Crew trying to launch life boats with a single person in. Taking a dive off the deck. Kneeling down on the deck and praying. 




Till this day I don't know if prayers work, or if only some of them do some of the time, but whatever the case might've been in that moment, those specific prayers must've worked. The missile ended up piercing the ship's hull below the vapor line and into the liquid, and the warhead malfunctioned and did not detonate. After about an hour a US NAVY vessel approached and they embarked on the ship for repairs. The personnel that they lowered into the tanks to retrieve the missile and patch up the hole from the inside was described as what we would refer to as an absolute unit nowadays.

mk72kt5,1jlw66l,reddit,"People in this thread don't know who Raymond Chandler is? He was one of the inventors of the ""hardboiled"" style of detective fiction. Stories about tough underworld thugs and tough private eyes, about dames with mysterious pasts and police officers that are on the take.

Basically Agatha Christie helped invent the polite mystery, where sneering evil blackmailer gets painlessly murdered by poison at a rich family's country estate and then a wise detective questions all the suspects, inspects the evidence, and in the last chapter reveals to the reader who committed the crime. The criminal then receives a just punishment (either goes to jail or commits suicide.)

Raymond Chandler mysteries feature pain and violence and moral ambiguity. The victim isn't some terrible person that the world is better off without. They didn't get painlessly poisoned and passed away sleeping, instead they were shot in the back and bled out in a filthy alley. At the end the killer often gets away with their crimes. (""Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown."") 

A standard Christie detective is a refined Belgian gentleman with a perfect moustache who is investigating because he enjoys the mental exercise, while a standard Chandler detective is a private eye who took the case because he needs the fee to pay off his bookie, and he's an alcoholic because when he's drunk is the only time he can forget the faces of the Germans he bayoneted in the trenches.

mnc8t3j,1jyrmlj,reddit,"476 CE is the date commonly given for the ""fall of the Roman Empire"", but more accurately that's just the year when the *western-half* of the empire whimpered out of existence. The Empire, which had been divided for almost a century for administrative reasons, continued to exist and thrive (to an extent) in the East for another 1000 years. Based in Constantinople, modern day Istanbul, the Roman Emperor continued to rule over provinces, legions, and citizens promoting the Roman way of life, culture, and political tradition. 

One of the biggest issues that the Romans themselves never really got around to figuring out was what constituted a legitimate emperor and how one might become an emperor legitimately. Sometimes a son would follow their father as Emperor, and sometimes a chosen or adopted one would follow, but the vast majority of Emperors gained the job through murder, civil war, and/or bribery. Whoever was closest to the throne when it became empty, with the most money and the most soldiers, often became the next Emperor. Because of this Emperors often had an elite unit of soldiers close around them, guarding themselves and the capitol, which went by several names but were most-famous as the Praetorian. 

The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th centuries were rough for the Empire for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to a large number of periods of internal civil unrest, civil war, and political infighting/violence. In order to secure the Imperial Throne men would often bribe the Praetorian Guard to help them, or stay out of their way, but like when you create a monetary incentive for anything *someone* will get the bright idea that they should engineer situations whereby they could profit some more. Part of the big contributing factors to Rome's long, slow decline (especially in the West) arose from the Praetorian Prefects' becoming more and more involved facilitating and effecting the removal of an existing Emperor (and the choice of the new one, of course). The Officers and Soldiers charged with protecting the Emperor became the ones most likely to try and assassinate them and sell their office to the highest bidder. 

The Praetorian Guard, the elite body guards of the Emperors, would be officially disbanded under Constantine I in the early 4th century. In the 10th century Basil I would initiate the most recent elite body guard unit called the Varangian Guard. The Varangians were mercenaries of Slavic, Scandinavian, and Anglo-Saxon origin who traveled the waterways of North and Central Europe as traders, raiders, and opportunists of every stripe. In the centuries between the 4th and 10th centuries there had been other elite units, but the memory of the Praetorians meant most Emperors maintained a normal legion in the Capitol for that purpose or they employed a privately funded force in an attempt to keep their body guards from becoming their murderers.

mm0jxe3,1juau4m,reddit,"Until 1870 Germany was a collection of small principalities, considered separate from the also German-speaking Austrian empire to the south. Prussia, the leading northern German power, wanted to united Germans outside Austria into one nation. A war with France, the leading European power, was a way to do so. Germany defeated France in 1870 in six weeks (although resulting events continued for another year). Wilhelm I of Prussia became the first Emperor of Germany—crowned in the former French royal palace of Versailles—and Bismarck became first chancellor of united Germany.

In 1889, an Edison employee demonstrated the American inventor's new phonograph around Europe. He recorded the voices of many famous people; Bismarck, born in 1815, is among the oldest people whose voices have been preserved. From the article:

>Bismarck quoted the first verse lyrics of ""La Marseillaise"", amongst others, when being recorded on an Edison phonograph in 1889, [the only known recording of his voice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czko31-6O8I).

If plugged into a properly wired amplifier (the ""phono"" jack), the inverse RIAA Curve would be applied, adding back what was removed for vinyl printing.

>Decommissioned satellites must re-enter the atmosphere to avoid becoming space debris.

That's kind of missing the point.   [There is concern that aluminum nano-particles from satellites may deplete ozone.](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024GL109280)  The particles stay in the high atmosphere for many years, and of course the satellite has a working lifespan of a few years between launch and reentry.   The concern is that we have already put a damaging amount of aluminum *above* the atmosphere, even though there isn't really noticeable damage to the atmosphere.

How Some Children Played at Slaughtering

I

In a city named Franecker, located in West Friesland, some young boys and girls between the ages of five and six happened to be playing with one another. They chose one boy to play a butcher, another boy to play was to be a cook, and a third boy was to be a pig. Then they chose one girl to be a cook and another girl her assistant. The assistant was to catch the blood of the pig in a little bowl so they could make sausages. As agreed, the butcher now fell upon the little boy playing the pig, threw him to the ground, and slit his throat open with a knife, while the assistant cook caught the blood in her little bowl.

A councilman was walking nearby and saw this wretched act. He immediately took the butcher with him and led him into the house of the mayor, who instantly summoned the entire council. They deliberated about this incident and did not know what they should do to the boy, for they realized it had all been part of a children's game. One of the councilmen, an old wise man, advised the chief judge to take a beautiful red apple in one hand and a Rhenish gulden in the other. Then he was to call the boy and stretch out his hands to him. If the boy took the apple, he was to be set free. If he took the gulden, he was to be killed. The judge took the wise man's advice, and the boy grabbed the apple with a laugh. Thus he was set free without any punishment.


II

There once was a father who slaughtered a pig, and his children saw that. In the afternoon, when they began playing, one child said to the other, ""you be the little pig, and I'll be the butcher."" He then took a shiny knife and slit his little brother's throat.

Their mother was upstairs in a room bathing another child, and when she heard the cries of her son, she immediately ran downstairs. Upon seeing what had happened, she took the knife out of her son's throat and was so enraged that she stabbed the heart of the other boy, who had been playing the butcher. Then she quickly ran back to the room to tend to her child in the bathtub, but while she was gone, he had drowned in the tub. Now the woman became so frightened and desperate that she did not allow the neighbors to comfort her and finally hung herself. When her husband came back from the fields and saw everything, he became so despondent that he died soon after.",2025-04-24 14:46:30,29,deafhuman,todayilearned

ml5s0gn,1jq5mkh,reddit,"Just to make it clear, this generally requires specific environmental conditions in order for it to work. 

This tends to require a state of brumation (which could probably be its own TIL, ""brumation vs hibernation."" But for this topic, we could think of it as functionally being similar: brumation works because metabolic processes temporarily slow down, thereby requiring less energy and less oxygen. 

This works during the winter, when turtles are in a state of brumation and are still in the water which is covered by a layer of ice (the ice preventing them from sticking their noses out to breathe). 

Restrict a turtle's ability to breathe during the summer, and they'll likely just drown. Summer conditions mean that their metabolism is in full swing, which requires more oxygen. In this situation, the oxygen that they can extract from their cloacal lining is almost certainly not enough for their required metabolic processes. So now if you dunk them under water and don't allow them to breathe, they  simply die. 

Anyway, some turtles can breathe out of their cloacas (especially during conditions in which the water would naturally be covered in ice). And some apparently drowned turtles can actually still be alive and recoverable even outside of brumation; if you ever see a turtle that you think has drowned, it's probably worth giving a good 24 to 48 hours just to make sure. Turtles can often survive being ""drowned"" longer than we can, and sometimes they might look dead but be capable of a full recovery.

But yes...this usually only works during winter, when environmental conditions have already triggered the turtle's metabolism to slow down a lot. Any other time, they basically have to breathe just as you or I. And if they don't, they just drown.",2025-04-03 06:36:42,1,soFATZfilm9000,todayilearned

mk5ybcd,1jlhufn,reddit,"People mix racial or ethnic based antisemitism with religious tensions between abrahamic faiths. 

Like when people say: ""Christians don't know Jesus was Jewish?""

Duh, everyone who is religiously educated knows that. Christianity has nothing against the Jewish patriarchs, that's why the old testament is part of the Bible. 

Not only that, most of the fathers of the church were Jewish. And Paul made it clear in Romans that both Jews and Greeks (gentiles) were to be treated equally. He himself was a Hellenized Jew. 

The religious tension comes from the fact that modern Jews come from communities that didn't convert to Christianity. So they're not ""evil"" for being Jewish. They're ""wrong"" because they didn't accept Jesus as the promised Messiah. 

So, in reality, both Christianity and Rabbinical Judaism see themselves as the rightful inheritors of Second Temple Judaism, which was the one prevailing during Jesus' time. Christianity was a Messianic offshoot that became universal by accepting gentiles, and Rabbinical was kept as an ethnocentric religion based on the teachings of the pharisees.

mo0170x,1k384sp,reddit,"Pedro Pizarro, Spanish chronicler and witness of the battle: 

> ...and when they reached the other (tower), they had a big-eared man as a captain, so brave that it could be said of him what was said of some Romans: this big-eared man carried a shield on his arm, a sword in his hand, a club in the hand of the shield, and a helmet on his head. These weapons he had taken from the Spaniards who had died on the roads, and many others that the Indians had in their possession. This big-eared man was walking like a lion from one side of the tower to the other at the very top, hindering the Spaniards who wanted to climb with ladders and killing the Indians who surrendered to him... So when his men warned him that a Spaniard was coming up from somewhere, he would goad him like a lion with his sword in his hand and his shield in his hand... and Hernando Pizarro ordered the Spaniards who were coming up not to kill this Indian but to take him alive... When this big-eared man saw that they had won the tower and had taken the fort from two or three sides, throwing down his weapons, he covered his head and face with his blanket and threw himself down... Hernando Pizarro was very sorry not to take him alive.

Chronicle of Pedro Pizarro

in spanish:   
  
...y llegados al otro (torreón) tenía un orejón por capitán tan valeroso que cierto se podría escribir de él lo que de algunos romanos, este orejón traía una adarga en el brazo, y una espada en la mano, y una porra en la mano de la adarga, y un morrión en la cabeza. Estas armas había habido este de los españoles que habían muerto en los caminos, y otras muchas que los indios tenían en su poder. Andaba pues este orejón como un león de una parte a otra del cubo (torreón) en lo alto de todo, estorbando a los españoles que querían subir con escalas y matando a los indios que se les rendían... Pues avisandole los suyos que subía algun español por alguna parte, aguijaba (estoqueaba) a él como un león con la espada en la mano y embrazada la adarga... y mandó Hernando Pizarro a los españoles que subían que no matasen a este indio sino que lo tomasen a vida... Visto este orejón que se lo habían ganado (el torreón) y le habían tomado por dos o tres partes el fuerte, arrojando las armas se tapó la cabeza y el rostro con la manta y se arrojó... A Hernando Pizarro le pesó mucho no tomarlo con vida.

mjvegij,1jki3ry,reddit,">The earliest stone vessels in Egypt date as far back as the [Late Neolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Neolithic) (c. 5100 – c. 4700 BC).[^(\[1\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_vessels_in_ancient_Egypt#cite_note-:0-1) From the [Predynastic Period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predynastic_Period) (c. 4000 – c. 3100 BC) onward, hundreds of thousands were created in a wide variety of shapes and materials, many from hard stones but the majority from soft [calcareous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcareous) rocks, especially [travertine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travertine).[^(\[2\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_vessels_in_ancient_Egypt#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBevan20072-2)

>Two unrobbed galleries under Djoser's pyramid were packed with at least 30,000 or 90 t (200,000 lb) vessels of mostly travertine, but also of hard stones, for example 892 of gneiss.[^(\[1\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_vessels_in_ancient_Egypt#cite_note-:0-1) Many of the vessels are of types popular during Naqada II or the earlier Dynasties and some are inscribed with the names of Djoser's predecessors, meaning they were heirlooms, private donations, or even plundered or drawn from old stores. Unfinished examples are also among the collection. This suggests that the stone vessel industry was diverted to the construction of the pyramid complex.[^(\[38\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_vessels_in_ancient_Egypt#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBevan200768–72-38)

>4th Dynasty tombs show that the average quantity, quality and diversity of vessels was in decline. Early dynastic examples were reused. At the same time, hard stone statues and sarcophagi were increasingly made. Gneiss, basalt and granite were extensively used as building materials and for sculptures, but rarely for vessels. Again, this implies a redirection of skilled labor from stone vessel production.

_In its 2004 election manifesto, the victorious Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party (PSOE) included plans to adopt absolute primogeniture, a proposal which was supported by the leader of the main opposition party, the conservative People’s Party. It was initially thought that the change would only apply to future generations but with all the major political parties in agreement that the system of male-preference primogeniture conflicts with the constitutionally established principle of gender equality, it was planned that the law would be changed before Letizia, then the Princess of Asturias, bore a son, thereby demoting Infanta Leonor in the line succession.

I came up with a similar idea in my last novel, Parallel Highways, where a character was singing an original song with her band. I was trying to figure out how to pull it off to give it more of a flow when read and that's when it occurred to me to base it off of a song that has an inspiring sound and just work from there. I picked Florence and the Machine's ""Queen of Peace"" and just started making my own lyrics from the melody. I took the time to sound out the syllabic count, and pacing over several days, and I think it came out pretty good. 

It's definitely my method for creating songs in a story going forward.",2025-04-18 23:15:34,3,Chernobog3,todayilearned

mn5azdl,1jzczkt,reddit,"Commissioned on 17 July 1906 as the armored cruiser *USS Tennessee*, she was renamed in May 1916 when Battleship hull No. 43 was slated to be given the name Tennessee. In July she took to sea for a patrol off Santa Domingo, which US Marines had landed at in May that year and installed a provisional military government.  

On the 29th of August, she was anchored just over a half mile off shore in 45ft (14m) of water alongside the gunboat *USS Castine*. They sat far east of the Ozama River to get what shelter from the wind the point of land nearby offered. The area was already recognized as dangerous due to rough seas, a westerly current, no protection from the south, and the anchorage being on a narrow ledge, around 60ft (18m) deep, with the seafloor dropping off to 600ft (183m) abruptly within several yards/meters. Due to this risky location, 2 of her 16 boilers were kept operating and it was expected she could be underway in 45 minutes. About a week prior she had been made ready to get underway due to heavy seas within the expected amount of time, although the anchor was stuck briefly and by the time it was able to be raised the captain decided to ride it out.  

On this day, seas were rough but not abnormally so. The usual shore leave was given and everything went as usual with the 1530 (3:30pm) launch leaving as scheduled. Fifteen minutes later, Captain Edward L. Beach gave the order to prepare her to get underway. A launch was sent to bring men ashore back and the engine room worked with the expectation they'd have the steam to put out by 1635. The reason for the captains decision was an increase in swell and the site of a yellow wave, estimated at 75ft (23m) in height, that stretched the entire horizon.  

At 1600, as reported by future rear admiral Thomas Withers, Jr., then a lieutenant aboard the *Memphis* stated the barometer read normal at 30.00 and he had no trouble reading it showing there was little motion in the ship. Within a short period of time the situation changed. The distant wave was now estimated at 100ft (30m) and was yellow-orange in color. There was no wind but a large swell was sighted and as it neared shore it grew in steepness. The ship rolled over it and in the following waves she began to roll up to 45° causing water to pour in through the casemate gun ports and even via ventilators that sat 50ft (15m) above the waterline.  

The launch sent to retrieve the men ashore was returning at this time. Lt Withers recalled, ""it was about 500 yards from the ship when the first swell passed the ship. At 4.05 p.m. this boat was thrown end over end by the *second* swell. The boat sank and all but about six of the men in her were drowned or smashed to death on the beach."" Some reported that several men from the launch were thrown alive into Fort Ozama, which sat on a cliff 40ft (12m) above the ocean.  

The waves continued at 30-40 second intervals with a few sailors washed overboard. These waves would grow so steep they would wash over the bridge by several feet and water would enter the stacks 70ft (21m) above the waterline and dampen the fires. They appeared to be irresistible, but other than tearing loose objects on deck, they had little smashing power and did little real damage. The *USS Castine* managed to get underway at this time and, after nearly being washed into the coastline, was able to move out to sea. Watching from 45ft (14m) above the water in the bridge, the men of the *Memphis* would lose site of the *Castine* in the waves with even her mastheads disappearing below the crests. Although damaged and nearly capsizing at times, the *Castine* and her crew would survive the approaching walls of water.  

About a quarter after the hour the ship began hitting bottom when it went into the trough between waves. A few minutes later the situation became worse as the anchor began dragging. After slamming into the seafloor, each wave would pick her up and carry her several hundred feet toward the beach with the anchor and 420ft (128m) of chain being of no effect. More water began flowing down the ships stacks putting out the fires and ending the chances of the ship getting underway. She was at the mercy of the sea and her crew would be mere passengers.  

Around 1630 the ship was ""thrown on the bottom so hard that most of the crew were knocked down, mess tables torn from their brackets, the ready shells for the broadside guns burst from their racks, piping, etc., crashed down, and below decks became a death trap."" She then landed on the port side of her hull and the crew braced for her to capsize. Luckily, the ship righted and came to sit even on her keel but waves continued to smash into her. With a draught of 29ft (8.8m) she was in shallow water and ""the motion became most violent.""  

The dynamos (electrical generators) stopped but the engineers stuck to their posts. A pinnacle of coral smashed through the hull and crushed two of the boilers into the deck above. The propellers were destroyed and the engines lost pressure as boilers ruptured and pipes broke releasing scalding steam that horribly burned men. Showing extreme bravery the men remained at their posts until ordered to leave. Lieutenant Claud Ashton Jones still refused to leave his post because he believed he could hear the engines still turning. In reality, what he heard was the destruction of the engines as they were slammed and battered by the seafloor and the waves.",2025-04-14 23:27:07,26,Chief-17,todayilearned

moxl78v,1k77pgj,reddit,"""A couple of weeks into the shoot, I arrived on set to great excitement. Word was going around that someone called “Sting” would be joining the Dune cast. Please bear in mind that I am primarily a fan of classical music and not the most pop-culture-fluent guy around. This Sting chap arrived the following day. I was at once struck by his gorgeous looks and his modest manner. A day or two later, we were appearing in the same scene. As is inevitable on a film set, we found ourselves waiting to work, sitting side by side while David Lynch and his crew set up a shot. I thought I would indulge the man in some conversation. “So,” I said, “I understand that you are a musician?” “Yeah, that’s right,” he said. “What instrument do you play?”
I detected a slight smile. “Bass,” he said. “You know,” I said, really holding forth now, “I have often wondered what makes a musician choose to haul around such a huge instrument as that. It must be impossible.” “No, I don’t play a double bass,” he replied. “I play the bass guitar. An electric one.” I was beginning to feel some unease with this Sting fellow, as if I’d put a foot wrong. “Do you… play in a group?” I asked. “Yes, with the Police,” he said. I broke into a broad grin. “You play in a police band?” I said. “Wow! How marvelous!” I have never fully recovered from the sheer embarrassment I suffered when word got out on the set about my exchange with one of the world’s biggest rock stars. A few years afterward, I saw Sting in concert at the Royal Festival Hall in London and was utterly exhilarated by his music. He has since forgiven me for that first conversation we had.""

mod13g5,1k4ux1u,reddit,"from wikipedia:

Alfond is often credited with the invention of the factory outlet store, having opened a shop at one of Dexter’s plants in 1971.[1] Because factories make mistakes, not all shoes pass quality control; these products are called factory seconds. The practice in the industry was to sell these shoes to jobbers for about a dollar a pair, who would then resell them for five times their cost.[citation needed] Alfond thought that was a pretty good mark-up, so in the 1960s he opened an outlet store at Dexter's Skowhegan factory and started selling his own factory seconds. Soon, the factories weren't making enough mistakes to supply the store, so Harold decided to put in stale inventory (first grade shoes that weren't selling in the wholesale market). This worked so well that Dexter's log-cabin-style outlet stores started appearing on all the heavily traveled roads throughout New England. Other manufacturers caught on to the idea and as Dexter put up new stores, other manufacturers would open their outlets next door. By the 1990s, the Dexter Factory Outlet chain had expanded to over 80 stores. About this time, Dexter also stopped building freestanding log cabins and began leasing stores in outlet malls.",2025-04-22 01:56:11,25,VeryNiceSmileDental,todayilearned

mocjwzb,1k4sx17,reddit,"(More facts from the url)

* In early telescopic observations, globular clusters appeared as fuzzy blobs, leading French astronomer Charles Messier to include many of them in his catalog of astronomical objects that he thought could be mistaken for comets. Using larger telescopes, 18th-century astronomers recognized that globular clusters are groups of many individual stars. Early in the 20th century, the distribution of globular clusters in the sky was some of the first evidence that the Sun is far from the center of the Milky Way.
* Both the origin of globular clusters and their role in galactic evolution are unclear. Some are among the oldest objects in their galaxies and even the universe, constraining estimates of the universe's age. Star clusters were formerly thought to consist of stars that all formed at the same time from one star-forming nebula, but nearly all globular clusters contain stars that formed at different times, or that have differing compositions. Some clusters may have had multiple episodes of star formation, and some may be remnants of smaller galaxies captured by larger galaxies.
* A large majority of the Milky Way's globular clusters are found in the halo around the galactic core. In 1918, Shapley used this strongly asymmetrical distribution to determine the overall dimensions of the galaxy. Assuming a roughly spherical distribution of globular clusters around the galaxy's center, he used the positions of the clusters to estimate the position of the Sun relative to the Galactic Center. He correctly concluded that the Milky Way's center is in the Sagittarius constellation and not near the Earth. He overestimated the distance, finding typical globular cluster distances of 10–30 kiloparsecs (33,000–98,000 ly); the modern distance to the Galactic Center is roughly 8.5 kiloparsecs (28,000 ly). Shapley's measurements indicated the Sun is relatively far from the center of the galaxy, contrary to what had been inferred from the observed uniform distribution of ordinary stars. In reality, most ordinary stars lie within the galaxy's disk and are thus obscured by gas and dust in the disk, whereas globular clusters lie outside the disk and can be seen at much greater distances.
* The count of known globular clusters in the Milky Way has continued to increase, reaching 83 in 1915, 93 in 1930, 97 by 1947, and 157 in 2010.",2025-04-22 00:16:32,10,fishoni,todayilearned

mlhsw2s,1jrvkv6,reddit,"I remember going to my grandmother's house in Wales and her toilet was in a shed at the end of the garden.

"" Until late Victorian times, houses were not constructed to include toilet facilities. Mains water and sewage systems hardly existed and one’s toilet was a function carried out using a chamber pot stored under the bed. If there was a toilet room it would be easier and less smelly to site it in the garden where the disposal of waste (often using council-run dung carts) was easier to manage.

Here’s an unappealing example.

So when the flushing toilet did arrive it was normal to add it on as an optional extra to the standard house layout, as a lean-to. It took Government action as late as the post-war era to see indoor toilets be made a minimum requirement for a new dwelling, and council grants in the 70s spurred many indoor conversions into bathrooms and shower rooms that incorporated a toilet. 

... according to a 2010 article in The Guardian, it is estimated by the Halifax that 40,000 homes in the UK still have an outside loo""

moyh410,1k798qw,reddit,"That reminds me of a rather heartbreaking tale, as told by Ie_Shima in a comment on [this video](https://youtu.be/FxRN2nP_9dA) of *Titanic*’s radio calls that night:

> A lot of grief being thrown at the Frankfurt here. She was a small ship, under 7500 tons, and still relied on sails to make up a good portion of her limited 13 knots. She didn't have the best wireless receiver but did have a very powerful transmitter, which meant she could send messages well beyond the range she could receive them.

>When the first CQD from Titanic went out Frankfurt could barely hear it, she was so far away that it came out garbled and almost unreadable. The Frankfurt's wireless operator could only make out the ship posting it's position and assumed that Titanic was asking for Frankfurt's in turn, a common practice to keep ships from colliding, so he got up and went to the bridge to get their most recent reading.
He missed Mount Temple's message, giving their position only 50 miles away. When he got back, he found the wireless chattering, nonstop. Wondering what the hell is going on, he posted his ship's position and asks, ""What is the matter with you?"" Seconds later, he was running back to the bridge to tell the captain that they need to move, a ship was sinking. He didn't receive Carpathia's message saying they are 58 miles off and making full steam. Even if he was at his post, Capathia is on the other side of Titanic, well outside Frankfurt's receiving range.

>All Frankfurt knows is that a ship is going down, that they are close by, and that they have a duty to respond. When he got back, transmissions were flooding in. Carpathia at 12:40 AM, only four hours away. He couldn't hear the message. Baltic at 1:15 AM, 243 miles away. Not close enough. Virginian at 1:20 AM, 170 miles away. Not close enough. All he knew was that Frankfurt was the closest ship at 120 miles and closing as fast as they can. Then, at 1:20 AM, water reached boiler room 4, forcing the stokers and engineers to abandon the room and retreat back to boiler room 3. The loss of these boilers cut steam to the dynamos powering the ship, dropping Titanic's transmitting range to below Frankfurt's receiving range. 1:23 AM was the last time Frankfurt heard from the Titanic, the liner's transmissions fading out to nothing. Olympic's exchange at 1:27 AM is the last time a ship within Frankfurt's receiving range confirms they got a response from Titanic.

>For the tiny German ship, this was a nightmare. Imagine hearing someone screaming for help in the distance, and as you rush to their aid, telling them to hold on, the screams just end. You were the one closest to the victim, and other people are calling out to them, but no one is telling you anything and you're only getting what you hope is half of a conversation. You don't know if someone has made it there in time, or if its already too late and you're calling out to the dead. All you can do is head east as fast as you can, begging for the victim to hold on, help is coming. For many onboard the Frankfurt, the Titanic was already gone, sunk just after Olympic's message exchange. All the little steamer can do was listen as ship after ship shouts out into the void, with no response back.

>Frankfurt didn't hear Titanic's message at 1:27 AM, saying that they are putting out lifeboats with women and children.

>Frankfurt didn't hear Titanic at 1:30 AM, saying that they are losing power and don't have much time left.

>Frankfurt didn't hear as the calls get more and more desperate, the engine room and boiler rooms filling with water.

>Frankfurt didn't hear Phillip's response to their question at 1:50 AM, only knowing that they may be the closest ship in the area.

>Frankfurt didn't hear the last transmission from the liner cut out at 2:17 AM as the radio room floods.

>Frankfurt arrived at the last position they received just after 11:00 AM. Her engines are worn out, her crew is exhausted, the galley staff is asleep at their posts surrounded by a mountain of fresh baked bread for the survivors, there are blankets and hot drinks waiting at the railings, and space has been made in every available part of the ship.

This process is being studied with the hope that mechanism present in arctic ground squirrels may provide a path for better preservation of human organs for transplant. The connections between brain cells also wither away in this state.

We also know that our system can't be proven to lack a contradiction. Or, at least it can't be proven to be consistent without the use of another, itself possibly inconsistent, system. And that means that, at any time, there is more undone math that could reveal a contradiction.

And we also know this has happened before - mathematicians presumed a system for centuries before realizing it was self-contradictory. It seems to me sheer luck that we so cleanly found an alternative when that occurred.

Given all that, I get why someone would just presume that there's *probably* a problem somewhere, no matter what sufficiently complex axiom system you're using, and that we need to just be okay with everything being both true and false simultaneously.",2025-04-03 09:41:09,1,AMWJ,todayilearned

>In 1978, Shin and Choi were kidnapped by order of Kim Jong-il, who wanted them to improve the North Korean film industry. The couple remained in captivity for 8 years and Shin directed seven films for Kim, including An Emissary of No Return, Runaway (both 1984), Love, Love, My Love, Salt, and Pulgasari (produced in 1985), before they escaped in 1986 and sought asylum in the United States. Shin gained American citizenship in 1989, and continued to produce films in the United States, now under his adopted name Simon S. Sheen.

**Mountain View Fire Department gets new tool to battle electric vehicle fires**

[https://www.ktvu.com/news/mountain-view-fire-department-gets-new-tool-to-battle-electric-vehicle-fires](https://www.ktvu.com/news/mountain-view-fire-department-gets-new-tool-to-battle-electric-vehicle-fires)

The tool slides under the floorboard, pierces the battery pack, and ***injects a stream of water directly inside.*** That allows firefighters to cool the inside of the battery, whereas before they could only submerge the outside in water.

***""So we could potentially use hundreds of gallons instead of thousands of gallons,""*** says Capt. George Mocak, with Mountain View Fire's Hazmat 55.

In addition to saving water, crews say it allows them to stand back, away from potentially toxic smoke.

***""So the firefighter is safer, the vehicle itself is going to be put out that much faster, and it's going to serve us that much more,""*** says Maitland.",2025-03-26 19:48:20,32,reddit455,todayilearned

mowkkkl,1k7a1bk,reddit,"It was difficult to fit all of that into the title, but this dude lived a *fascinating* life. The article is pretty short but I've done my best to distill it into three paragraphs below with links. tl;dr this dude was literally all over the map

He was born in Germany and got drafted and sent to the Eastern front, where he was captured by the Imperial Russian forces. After joining the October Revolution he became the first chairman of the [Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volga_German_Autonomous_Soviet_Socialist_Republic) which was an autonomous republic within Russia created for the [Volga Germans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volga_Germans) who had been in Russia for centuries (after the Nazi invasion of the USSR in 1941 they were sent en masse to the East or to prison camps, most who survived ended up in Kazakhstan).

Reuter returned to Germany a few years later and (re)joined left wing politics. He ran the Berlin subway for a period, then became mayor of Magdeburg (because why not) before the Nazis put him in an early concentration camp back when the majority of internees were genuinely political prisoners and before the industrial-scale murder hadn't started. In some ways the timing was lucky for him because Reuter was exiled to Turkey, whereas he probably would have just been killed a few years later (or if he had been more disruptive/unlucky, not trying to minimize even the early years of Nazi camps).

Following the conclusion of WWII Reuter returns once again to Germany, and to Berlin where he's again working on transportation with local government. This is happening at the start of the Cold War as tensions are rising between the Western Allies and USSR who have split occupied Germany into two zones (technically four but France/Britain/the US are okay at sharing and the first two are broke as hell at this point). Berlin is also split in two but it's entirely within East Germany. Following a dispute about jurisdiction (specifically the Deutsche Mark in West Berlin), the Soviets cut off the Allied portion of the city in the [Berlin Blockade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Blockade). Into the breach steps our boy Ernst who becomes spokesperson for West Berlin and rallies Western support for the city leading to the famous Berlin air drop. Ernst gets elected as the first mayor of West Berlin and does well enough to get re-elected before dying of a heart attack and having a million people attend his funeral.

A fascinating life - I'm not sure there could be anyone else who helped found a Soviet Republic and then went on to get elected to a position in Western Europe after WWII, let alone the position of first mayor of West Berlin. For some bonus trivia, his brother was a Volkisch (hyper-nationalist Nazi precursor) agitator and his son became CEO of Mercedes-Benz.",2025-04-25 02:37:55,61,BannibalJorpse,todayilearned

Quoting the article:

>The answers may be found in quasars. “We look at deep optical and infrared images of the sky,” says Professor McMahon. “We measure distance by looking at multiple images of the brightness of these quasars to see if it’s constant, and \[then\] measure the length of time \[light\] takes to get to Earth – we’re measuring delayed time five billion light years away.”

>Only a handful of quasars have been found so far, but as more and more are discovered, more data becomes available. “We need to find around 100 quasars to really start to build up a picture,” he says. “But that will happen in the next five to 10 years. We’ll monitor them every day – and that will really open up our understanding.”

**2025**... no it has not

mo7jkih,1k455mr,reddit,"[we know exactly why it works](https://www.uu.edu/dept/physics/scienceguys/2001Jan.cfm)


The mass of an object warps spacetime around it. That creates a ""line"" around the object where gravity is warped. Another object, say a planet, travels that line around the larger object, as every object will travel the path of least resistance, Newton's first law tought us that.


We perceive this travel along the line as gravity. The larger the object, the more curvature, the larger the ""gravity""



The biggest problem has been finding the gravitons, the little bits that give gravity it's power in a sense. [and just recently we might have caught a little glimpse of one](https://quantum.columbia.edu/news/researchers-find-first-experimental-evidence-graviton-particle-quantum-material)",2025-04-21 04:52:52,-7,unfinishedtoast3,todayilearned

moe73t4,1k455mr,reddit,"Gravity is a fundamental force of nature that causes matter to attract other matter. It arises from the mass of particles—every atom has a tiny gravitational pull, and when trillions of atoms come together, their combined pull becomes significant. Over time, this force causes dust and particles in space to clump together, forming planets, stars, and other celestial bodies. As these masses grow, their gravitational fields strengthen, drawing in even more matter. In essence, gravity is the cumulative effect of mass pulling on mass—a force born from the collective attraction of atoms working in unison.


Atoms are attracted to each other because they carry positive and negative bonds based on electrons. Different atoms clump together with others to create strong bonds..
And bam that is gravity.  


If you're trying to find another reason...well it's hard to explain something further if you don't have evidence that says there is another cause or force.  ",2025-04-22 07:19:03,0,GamingWithBilly,todayilearned

A [slightly more detailed article](https://resources.culturalheritage.org/osg-postprints/v03/scott/) calls it electrochemical replacement plating:


> Laboratory studies by Heather Lechtman have demonstrated the feasibility of the technique, which depends on the ability of the ancient metalsmiths to obtain gold in solution without the use of strong mineral acids, which would have been unavailable at the time. The thoroughly cleaned copper object must then have been dipped into the gold solution, following pH adjustment The reason for the pH adjustment is that the initial gold solution, employing minerals such as ferric sulphate and alum has a very low pH, perhaps 2-4, and would be too corrosive to copper without first raising the pH to a more alkaline level, such as pH 8-9.


This still isn't great. I think the idea is that you make a highly acidic solution, dissolve gold in it, then make it more basic, so the gold is no longer stable in solution, then dunk an item in it, and let the gold precipitate on the item.

The “functional” name, a name that describes what the product actually does and is therefore much easier to market and sell, would have been AppBuilder. ... But AppBuilder didn’t light up people’s imagination. It didn’t work well internationally – functional names are only functional in their language of origin.

>Thankfully, a few months before Delphi was scheduled for release Novell shipped their own product called Visual AppBuilder. There was much rejoicing in the Borland halls, for at last the “AppBuilder” debate was laid to rest. With the functional name taken out of the running, suggestions started coming from all quarters to use the Delphi codename as the product name.

>Delphi wasn’t home-free yet. The lead marketing person had legitimate concerns about the extra effort that would be required to build name recognition in the marketplace for an “iconic” (opposite of functional) product name, so he requested a vote of the development team. There was only one vote against (guess who?). Much to our chagrin, someone came to the conclusion that the development team’s views were not an accurate representation of the marketplace (“sample error” was the phrase I heard), and pressed for a survey of the beta testers. When that poll didn’t produce the result he wanted, the survey was broadened again to include Borland’s international subsidiaries, press, market analysts, stock analysts, corporate accounts, software retailers, and probably a few K-Mart shoppers.
