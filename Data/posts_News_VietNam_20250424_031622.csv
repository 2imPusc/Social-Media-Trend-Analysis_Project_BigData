VietNam,1jyul4n,Witnessing a Tragedy in Da Nang – A Wake-Up Call,"This morning around 10 AM in Da Nang, I took a short break from my online work to pick up some cigarettes and visit a pharmacy. Everything was normal, routine even. I got what I needed, called a Grab motorbike, and headed back to my hotel.

On the way back, I witnessed something I’ll never forget.

A woman was lying in the middle of the street, covered in blood, her motorbike destroyed beside her. She had just been hit by a car. Her eyes were still open, but she was clearly gone. And what shook me to my core wasn’t just the accident, it was the man who hit her. He stood there, smiling at the police, as if he had just bumped into a lamppost. No remorse. No horror. Just... indifference.

People were standing around filming. Taking photos. Some medical help had arrived, but it was already too late. A woman lost her life in the middle of a busy road, and it felt like the world just kept turning. She might have been a mother. A wife. Heading to work to support her family. Now she’s gone. Just like that. A family shattered in an instant, and for what?

I’ve lived and driven in several countries. I spent three years riding a motorbike in Thailand without a license. I’ve been hit before, got up, and kept going. I’ve driven through chaos in cities like Istanbul, experienced sketchy areas in Mexico and Manila, but nothing, and I mean nothing, has made me feel as unsafe as the roads here in Vietnam.

This place has an entirely different level of danger. Children, literal 10-year-olds, are driving scooters. No turn signals. No awareness. People just honk and hope you understand what they’re about to do. You constantly feel like your life depends on guessing right. I’ve never been so on edge in traffic before.

And the worst part? There’s a systemic indifference. That man who took a life today is probably back home with his family right now, having dinner, sleeping soundly, while another family is grieving the unimaginable. And he smiled.

He smiled.

To any tourist or expat reading this: This is not like Thailand or other Southeast Asian countries. I wish someone had told me how different it would be. The driving culture here isn’t just chaotic, it’s dangerous. It feels lawless. And the terrifying truth is, if something happens to you, the odds of accountability are slim, especially if you're a foreigner.

This isn’t an attack on Vietnamese people as individuals. I’ve met good, kind-hearted souls here. But there is a deeply troubling cultural disconnect when it comes to road safety, personal responsibility, and even basic modern infrastructure. I’ve had people stare in awe at my metal Revolut card like it was some kind of alien artifact. It's 2025. How is this still a reality?

A friend once made a harsh comparison about the driving mentality here. At the time, I thought he was being ignorant and offensive. But today, after what I saw, I understand what he meant. It’s not about race or people, it’s about mindset. A mindset where human life feels disturbingly disposable.

This is my last visit to Vietnam. I’ve seen a lot in my travels, violence, crime, poverty. But I’ve never experienced such a deep-rooted lack of empathy and awareness on the roads as I have here. Today shook me to the core.

To the woman who lost her life today: I didn’t know you, but I’m so, so sorry. You deserved better.

To everyone else: Don’t take your safety for granted. This isn’t just about traffic, it’s about humanity.",1608,0.92,479,2025-04-14 09:19:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1jyul4n/witnessing_a_tragedy_in_da_nang_a_wakeup_call/,ofella3

VietNam,1jq53qs,90% Tariff is Fake Math,"If you missed it earlier, Trump has claimed that Vietnam has 90% tariffs on American goods while simultaneously enacting a ""reciprocal"" blanket tariff of 46% on all Vietnamese goods imported to America.

All of the claimed foreign tariffs are fake and do not reflect any real implemented tariffs by any country. Vietnam does not have 90% tariffs on any American good.

The ""tariff"" numbers on the chart for every country is trade deficit divided by trade exports. [According to the Office of US Trade Representative](https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/southeast-asia-pacific/vietnam), America imports from Vietnam is $136.6 billion and exports to Vietnam is $13.1 billion. The deficit is export minus imports. (13.1-136.6)/136.6 = -90%

You can do this for every other country that America is implementing tariffs on. [For China](https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/china-mongolia-taiwan/peoples-republic-china), American exports were $143.5 billion while Chinese imports were $438.9 billion. (143.5 - 438.9) / 438.9 = -67%, matching the claims. Any country that America somehow had a trade surplus with was slapped with a 10% tariff floor.

The numbers claimed by Trump are not reflective of actual implemented tariffs by any country. Trump is insinuating that the entire trade deficit that America has with every country is because of tariffs or currency manipulation, when that is not the case. The vast majority of the countries that Trump has enacted tarrifs on are simply poorer and smaller and whose citizens cannot consume as frivolously as America does. Many of these countries don't have any or low tariffs due to free trade deals. In the case of Ecuador, their national currency is literally the American dollar; they have no national currency to manipulate.

Please stop taking Trump's claims at face value. Do some research and critical thinking before repeating them.",1402,0.97,267,2025-04-03 00:58:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1jq53qs/90_tariff_is_fake_math/,jcow77

VietNam,1jjvout,Please show respect for local cultural norms,"Dear Digital Nomads & Budget Travellers,

You are free to enjoy beautiful and hospitable Vietnam, delicious local food, and an affordable lifestyle there and across Southeast Asia as guests on a budget.

If you don’t like Vietnam or its local culture norm, you can always stay-in your 5 stars hotel suite and dine in fine restaurants or are free to leave Vietnam. However, if you choose to stay there for months because of the affordability then please show some respect for the local cultural norms. Displays of superiority, judgmental behavior, and arrogant attitude are not welcome. 

I’ve noticed a rise in uncalled-for posts and condescending comments in this subreddit from people who seem to forget they are the ones benefiting from Vietnam’s affordability and hospitality.

For a while i used to live in france and ive been to germany, then i moved to the US, and nothing has changed, i even saw people going on vacation in VN spelling it that way. no matter where i am, everywhere i go (both in real life and online) i always see “bahn mi.” Im not even exaggerating it makes me FURIOUS.

No one is asking for perfect pronunciation and accent marks. But how difficult is it to copy four letters: b…a… n… h… and accept that other languages exist? You would think we were asking rocket science from these people especially those who insist they’re correct or who continue to misspell even when the word is in front of them.

When i read food reviews and travel guides people are always recommending “the best bahn mi:)” and the more popular it gets the more people find out about it and spread their misspelling, even other asian people. It’s literally four letters long, i get that the “nh” spelling is not common in english so it’s a LITTLE harder for them but they shouldn’t be surprised other languages exist and also the same people have no trouble spelling Dostoyevsky. And even worse for french when they literally gave us this word due to their colonization and now they can’t even spell our version right 🥲

They don’t even need to spell it with the accents like bánh mì or even pronounce it correctly. but at LEAST just arrange the four letters in order like sometimes it is even already written out in front of them, and they still write BAHNMI:) I’m so annoyed because it’s the bare minimum they could do if they wanted to engage with the culture and consume the food, it’s simply about respecting the language and history, and also just the fact that soon it will probably become acceptable to misspell it because so many people are doing it 😐",478,0.87,285,2025-04-14 22:28:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1jzbwph/im_so_sick_and_tired_of_bahn_mi/,Muted_Summer_2231

That doesn’t mean you can’t find amazing experiences and great value—it’s actually pretty easy. But you do need to research properly. Relying on Google reviews alone isn’t enough. Use video platforms like Instagram or TikTok, check travel forums, or if possible book in person.

Even when reviews are real, they’re often manufactured. We’ve had multiple places ask us to leave a review on the spot, sometimes with the added pressure of, “If you say something bad, I’ll lose my job.” Others offer little perks like a free chocolate or discount in exchange for a 5-star rating.

Hotel photos? Often AI-enhanced—or in some cases, completely AI-generated.

Even Reddit isn’t safe. Just look up Ha Giang Loop company reviews, and you’ll see a flood of suspiciously positive comments from company shill accounts.

VietNam,1k04bu3,China's Xi urges Vietnam to oppose 'bullying' as Trump mulls more tariffs,"
China's President Xi Jinping has called on Vietnam to oppose ""unilateral bullying"" to upkeep a global system of free trade - though he stopped short of naming the US.

It comes as Xi is on a so called ""charm offensive"" trip across South East Asia, which will also see him visit Malaysia and Cambodia.

Though the trip was long-planned, it has taken on heightened significance in the wake of a mounting trade war between the US and China. Vietnam was facing US tariffs of up to 46% before the Trump administration issued a 90-day pause last week.

US President Donald Trump called Xi's meeting with Vietnamese leaders a ploy to figure out how to ""screw the United States of America"".

According to state media outlet Xinhua, Xi told Vietnam's Communist Party Secretary-General To Lam to ""jointly oppose unilateral bullying"".

""We must strengthen strategic resolve... and uphold the stability of the global free trade system as well as industrial and supply chains,"" he said.
Stephen Olson, a former US trade negotiator, said Xi's comments were ""a very shrewd tactical move"".

""While Trump seems determined to blow up the trade system, Xi is positioning China as the defender of rules-based trade, while painting the US as a reckless rogue nation,"" he added.
Speaking to reporters in the Oval office on Monday, Trump said he does not ""blame"" China or Vietnam but alleged that they were focused on how to harm the US.

""That's a lovely meeting. Meeting like, trying to figure out, how do we screw the United States of America?"" said Trump.

The world's two largest economies are locked in an escalating trade battle, with the Trump administration putting tariffs of 145% on most Chinese imports earlier this month. Beijing later responded with its own 125% tariffs on American products coming into China.

On Saturday, a US customs notice revealed smartphones, computers and some other electronic devices would be excluded from the 125% tariff on goods entering the country from China.

But Trump later chimed in on social media saying there was no exemption for these products and called such reports about this notice false. Instead, he said that ""they are just moving to a different tariff 'bucket'"".

#  A 'golden opportunity' for Xi
Xi arrived in Hanoi on Monday, where he was welcomed by well wishers waving Chinese and Vietnamese flags.

He then met top Vietnamese officials including the country's Secretary-General and Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh.

Earlier on Tuesday, Xi visited the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum to take part in a wreath laying ceremony at the resting place of the former Vietnamese founder and Communist leader.

Despite Xi's visit, Vietnam will be careful to ""manage the perception that it is colluding with China against the United States, as the US is too important a partner to put aside,"" said Susannah Patton, Director of the Southeast Asia Program at the Lowy Institute think-tank.

""In many ways, China is an economic competitor as well as an economic partner for South East Asian economies,"" she added.

Xi has now left Vietnam and will arrive in Malaysia later on Tuesday. He is expected to meet the country's King, as well as its Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.

It comes as Malaysian mobile data service company U Mobile said it will roll out the country's second 5G network by using infrastructure technology from China's Huawei and ZTE.
Ms Patton expects Xi to continue portraying the US as ""a partner which is unreliable [and] protectionist"".

Meanwhile, he is likely to ""portray China in stark contrast as a partner that is there"", she added.

""Now is really a golden opportunity for China to score that narrative win. I think this is how Xi's visit to Vietnam, Cambodia and Malaysia will be seen.""",331,0.95,139,2025-04-15 21:59:39,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdrgk2338dvo,MotherMilks99

Vietnamese are the best.

I have been to many cities here, from North to South, big cities to small one.

Where I'm from, you need to act cold and be tough in public to be respected.

I have never seen people like this.

They love life so much. I had the best service whenever I interacted with them in the streets, hotel and restaurant. They really want me to feel good.

When I'm walking in some area that are more remote, if I have an eye contact with them, they give me a big smile and say Hellooo, never asked for money. Some people wave at me just to send me positive vibes, without bad intentions.

I feel safe everywhere, even at night. When there is a language barrer, they use the translator app and make sure we understand each other.

For the first time, I don't feel like a walking wallet in a country, and I love it.

A few times when I was paying, I mistaken the 10k bill and the 100k bill, they look alike. Never tried to scam me. My change was always exact.

They are genuinely kind people.

Thanks for the best vacation in all my years on this earth! I will come back with friends 100%.

VietNam,1k2yram,Địa đạo (2025) is incredible - Vietnam movie making at it's finest. Especially after 5 decades of Hollywood overdose of Americans in the Vietnam War,"Just came out of the theater having watched this, and words fail me utterly. The movie captures claustrophobia better than Das Boot (1981), the horrors of war better than Paths of Glory (1957), sheer bleakness of soldiers as well as 1917 (2019), and probably a pioneer war movie in showing how women play an equal role in the fights and heroics but are so so often overlooked.

Yeah, I realise there are other (some might claim propaganda) reasons for the launch of the movie, but it stands just as poignant today as it would have at any other time. The film making especially is absolutely top notch, better than most of the gimmick shit we are overdosed on by Hollywood execs for a tiny fraction of the budget. The protagonists are shown as real humans, doing mundane daily stuff in the middle of horrors, some with terrible flaws - not at all the Rambo-like portrayal we have come to see in some many others. 

Cannot recommend this movie enough, no matter what your nationalist views may be. My second ever foreign language 10/10 movie (amongst over 2000)",247,0.84,53,2025-04-19 15:24:50,https://i.redd.it/3n1dfs3r7tve1.jpeg,inwarded_04

Was walking home at 3am and couldn’t get a grab driver through the app. On my way someone wearing a grab outfit stopped and offered to give me a lift for cash. 

He told me I could hold onto his shoulders for support, so I did. I was sniffly and sad because I’d had a bad night and he seemed to notice, so during the ride he took my hands and put them around his waist and put his hand on my hand. I thought it was unusual but i thought he was trying to comfort me. I thought it was a nice gesture, albeit odd. Hindsight is 20/20 and I was obviously too trusting and not as vigilant as I unfortunately need to be. I was distressed and just wanted to believe this stranger cared.

He dropped me at my destination and I tipped him. He asked me if I was okay, I said I just had a bad night, he offered some comforting words and went in for a hug. When he hugged me he grabbed my bottom and kissed my neck.

I’m a sexual abuse victim and it’s brought up all kinds of horrible feelings and thoughts. Idk why I’m sharing this. I just feel really sad about it. 

I suppose I’m lucky that he didn’t take me anywhere or do anything more. In future, I won’t try to go home so late at night when it’s difficult to book through the app.

VietNam,1jn4i96,Any Viet Kieus married into a rich family? If so how was it like?,"Hi guys I am in a dilemma, my uncle and parents are setting me up for marriage with a girl in Vietnam. Our families known each other for a while, her grandma and my grandpa were really close when he was still alive back in Vietnam before he left for the states. My mom knew her mom growing too, due to my grandpa and her grandma close relationship. So I guess our family goes way back. My cousins from the states somehow know their family as well and when they visited Vietnam recently they stayed over at one of their houses. Supposedly her family is insanely rich and would like to send her off for marriage. Their only criteria is they have is a good person and has faith, which my uncle has vouched for me. They don't care about wealth at all. However, I just don't know how I would interact with her, we come from very different economic backgrounds. I'm middle class and she's way above that. She literally is living in a house with an elevator like wtf. I would just feel bad that would not be able to provide the life she has over there compared to the states. Has anyone here married into a wealthy family and if so how is your relationship? 

Minor update: My uncle spoke to my mom and after speaking with her mother, if everything goes smoothly and if we're compatible. She will fly us out here and told don't worry about spending anything. When we are going to visit. My mother declined because it feels awkward and I agreed as well.


Probably FINAL update on this: her mother wants me to move over there if the marriage were to happen, due to her husband being gone and she only has her daughter and her son left. My uncle say no to that and say why not marry a guy in over there and she was speechless lol. So, I guess this Crazy Asians Story has come to an end. Even though it was very short lived, I enjoyed reading the comments and people sharing their experiences. Also, I just don't see me myself living over there and I'll be all by myself and I can see their perspective as well. With her being over in the states by herself.

VietNam,1jv07j5,How Trump tariffs could push Vietnam into the arms of China,"The move has sent shock waves through a region of US strategic importance that had respected Trump as tough on Beijing

Vietnam had tried to appease Donald Trump: tariffs on US goods were reduced; regulations were passed to allow Elon Musk’s SpaceX to launch its Starlink in the country. The prime minister, Pham Minh Chinh, even joked in January that he would happily “play golf all day long” at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home in Florida if it could “bring benefits to my country and my people”.

The strategies do not appear to have worked. Trump has inflicted an extraordinary 46% tariff on Vietnam that threatens to devastate its economic growth plans and undermine relations between the two countries. The tariff has sent shock waves through Vietnam, a manufacturing powerhouse where Trump has always been fairly popular, and across south-east Asia.

Across the region, which is highly dependent on exports, Trump is introducing similarly punishing tariffs, including in Cambodia (49%), Laos (48%), Thailand (36%), Indonesia (32%), Malaysia (24%), Brunei (24%), the Philippines (17%), and Singapore (10%).

The announcement has damaged the US’s reputation as a reliable partner in the region, said Kevin Chen an associate research fellow with the US programme at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, in Singapore. The Trump administration’s approach was “unilateral, coercive, and undermines the trading system that countries in this region prospered under”, Chen said.

South-east Asia is a strategically important region for the US, especially in light of Washington’s competition with China and tensions in the South China Sea.

Vietnam and the US had grown closer under Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, with the two countries upgrading their partnership. Trump is known to be well liked in Vietnam, where his books are translated into Vietnamese, and he has gained respect as a businessman and as a politician tough on China.

Yet relations between the US and south-east Asia have been undermined in recent months. The tariff announcement comes on top of the gutting of USAID and other foreign assistance programmes, which halted life-saving projects across the region.

America’s image has also been damaged in recent years in countries including the Muslim-majority Malaysia and Indonesia, owing to Washington’s support for Israel during its war on Gaza. US companies have been targeted with prolonged boycotts in both countries.

China is expected to try to capitalise on the chaos. Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, is due to visit Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia this month and “will likely use the opportunity to portray China as a steadfast and reliable partner in contrast to the US”, Chen said. A slew of economic agreements are expected to be signed between China and those countries by the end of his visit.

In the longer term, whether China can leverage frustration in south-east Asia is less straightforward, say analysts, especially as Beijing risks becoming embroiled in a worsening trade war with its superpower rival.

Trump has threatened China with an extra 50% tariff, which will exacerbate the economic difficulties already affecting dynamics between China and its south-east Asian neighbours.

Peter Mumford, the head of practice for south-east Asia at Eurasia Group, said the region was “grappling with a flood of low-cost Chinese goods, and that’s going to get even more complicated”. The oversupply of cheap goods, from clothing to steel, had damaged small businesses and contributed to hundreds of factories closing in Thailand.

South-east Asian leaders will seek to diversify by looking to Europe or Japan, say analysts, while also scrambling to negotiate with Trump.

It is unclear what countries such as Vietnam can offer to placate Washington. Vietnam’s trade surplus with the US has surpassed $123bn, a figure that has grown rapidly over recent years as companies moved there from China to skirt tariffs imposed by the previous Trump administration.

“Trump would likely push Vietnam to commit to purchasing significantly more American goods and services. As Vietnam has been seen as a conduit for China to bypass US tariffs, the Trump administration may also demand that Vietnam restrict transshipment of Chinese goods,” said Phan Xuan Dung, research officer of the Vietnam Studies Programme at the ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute, in Singapore.

Vietnam was doing its best to negotiate to persuade the US to reduce the tariffs, said Khang Vu, a visiting scholar in the political science department at Boston College. But, he added, the US tariffs would “damage the Vietnamese government’s goodwill toward the Trump administration”.

He said Trump’s tariffs on Vietnamese goods showed Hanoi that, despite everything Washington had said of Vietnam’s regional importance, their partnership was “dispensable”.

Countries in the region would be cautious about leaning too closely to China, already south-east Asia’s largest trading partner. In the past the US had served as a counterbalance in the region. “The major difference this time,” said Chen, “is that they will need to account for a potentially unfriendly, if not hostile United States as well as an assertive China.”",169,0.91,142,2025-04-09 07:40:39,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/08/how-trump-tariffs-could-push-vietnam-into-the-arms-of-china,MotherMilks99

VietNam,1jsoii5,Let's keep vietnamese pregnant women safe from their family,"I keep hearing stories of pregnancy going horribly wrong mostly because of family pressuring the woman with stupid superstitions. Yes there are stupid advice all around the world, but in Vietnam questioning those advice is a declaration of war with your family (to not say your mother in law in most cases). I've heard countless depressions due to the absurd regime their family was forcing them into, with obesity due to the obvious unbalance. I've heard babies refusing to drink their mother milk because the mother only drinks ""traditional"" herbal preparations. I've heard women suffering severe infections after delivery because they're forbidden to take shower. I've heard countless practices that sound and are outright dangerous (hot charcoal, vagina steaming, ...). Every doctor has to tell people over and over that those absurd practices are dangerous, and write it down on every paper they give you.  And lately I've heard a woman being pressured to have ""normal"" delivery despite her doctor insisting on an early C-section. The baby died of asphyxia and she eventually had a C-section to deliver a dead baby. I'm pretty sure her family is now blaming her for the miscarriage. 

With that in mind, I think it's useful to remind everybody the following obvious facts:

Doctors know what they are doing more than anybody around you. They didn't hear it from their neighbors, they learnt a century legacy of countless doctors and midwives, who have experimented and carefully observed. Midwives have touched more babies than your grandma has ever seen, they're full of good advice, and clearly underpaid for that. 

Your family and your husband's family can be literal baby killers. They will always prioritize their ego to you and your baby's health. If your husband cannot stand up against his family, don't even consider having a child with him. If your family cannot respect you, don't let them get any close to you, block them and don't let them see your baby until they apologize. 

If traditional medicine and grandma recipes were any useful, the infant mortality wouldn't have been divided by 4 during the last 50 years by the introduction of modern medicine. All traditional medicine in the world have at some point poisoned their clients with mercury and lead with the same confidence as they sell you remedies today. You could drop dead in front of their eyes, they would keep selling the same remedies telling that you would be alive if you took twice more. 

Everybody should know what is a good diet, it is displayed in every school: plenty of carbohydrates, vegetables and fruits, and reasonable amount of meat, fish or milk. The fact that your family doesn't know that shows how ignorant they are. Only restrict yourself if the doctor tells you to, don't abuse anything. One glass of milk a day will get you tons of benefits, one litter of milk will destroy your health. 

People will try everything to sell useless or even dangerous services to a young mom desperate to do the best for her baby. Vagina steaming and warmth applied on the belly will damage your vagina that is trying to heal. Your baby doesn't need 1h bath, it wants it as fast as possible. Don't pay for anything that your doctor hasn't explicitly advised. If they can, they will take more money from you than your hospital. 

The mental health of a pregnant woman / young mother is as important as the health of the baby. Eat ice-cream and anything that makes you feel happy. Even few sushis are much less harmful than a depression. The only people who should feel pressure are the family and friends who should suffer the wrath of a moody woman, not the woman who is bearing a child. 

So please everybody take care of the pregnant women around you and protect them from their family. ",149,0.92,36,2025-04-06 07:17:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1jsoii5/lets_keep_vietnamese_pregnant_women_safe_from/,arllt89

Getting gas for motorcycle. Attendant fills up my tank. VERY quickly moves on to the next tank without getting my money yet.

I look at screen, give him 50k, and he gets upset. I point to screen. First tells me I owe 120k, looks shifty while doing so. I have never paid this much to fill up my bike. A dude pulls up next to me and knows English, so begins to translate. The two go back and forth for quite a while. English speaking dude tells me I owe 40k more. So essentially the attendant lowers total amount to 90k. I give him 40k more just to be done with it all. Again, this isn’t about the money.

VietNam,1ju84mw,"Vietnam to buy US defence, security products to tackle trade gap","HANOI, April 8 (Reuters) - Vietnam will buy more American goods, including defence and security products, and has asked for a 45-day delay in the imposition of U.S. tariffs, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh said in a statement issued late on Monday.

Hanoi will also seek faster deliveries of commercial planes that Vietnamese airlines have ordered from the U.S., Chinh said at a cabinet meeting late on Monday.

The Southeast Asian country, a major regional manufacturing base for many Western companies, last year had a trade surplus of more than $123 billion with the U.S., its largest export market.

Chinh said Vietnam had asked the U.S. to delay the 46% tariff rate that U.S. President Donald Trump announced last week to allow time for negotiations.

Vietnam was seeking to ""negotiate with the U.S. side for balanced and sustainable trade, in line with the interests of the two sides,"" the statement said.

White House trade adviser Peter Navarro highlighted major concerns on Monday, including transhipping from China, the dumping of seafood and other goods, and intellectual property issues.

""They engage in intellectual property theft,"" Navarro told CNBC, regarding Vietnam. ""They have the biggest number of cases aside from China at the Department of Commerce on the dumping.""

In Monday's statement, Chinh said Vietnam would review issues such as its monetary policy, exchange rate, non-tariff barriers and ensuring the correct origin of goods, in line with the concerns aired by Navarro.

In a statement on Tuesday, following a tariff task force meeting, the government said Vietnam was also considering adjustments to its current bilateral trade agreement with the United States, adding content on tax and intellectual property.

The country's benchmark stock index (.VNI), opens new tab has fallen nearly 14% since Trump's announcement of the tariffs on April 2. The index fell 6.26% to 1,135 in early trade on Tuesday.

On Friday, Trump and Vietnam's leader To Lam agreed to discuss a deal to remove tariffs, both leaders said after a telephone call that Trump described as ""very productive"".

Since an arms embargo was lifted in 2016, U.S. defence exports to Vietnam have been largely limited to coastguard ships and trainer aircraft.

Last year sources said there were talks on sales of Lockheed Martin C-130 Hercules military transport planes to Hanoi.

VietNam,1k5jty5,U.S. Tells Its Diplomats in Vietnam to Avoid War Anniversary Event,"The reversal adds another Trump administration blow to decades of reconciliation efforts.

The Trump administration has told its senior diplomats in Vietnam not to take part in events marking the 50th anniversary of the end of the war.

Four U.S. officials who insisted on anonymity to describe sensitive diplomatic decision-making said that Washington had recently directed senior diplomats — including Marc Knapper, the U.S. ambassador to Vietnam — to stay away from activities tied to the anniversary on April 30.

That includes a hotel reception on April 29 with senior government leaders and an elaborate parade the next day — gatherings hosted by Vietnam in Ho Chi Minh City, also known as Saigon, where the war ended with South Vietnam’s surrender.

Veterans returning to Vietnam have also been told they’re on their own, for public discussions they organize on war and reconciliation, and anniversary events. For many, it amounts to a sudden reversal after months of anticipation.

“I really don’t understand it,” said John Terzano, a founder of the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation who served two tours in Vietnam and has attended anniversary events for decades. “As a person who has dedicated his life to reconciliation and marveled at how it’s grown over the last 20 years or so, this is really a missed opportunity.”

“It really doesn’t require anything of the United States to just stand there,” Mr. Terzano added, in an interview after landing in Hanoi. “This is all ceremonial stuff — that’s what makes it sound crazy and disappointing.”

State Department and embassy officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

A half-dozen people with knowledge of the directive said it was not clear where it originated or why it had been issued.

April 30 is the 100th day of Mr. Trump’s second term. Some U.S. officials speculated that a Trump appointee or a State Department leader feared drawing attention away from that milestone with events that might highlight America’s defeat in a war that Mr. Trump managed to avoid.

In 1968, a year when 296,406 Americans were drafted into military service, Mr. Trump received a diagnosis of bone spurs in his heels that led to a medical exemption.

Regardless of the reasoning for Washington’s retreat from the 50th-anniversary events, it adds another blow to decades of painstaking diplomacy by Republican and Democratic administrations, which had sought to both heal the war’s wounds and build a strategic partnership for countering China.

Mr. Trump had already frozen U.S.A.I.D. money allocated for addressing the legacy of the war. Even after officials restored some of it, many programs — for finding missing soldiers and demining old battlefields, for example — are still struggling with layoffs and uncertainty.
The foundation of bilateral relations, built by veterans from both sides, has essentially been weakened.

It was their emotional and physical hard work, with visits and civil society partnerships in Vietnam, that had persuaded former enemy governments to work through complicated issues like unexploded ordnance, soldiers missing in action and the toxic legacy of Agent Orange and other American herbicides.
The momentum of postwar bonding led in 2023 to a new level of strategic partnership between the two nations. And the work had been on track to expand, until Mr. Trump’s approach to the world, pugilistic and allergic to the acknowledgment of errors, strained relations.

“It’s taken decades to build the current level of mutual trust and cooperation between the United States and Vietnam,” said George Black, the author of “The Long Reckoning,” a study of U.S.-Vietnam relations after the war. “And the whole process has been underpinned by our willingness to deal with the worst humanitarian legacies.”

Mr. Knapper, the son of a Vietnam veteran who was sworn in as the U.S. ambassador in 2022, had embraced his diplomatic mission. As of a few weeks ago, he had been expected to attend the main anniversary events on April 29 and 30 alongside delegations from other countries, including Australia and the Netherlands.

He has often led ceremonies in which the United States gave artifacts from the war back to Vietnamese military families, and repatriated the remains of what were believed to be missing Americans.
In an essay for this month’s Foreign Service Journal, he wrote about traveling to Vietnam with his father and son in 2004, describing the trip as “a clear reminder of the sacrifices on both sides and the enduring importance of reconciliation.”

“As ambassador,” he added, “I believe that to truly strengthen our ties, we must engage deeply and directly with the people and leaders of Vietnam.”

With that goal in mind, before Mr. Trump took office, the two countries had planned to show off their hard-earned bond in a new exhibit at the War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City.

The museum, Vietnam’s most visited cultural institution, chronicles American war atrocities. Under the plan, one of its wings was to be transformed: Design blueprints aimed for a lively introduction to the activists and officials who helped forge a model of postwar recovery.
Organizers had hoped the ambitious exhibit would open this month, or at least by July 11, the 30th anniversary of the restoration of American diplomatic relations with Vietnam.

But it’s now in limbo. The project was funded by U.S.A.I.D., while the United States Institute of Peace managed the details. The Trump administration has dismantled both agencies.

“Reconciliation is in our economic, geopolitical and moral interest,” said Andrew Wells-Dang, a senior program officer at the peace institute who oversaw the museum project until he was fired a few weeks ago.

“U.S. government and nongovernmental partners alike,” he added, “are reeling from the effects of the new administration’s actions, leaving our Vietnamese colleagues distraught and confused.”

Vietnamese officials did not respond to requests for comment about the anniversary. But they have repeatedly nudged the United States toward responsibility for the war’s lingering impact, with some success. After high-level discussions, the Defense Department recently restored money it had set aside for war legacy issues, even though its administrative partner, U.S.A.I.D., is gone.

As a result, the cleanup process for contamination from Agent Orange at the Bien Hoa air base has been revived, at least for this year.

Mr. Trump’s tariffs, however, have added another layer of vexation. With a rate set at 46 percent for Vietnam — above nearly every other country — some U.S. officials thought Vietnam might disinvite diplomats to the anniversary events.

That did not happen. The tariffs are now paused, and the two countries are locked in negotiations, with Vietnam seeking a reprieve and U.S. officials pushing Hanoi to decouple from China.

Vietnam has often made clear that it would like to find room for its fierce independence and pursuit of prosperity.

The Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, recently visited Hanoi. The anniversary events could have provided a way for the United States and Vietnam to show that, despite a brutal war, they are still close strategic partners.

Instead, Vietnam is left to wonder how much it will now be asked to endure from its former adversary.

Mr. Terzano said that in a proud nation that cares deeply about symbolism, the U.S. decision to avoid the events looks “petty and nonsensical.”

He argued that the absence would strengthen the world’s gathering storm of doubt about America.

“You take a look at the chaos that has transpired,” he said. “Nations around the globe are all questioning: ‘Where is the U.S.? What does it mean?’”",367,0.96,117,2025-04-22 22:43:12,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/world/asia/us-diplomats-vietnam-war-anniversary-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare,MotherMilks99

VietNam,1jng5mt,Why were the old ladies rude to me when I was in ho chi minh,"I thought I would enjoy my solo travel in Ho Chi Minh City, but to my surprise, it became draining for me. Vietnamese people are nice—I’ve been to other countries, and I can say that I felt comfortable with how hospitable and helpful people are here despite the language barrier.  

I don’t want to generalize, but my interactions with older women in Ho Chi Minh left me exhausted. At Ben Thanh Market, while I was eating, an old lady grabbed my drink and told me to move to the corner so two white people could sit—even though there was clearly space for them. I almost cried because I felt discriminated against. When I asked her where I could buy clothes at a fair price, she just laughed at me and didn’t answer.  

At Cho Binh Tay Market, an old woman sold me a scrunchie for double the price and even signaled to her friend while pointing at me after I bought it. Another older woman at a clothing store stared at me from head to toe the entire time I was there, making me so uncomfortable that I left.  

I didn’t enjoy my time in Ho Chi Minh because these experiences drained my energy. Maybe it was because of my ethnicity, or maybe I’m just overthinking things since I was alone. Still, I felt comfortable with people my age or younger—they were so nice and hospitable. I just had a lot of negative experiences with older women there. I love traveling, but I hate when these things happen because I love exploring countries and cultures. Experiences like this make me scared to try new things or visit unfamiliar places.

EDIT: And there are people here invalidating my experience calling me the r word, b”tch, entitled, sensitive or there’s something wrong with me.  If you had a nice experience that’s nice and I wish you the best, but I had a different one and Im just sharing my experience here. Vietnam is literally richer than the country I came from, I don’t live a comfortable life, I’m not rich and I’m not white. I asked why, now im thankful for the nice people that educated me more about the culture, shared their experience, uplifted me and understood what happened.

VietNam,1jqcfia,"Too foreign for home, too foreign for here. Yet never enough for both","Hi, I recently visited VN after 10+ years of living overseas and it was rather a heartbreaking experience (or maybe I’m just overtly sensitive ?).
I was born and raised in the deep south, small little village where community really meant everyone knew everyone and every day was pretty mundane. But it was peaceful, and I was always a happy child. 
Moved to the states during my teens, and of course had my fair share of struggles coming from a small Viet town, with no English, both parents with little to no money, no skills that were valued in the States.
Anyways, fast forward to now, in my mid 20s, and I was so excited to come back home. Yet I was treated with such distant from the folks back home. They look at me like the other, and oddly enough, just giving me the worst attitudes. When it comes to family, everyone was extremely critical of everything I say & do. When I invite them out to eat, everyone said the place served bad food, when I bring them coffee, oh the coffee sucks. 

I speak the language perfectly fine, I can communicate affectively. So all of this comes to me as a shock. It’s like folks here (in my small town) didnt like me, but truly I didn’t say or do anything that I thought was offensive. I know the Viet community both in the US and back home value “saving face” and wealth is a big factor. I make average $, I don’t wear designer clothes, mid looking…etc. just a simple man. I was told by my parents that when I go out, make sure to give extra to cab drivers or young folks working at the restaurants. But when I do, they give me exact change and say they didn’t need it from someone like me? But when I dont, they call me a cheapskate for being “Viet kieu.”
Side note, when I was in Saigon, where I didn’t have any family and was just touring around, minding my business, every Viet person was very friendly and kind. So def not generalizing here. 
I expected the childhood that I left, hoping to find some sense of belonging and yet home never felt so different. I don’t feel at home in the US either.

Posting to see if anyone had a similar experience or has some insights on why I’m being treated this way, I’m sure my experience isn’t unique and again, maybe I’m just overtly sensitive.

VietNam,1juxhvu,Clearing assumptions about Ha Long/Lan Ha/Bai Tu Long bay,"I work in the bay and want to provide some information for everyone after seeing a lot of assumptions from post and comments.

1st off, the pollution in the bay, most of these pollutants doesn't actually come from tour boats, but the fisherman illegally living in floating houses and their aqua farms, there used to be around 3 thousands fishermen that lived in many floating villages in the bay that were moved outside from 2012-2018 but there are still a few hundred illegally living and farming in the bay, their house and farm float on polystyrene or styrofoam + bamboo, so when they replaced them with new ones, they just let the old ones freely drift.
They live in the middle of the sea, far from land, some of their children couldn't even go to school because of how far it is and how much fuel it cost for them each trip, so they don't bring any of their trash to land for disposal either, not saying i condone anything, just that i understand why they do this.
That's not to say none of the pollutants comes from the tourism, i've seen both tourist and sometimes the crew throw things in the water, although it's rare for the crew to do so because if they get caught, the fines are very large and the boat might get suspended, tourism make up a very very small portion of pollutants, in fact, they are what saving the bay.
Which brings me to what's being done about it, there are people at the harbor and boats in the bay paid to pick up the pollutants everyday as they come in with the tides, at sun harbor they don't allow tourist to bring plastic bottles on the boats, and as i've mentioned before, they relocated and disband all the floating villages in the bay, which is good for the environment as before this, there were much much more pollutants in the bay, but horrible for the fisherman who daily lives depends on fishing in the bay.
All of this is payed for by the tourism, if there were no tourist here and if they didn't complain, nothing would be done about it and there wouldn't be any funding to do anything, like so many other place that's not a tourist hot spot in Vietnam, some of the pollutants comes from the surrounding province because they don't have the money from tourism that Quang Ninh has to even try to clean up, the tour boats are taxed for cleaning the bay, for how many berrel of trash they disposed of everyday at the harbor, and there's a fee for selling plactic water bottle and drinks on the boats as well, compared to 10 years ago, the bay is much cleaner now, but there is still much to improve, the important thing to remember is that there are improvements, it just takes time.

2nd, access to the bay, the bay is not an open area where you can come and go as you please, if you want to enter, you need to buy a ticket or have permission to work here, the tour boats can't just go wherever and whenever they want, they have to follow government regulation, there are 4 route the boats can register to visit and designated parking area, sleeping area, kayaking and swimming area, this is why you see all the boats going the same way and stopping at the same spots.
There's a limit of 500 boats in Ha Long, it's currently full with 170 overnight boats and 330 day boats, 200 limit in Lan Ha with all 200 slot registered but only around 60 boats current running, the rest have not come out yet, there are like, 13 boats on average in Bai Tu Long because it's very far from land, but they are planning on bumping that number up to 100 this year, i'm not sure if these will be new boats or they are just gonna move boats from Ha Long to Bai Tu Long.
Yes it's crowded, but Ha Long is the #1 destination in Vietnam, i legit get people who told me there should be private boat that go to a private area where there are no one else, that's like me going to Paris and not expecting crowd of tourist and demanding private experience at the Eiffel tower.

3rd, the different bays, Ha Long and Bai Tu Long belongs to Quang Ninh province while Lan Ha belongs to Hai Phong city, they're under different management, regulations, ticket prices, they compete against each other for tourists, hence the tour boats can only register to go to one or the other. 
In term of scenery, there's not much difference, however Ha Long has the biggest cave, a beach, and an island you can climb to the top on, and Lan Ha give you access to visit Cat Ba island.
The Movie ""kong skull island"" was filmed in Ha Long using helicopter, planes and boats, there are no movie set or island they filmed on, the 2005 Peter Jackson King Kong was not filmed here and the James Bond island is in Thailand, not Ha Long.
The weather is sunny or raining from may to November and cloudy or foggy from December to April, although it hasn't been consistent in recent years.

If you have any questions, put them in the comments and i'll try to answer if i can, hope this was helpful.",95,0.93,40,2025-04-09 04:32:20,https://i.redd.it/pxshixw7mqte1.jpeg,TomiShinoda

VietNam,1k2b2t5,Too difficult to live in Vietnam as a foreigner these days?,"My own thoughts:

- Difficult economy: less hours, harder to find a job & lots of competition for work, wages stagnant (in real terms, going backwards in some cases). 

- Difficult paperwork: everything from licences to work permits to TRCs and everything in-between is either more difficult than in the past, or the rules are always changing rapidly & unexpected.

- Banking: the moment your visa turns over, your account is frozen. (Only country where this has ever happened to me personally. Particularly galling as it's all taxed income.)

- Friendliness: sentiment is that Saigon and Hanoi are not 'friendly' cities these days. Much, much harder to make local viet friends than in the past. 

Interested in hearing feedback.

I only post this as I am curious to see the opinion of foreigners at the current time. Especially those that have lived in Vietnam for some time.

Not intended as a critique of Vietnam (adding this as I know some people will jump down my throat) but as a realistic summerization of foreigners in Vietnam and their thoughts.

VietNam,1jmkax8,Loved Vietnam !!,"TLDR: Loved Vietnam. Leaving Vietnam with a heavy heart. I will definitely come back.  

I (27M) came to Vietnam for a short trip with my friends. We were just able to visit HCMC, Da Nang and Hanoi.

Things I loved :
1) Everywhere we visited, the people were VERY friendly and welcoming.
2) The rich cultural heritage left me awestruck.
3) Don't even get me started on the Vietnamese coffee ! I don't know how many of that I have had in the past week.
4) The party scene was quite good.
5) The weather was pleasant and amazing.

I couldn't try out the local cuisine as much as I wanted to because of some dietary preferences. I also couldn't visit a few places because of the trip during being short.

I had heard of some scams before visiting but my experience was completely positive.

Personally, I just wish the sex tourism was less common. It is just a personal opinion.

I hope we respected the local culture and norms and didn't offend anyone.

VietNam,1jugrn7,"Can I live in Vietnam for 6 months on $4,000","Hi, my situation is really bad. My father doesn’t respect or value me at all. My university is trying to expel me because I discovered a vulnerability in their system (even though I was the one who reported it to them). I’ve been dealing with this issue for over a year and a half, and my final attempt will be in court next month. I’ll be defending myself without a lawyer.

But that's not my main concern.

Over the past four years, I managed to save $4,000 by developing a game. I’m from Saudi Arabia, and if I lose the case, I’m planning to move to Vietnam for six months.

My question is:  
Would $4,000 be enough to live a simple life in Vietnam for six months? I don’t care about the quality of the apartment as long as I have good internet.",80,0.75,178,2025-04-08 15:45:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1jugrn7/can_i_live_in_vietnam_for_6_months_on_4000/,yaji12

VietNam,1jlmxzj,Just amazed and want to share,"Only in Vietnam

I had visited a cafe the day before and as we were walking home last eveniong I saw that they had made some freshly baked cakes. It would be nice for my coffee so went in a bought one. When I had to pay, I only had much less or a much bigger bill. The smallest one that would cover the price was 200,000 and the young girl in there could not find the 100,000 in change.

I offered to let the 200,000 be there and I could return today for the change. But she refused to accept that, and she thought it was better if I would come back today and pay. 

I will go back as soon as they open to pay my debt, but where in the world would this happen other than here in Vietnam?

VietNam,1jkbn33,"""I'll think about it"" - VN girls way of rejecting","Something that I learnt recently is that Vietnamese girls reject guys by saying somewhat indirectly ""I'll think about it"" and I thought I'd share this with you guys because it's something I learnt recently and thought was interesting  

Context:

* Australian-born Vietnamese based in Melbourne, Australia. 
* I've experienced rejection from girls from a variety of ethnicities in Australia, so I'm no stranger to rejection.
* However, I'm used to phrases like: ""Sorry, I'm not interested"", ""Sorry, I have a boyfriend"" or ""Let's be friends"". I think Australians are a little more direct about it.
* Over the past ~2 years, I've asked 3 VN girls out for coffee or to hang out some time and the response has interestingly been the same ""I'll think about it""
* Initially, I was happy with the response because it seemed like it's a ""maybe"" and that she might get back to me at a later stage, but after asking out 2/3 of the girls a 2nd time a month or two later, I was met with the same response ""I'll think about it"".
* After asking around, it seems like this is their polite way of saying ""no"" that I was quite unfamiliar with as I was born in Australia.
* Thought I'd share this with any expats, Westernised-Vietnamese people or just people in general that plan on asking a Vietnamese person out in this subreddit! :)",77,0.78,98,2025-03-26 13:21:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1jkbn33/ill_think_about_it_vn_girls_way_of_rejecting/,VietQuads

That remark enraged quite a lot of Vietnamese, and she's been cancelled like all hell.

But then the vitriol spilt over into the Facebook page of SCTV—the Indonesian channel.

VietNam,1jn1im1,"I’m Viet kieu, any advice on how to handle criticism from my relatives?","I love Vietnam a lot and genuinely care for my relatives, but, unfortunately, whenever I visit I always get criticised a lot, and it takes a huge toll on my mental health. I’m in my late 20s, unmarried and I have tattoos. I usually visit my relatives in Vietnam every 5 years and I have a trip coming up this year.

My cousins are pretty chill and they don’t care, but it’s usually my aunties/uncles and my grandma who like to comment on my weight, my tattoos, my acne and so on. They would say that I have health problems because I don’t eat on purpose to stay skinny (which is not true, I’ve always been small, but I love viet food and I make sure to eat as much as I can), they say that I’m stupid and that’s why I get scammed, they say that I look awful because of my tattoos and acne. They constantly comment on my marital status, they try to get as much information about my relationship as possible and then tell me that’s it’s a disgrace to our family that I date a white guy. To be fair, they never criticise my clothes (because I make sure to dress appropriately), but it’s still really hard for me.

Sometimes I try to defend myself (which I do politely of course, I’m never rude to my relatives) and they get offended and tell me that if I respected Vietnamese culture, I wouldn’t have talked back when they’re teaching me. When I don’t have the emotional capacity to respond, I just sit there and listen and then go quietly cry somewhere in the bathroom.

My parents tell me to just be patient, but it’s really hard to ignore when I get criticised almost on a daily basis for what seems to be really trivial things about me that don’t hurt or offend anyone. 

It’s really difficult because family means a lot for me, especially because they are my ties to Vietnamese culture, so it’s important for me to maintain a good relationship with my relatives. I just want to know what to do to make things easier between us. I hope fellow viet people here can offer some advice so that I can prepare for my upcoming trip.

VietNam,1jke6wn,Here's what I love about the country after 3 months,"I've spent the last ~3 months traveling through Vietnam as a digital nomad.

Hanoi -> Ta Van -> Quy Nhon -> Dalat -> HCMC

I've stayed at each place for 2-3 weeks. Had a phenomenal time overall.

To be clear: I don't come from a rich country. I'm from India so I don't find Vietnam to be cheap. The cost is the same as back home. Maybe a bit more expensive here because I know how to get good deals back home.

That said, here's what I love:

1. Amazing food. Fresh vegetables and suitable spice for my Indian palate
2. Probably the best coffee in the world. The variety and nuance of the different coffee from north to south is insane
3. Beautiful nature. A lot of it well maintained 
4. Good roads: this might come as a shocker but I've seen much worse roads
5. I only lived in non touristy areas. All the locals were always friendly and no one tried to scam me
6. Active people. I saw middle aged men and women indulging in football, volleyball, yoga, dance almost everywhere.

Here's what I think needs improvement. Both of these problems are seen in my country as well. This is not a comparison or derogatory post:

1. A lot of plastic use in daily life. I hope this is getting disposed properly by the government
2. The air pollution. The government needs to work on the air pollution as health care will only get more burdensome if the pollution continues


TLDR; love the country. Would love to come back sometime in the future. ",69,0.94,16,2025-03-26 15:16:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1jke6wn/heres_what_i_love_about_the_country_after_3_months/,fittheframe
