1jvzk0p,reddit,My wife thinks video games are juvenile and playing them makes me less attractive.,"42M here. I've been playing video games all my life, in many different genres, from Civilization to Warcraft to Wolfenstein 3D to Halo to Half Life to Fallout to Fornite to Red Dead Redemption to The Witcher to Cyberpunk 2077 and many in between. My wife knew this shortly after we met and of course when we got married. She had always said that she doesn't ""get them"" or understand why anyone would want to play them but she understood that it was something I found relaxing and enjoyable.

Fast forward to this week and she flat out tells me (while we were arguing about something else) that she thinks video games are juvenile, she can't believe that a 42 year old man plays them, and that playing them makes me less attractive to her. For reference, I'm a manager at work, we have a nice house, four kids and 2 dogs. So it's not like I'm just bumming around. And I take care of my hygiene and appearance  - basically I don't fall into any of the negative gamer stereotypes. I also play when everyone else is asleep so it's not cutting into family or housework time. It does mean that I tend to sleep in on weekend mornings though, which she doesn't like, as she's more of a morning person.

Does anyone have any good advice here? Is there any hope of her changing how she feels? She knows that some of them are very much not for kids and that it's a bigger industry than movies, but it doesn't change how she feels. Should I give up gaming? That would feel like a huge sacrifice but would probably have big benefits. Or do we just live with this?

What to do... 

Edit: RIP my inbox.

Edit2: Holy crap. I really tried to keep up, but there have been 14 thousand comments in 14 hours. I might check a few more but there's no way I can read them all. Thankyou for those that added insightful, challenging comments. Thanks less to those who proposed divorce or assumed I was lying. Yes, there are likely underlying issues for both of us, and we need to work on our communication. Yes, r/gaming is biased and perhaps a strange place to post, but it's been worthwhile. Thanks. 

For reference: Our kids are 11, 13, 15 & 16. When I get up at 10am, they are either still asleep, gaming, or YouTubing. I start playing on Friday and Saturday nights (if we're not going out) once jobs are done and kids are in bed, which is usually between 10pm and 12am. I finish between 2 and 3am.

Let me solo her inspired me to help other players as a “Jarnished” summon,
So I put on the jar helm, took off my armour and haven’t stopped helping others since. 😊

I never expected this to come so far, but I just truly enjoyed helping each and every single person, and I always pushed myself to be better; not for me, but for them.

I encountered so many incredible people along the way and found that the elden ring and fromsoft community is really one of a kind. Their appreciation; kindness and support kept me going all this time

So I just want to say thankyou to everyone, truly. It has been such an honour being a part of so many peoples journeys.

It means so much to me.

1jpucx4,reddit,Please people just be smart for ONCE and don't let Nintendo ruin the entire industry by buying a damn digital game for 80 DOLLARS,"I swear to god, if you all do this say hello to the mythical $100 price for GTA6. And you'll deserve that pain for backing up this kind of BS from Nintendo. Cause if they pull it off, others will follow.

*edit:* for the love of god, get a better damn cope than ""inflation"" 

a game will sell well if it's a good game, and the devs / publishers will get their investment back and more in no time if it's good to the people who buy. A great example since you all wanna talk expensive shit, RDR2 estimated budget including marketing was around $550 million, they got a profit of over $700 million **in the first 3 days of launch**, like I said, if a game is good, and it's good to it's players *even with the price*, it will be successful. I can't honestly believe you're all backing up the company that dicks over their own fanbases for the most insane reasons, and it's now at the edge of changing the industry for the worse. I get that Nintendo does good and talented stuff, there's no doubt about that, but this change they are pushing will only give you shit AAA games **from other companies** at worse prices if you let them get away with this.

1jtlku6,reddit,Unpopular opinion: I miss when games let you be a little lost.,"Some of y’all never had to wander around for 45 minutes because the game told you to “go north” and gave you zero map, and it shows.

I just replayed *Morrowind* for the first time in years, and forgot how little hand-holding it gave you. No quest markers, no arrows — just vibes and vague directions from a sketchy NPC. I was mad at first… but also? It kinda hit different. It made me *pay attention* in a way most modern games don’t.

Now everything’s like “Go here. Follow the glowing footprints. Watch the cutscene. Press X to win.”

1k1nrmi,reddit,I'm completely Burnt Out of time sensitive Battle Passes.,"Im so tired of being slaved by battle passes needing to play most games daily just to get my money's worth. This is such a shitty system to force people to play the game.

What BPs Im completing currently?

\- Valorant: The shittiest fucking BP ever that Im forced to buy for radianite. Can take well over 1 hour daily to do the Daily mission. It usually leaves me so burned out that I tend to take a break from the game after I finish a Bp.

\- TFT: decent BP, no daily bs, only weekly and seasonal that you can complete as you play. No complain tbh.

\- Fortnite: plenty of time, 0 thinking and you can afk farm with exp maps easily. The golden standard for bp.

\- Frag Punk last month that thankfully I only needed to play 2 games to complete daily.

My point is: Fuck you valorant and fuck time sensitive battle passes. I enjoy the value battle passes bring but I think we are due to buy the bp once and being yours forever until you complete it.

If I ""have"" to play your game even if Im not feeling like it, Im gonna start hating your game.

1jo7swh,reddit,The seasons changing in Shadows is a great RPG mechanic,"Game: Assassin's Creed: Shadows 

I spent about 50 hrs visiting all the viewpoints before starting the MQ in Shadows and it took about 2 in-game years.

I've never thought, ""I've come a long way in a couple of years"" in an RPG before and I think it'd be a stellar mechanic to adopt in other titles.

It's not a perfect system - you can manually set the season forward or it'll automatically change with fast travel, but it gave a unique sense of depth to those first 50 hours. 

I wasn't expecting this mechanic to give weight to the passage of time but it  felt like Naoe was more *seasoned* after I was done traveling to every viewpoint. 

Would love to see the seasons change in a more traditional sword and sorcery RPG setting.

1jv0frk,reddit,"'There is no lawsuit' against Schedule I: As negative Steam reviews pile up, Drug Dealer Simulator publisher makes a public plea for peace","Dear Gamers,
We’d like to address your Schedule I / Drug Dealer Simulator publication and share some facts regarding the situation.

1. There is no lawsuit. 2. It is not our intention to prevent TVGS from selling or developing their game. 3. There is an investigation into the nature of similarities between the games since a preliminary legal analysis indicated there might have been an infringement. 4. The analysis and investigation were necessary in the light of repeating opinions that the games are very similar. By not investigating it, Movie Games, being a publicly traded company, could face severe consequences for negligence. 5. The above was communicated only via ESPI, a stock market communication system, where we are obligated to publish such information for full transparency. Not publishing it would also be a case of negligence. From there it was picked up by the media and, in some cases, wrongly reported as a lawsuit. 6. The above is handled only by Movie Games, the publisher, not Byterunners, the developer of Drug Dealer Simulator. The developer is not involved in it whatsoever.

There is no ill will towards TVGS. We even mailed them best wishes shortly before the release, when the game was already huge, but before the investigation was deemed necessary. However, we are obligated to perform this investigation, act accordingly to the scope of the infringement if it is confirmed, and inform the public about it via ESPI.
Best wishes, Movie Games",2025-04-09 07:58:16,gaming,gaming,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,7299,502,,0.96,https://www.pcgamer.com/games/there-is-no-lawsuit-against-schedule-i-as-negative-steam-reviews-pile-up-drug-dealer-simulator-publisher-makes-a-public-plea-for-peace/,Busy-Reality-1580

No thanks, I’ll stick to my steel spear made by the local blacksmith. And if I’m feeling extra fancy, maybe I’ll enchant it.

Also, kinda related, but I think guns in shooter games usually look cooler without paint or huge attachments. I’d take a good ol’ plain black shotgun over a machine gun covered in gold and anime girl stickers any day.

1jshwxx,reddit,Did we really have unlimited free time for gaming as a kid or are we just more aware now of our limited free time as adults?,"It seems like back then we weren't really concerned about our free time because many of us who grew up with gaming just have this childhood life cycle of eat, sleep and play with no real concept of time and priorities that's why it felt like we had unlimited amount of free time to play video games.

In reality, it feels mostly just the same.. No way we were getting past 9pm or 10pm curfew as kids without getting scolded so we probably had at max 5-10 hours of free gaming time per day.

Now that we're adults, when trudging through our 9 to 5, eight hour shifts and everything at home settles down after the chores are done, we mostly have about 5 hours of free gaming time as well albeit having some distractions every once in a while

So it's like back then we never really thought about our limited time to play games and just lived in the moment so it felt limitless but now we are more conscious and aware of our time  that we feel the clock tick every minute and it feels like there's never enough free gaming time to play games.",2025-04-06 00:32:52,gaming,gaming,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,4136,494,,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1jshwxx/did_we_really_have_unlimited_free_time_for_gaming/,Dotaspasm

1joeflb,reddit,What's a game that's somewhat easy to 100%/Platinum... except for that ONE trophy,"my mind immediately goes to Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus.

for the other trophies, it's just, ""Oh, play the game, collect these things, do this stuff, and you're good to go."" You can replay missions and get whatever you missed, even being able to keep all your cool stuff when you do so. Fun times all around.

and then there's Mein Leben. Same difficulty as the previous one, I Am Death Incarnate!, except you only have one life and you have to beat the game in one sitting. No saves.

This trophy feels like I'm receiving testicular torsion straight from Satan himself, and the Doom Slayer isn't around to help. This shit requires you to replay the game on IADI! multiple times, but it will never be enough. This shit makes me want to learn coding to develop a way to mod my PS5 and give myself cheats. This shit is the only obstacle between me wanting to platinum my entire\* library and just not doing it. Whoever designed this difficulty hates you, your family, your children, your ancestors, your descendants, your dogs, your cats, and everything you interact with.

1jvh26x,reddit,My 75 year old father has almost finished Red Dead Redemption 1: Still can't believe it,"**A quick recap of how this came to be:** My brother and I separately finished both Red Dead Redemption games. (I finished the second one as recently as last year, and belong to the perhaps 10% of people that believe the 1st is the best. But that both belong together as being, in unison, one of the top 10 of all time, certainly of my lifetime. The first one alone is 'perfect' which I find so rare a label to give a game personally)

My father, as you may guess from his age, grew up when the wild west, westerns were all the rage. He took us to Arizona, to Tucson, to Tombstone, to see heartland of Wyatt Earp, Doc Holiday, Wildbill Hickock and recounted all the stories he knew about them. Long before many people had heard 'Big Iron' through New Vegas, he had it playing in the car on that trip as part of a CD playlist.

Flash forward to last year: I bought the game when it came out on PC (finally), my brother got him his first controller, (I stopped him from attempting to play with keyboard and mouse).

Off he went. As of today, it seems this was the right decision. I knew when I first played it that this was the game for him, and now it's proven 100%.

Not a given: Although I did get him to previously play the Mass Effect Trilogy, which he loved, I was not successful with some others: XCOM, Imperator, Mafia 2, Crusader Kings 2, DA: Origins, all unsuccessfully. They never stuck. He tried them, then just gave up and did something else.

This one however, I wanted to make damn sure he tried, even if he had to struggle with the controller. Set up whatsapp and Steam Broadcast to help when necessary.

Next thing I knew he started doing the next mission, then bounty missions... I saw him in a few combat encounters which he got through....

I had to prod him to use dead eye more often, and use the movement and camera sticks in unison for more fluid play, but it hardly matters. He got on fine and went from mission to mission with great interest (a lot of this stuff I think is obvious for those who grew up with GTA and other similar 3rd person action titles)

**His experience starting up:**

Some initial issues: I set auto-aim to normal which helped, he still had to explore getting used to the twin sticks, and the multitude of buttons. I had to explain to him via a videocall where the triggers where and how they work with aiming and firing.  Biggest issues he had was understanding how cover-based shooting works, initially he'd constantly use the crouch button which was wrong.

But eventually, I could just see him play on his own... past New Austin, past Mexico .... and now he's past the final gang member (>!Dutch!<) nearing the end of the game (though of course he has no idea).

**Some questions on what he thought:**

\-I checked whether he was following the story, and he definitely could recount all the names, the Van der Linde gang, Javier Escuela and Bill Williamson, Bonnie, Seth... everything.

\-Got more or less the impressions I got of the characters.

\-I think he was impressed as anyone else about the Mexico part of the game.

\-He asked what the undead nightmare mode is: I told him to play it once the main game is over. I still have no clue how to explain to him what it is. 'How will I know when the main story is finished' 'You'll know'.

\-Spoiler (leave uncovered if you have not played RDR1) I think that >!once the main story concludes and the shock comes, I'll tell him that the last part could have gone differently if he had used dead eye properly!<... or not

\-At this point I think it's all but certain that he loves the game, more than I could have hoped for, but I knew he would. Now sort of wondering, if, as I expect, he wants to play RDR2, how to best do that. His computer was good enough for RDR1, but the sequel is a whole different ballgame.

Best of all, I've refused to tell him anything about RDR2, except that most people disagree with me and think it's not only better than the first, but among the greatest of all time.

Whatever happens, I am happy I got him to play this. It was an intention I had for years and knew immediately when the PC version dropped.

I think however, apart from the personal story I've shared above, it definitely is a case in point that it really isn't ever too late to learn how to play a relatively modern game even with a controller one has never used. There is a certain amount of logic and intuition that can include most people with little prior experience.",2025-04-09 21:17:08,gaming,gaming,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,1198,155,,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1jvh26x/my_75_year_old_father_has_almost_finished_red/,SlightWerewolf4428

1jngqz9,reddit,What games have you played that had overly aggressive rubber banding or anti-winning mechanics?,"Do you have any personal examples of games that actively prevented you from winning too hard, and you felt that it negatively impacted the overall experience? Racing games and kart racers are notorious for doing this, but I've heard that Oblivion had enemies very obviously leveling up as you progressed through the game (edit: I've read the comments, this wasn't an issue apparently), and Fifa games had boosted odds of scoring when someone was losing.

For me, Mario Kart SC's 2nd place CPU had an extreme speed boost when you got too far ahead, and this was very obvious because the game had powerful shortcuts that allowed you to gain a lot of distance quickly, and right after you did that, the 2nd place CPU instantly doubled their speed and you saw him zooming in the minimap.

1jqgf7e,reddit,All these price hikes are not ever going to reach the developers. Development is already being actively outsourced to lower cost regions and 3rd party outfits.,"I just thought it was worth reminding everyone of this. I know there is a lot of discussion right now about GTA6, the Nintendo Switch 2, the prices of skins in games like League of Legends, etc. There's a whole lot of discussion about how these prices are absurd, are going to alienate the playerbase, etc.

Something that really isn't being given proper attention is that **the justification for why these price hikes need to happen are directly in contrast to the reality of the gaming industry**.

Just in the past week, I've seen memes pointing out how ""*games haven't kept their pricing in line with inflation""*, while failing to account that many games now include a base price, microtransactions, season passes, DLC packs, etc. We recently had the head of *Saber Interactive* go on the record, bragging about how their strategy is to ""*cut costs*"" and outsource development to emergent regions as a means of bolstering profits. You can read more about it here:( [https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-reboot-developer-didnt-know-what-they-were-building-saber-ceo-says-criticising-shuttered-team](https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-reboot-developer-didnt-know-what-they-were-building-saber-ceo-says-criticising-shuttered-team) )We've certainly heard the trope of Phillipe Tremblay of Ubisoft and the whole ""*Gamers need to get used to not owning games.*"" and whatnot. And even though he is no longer there, I think everyone recalls when John Riccitiello of Unity had once suggested charging gamers for the ability to reload their weapons. We're now even hearing about how ""*GTA6 is going to kill a lot of studios and publishers""* making the rounds

What seems to be slipping under the radar is that, despite posting record profits, developers have been getting laid off for nearly 2 years now. It was attributed to the ""*COVID hangover*"" at first, then it came down to ""*inflated development costs*"", now we're circling back to ""*games haven't kept up with inflation""*, and I expect (undoubtedly) that we'll soon see the newly-minted tariffs as a reason why the business needs to raise prices. There doesn't seem to be **any** discussion about the job losses that *already* took place. There doesn't seem to be any discussion about how the very same companies crying foul about development costs ***have already moved their operations overseas*** as a means of cutting costs.

These price hikes have nothing to do with the business being unsustainable, and everything to do with corporate greed. Companies don't get to outsource their operations to Poland, Brasil, China, Vietnam, Turkey, the Phillipines, and outsource providers **and also** complain that they aren't making enough money. These same companies are actively trying to cut headcounts and incorporate tools that replace even more humans, such as Activision starting to include generative AI to build assets, or using deceptive contract language to replace voice actors with AI generated lines. Whole divisions of game development have been outsourced to 3rd party providers, who pocket anywhere between 20-60% of the contract's value while underpaying contractors who don't have any benefits or protections; companies like *Keywords* and *Pole to Win* now, almost assuredly, do the majority of testing for your games. They charge the biggest players in the field full price salaries, while subcontracting the work to people for $10/hr. When developers tried to unionize, they were already being let go. Unionization efforts are effectively failing across the industry.

If these proposed price hikes went to ensuring development teams were being maintained, staying together, promoting longevity and sequels and the opportunity to create more new titles, I think gamers would consider it more tolerable; but that isn't happening. Studios are cutting costs, firing staff, and paying out even bigger bonuses to a handful of C-suite members. **C-Suite staff do not make video games**. People like Matt Karch, a person wealthy enough to own a private jet, are doing press tours telling everyone how expensive game development is while his company pays people a fraction of what they would have earned 5 years ago. These price hikes aren't going to ensure that developers and studios can build new titles freely; they're going to ensure that the financial class which has actively been ruining this industry for a decade gets to reap even bigger rewards off the backs of consumers. All while they whimper and whine about how difficult, how expensive, how unsustainable game development has become.

EDIT:I thought I would add this, after commenting it in response to another user's reply.

Keep in mind that many developers **are already:**

* using a pre-existing Engine to expedite game development
* using AI to generate assets (art, audio, V/O, missions/narrative design)
* using outsourced shops to control quality and handle player support issues
* using volunteers to moderate social media/manage communities
* using content creators for marketing/pushing product sales
* in a specific instance, using players to create free content for the game, as noted in the case of *Minecraft, Roblox, and Fortnite Creative/UEFN* where modders work for free and the parent company takes a share of any profits generated",2025-04-03 11:54:23,gaming,gaming,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,1064,223,,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1jqgf7e/all_these_price_hikes_are_not_ever_going_to_reach/,CyberSmith31337

1k5wxp7,reddit,Opinion: Xbox Gamepass in 2025 is absolutely incredible and it's finally showing the full potential,"I feel like this is probably the best year ever for the service, and we are only in the first half. 

It also couldnt have happened in a best time: gaming prices are going up. Games are going up, services are going up, consoles are going up. Buyng a game has become an investiment, something you have to really think about before actually doing it. 

For the situation im currently in i know that i cant affrd to buy Oblivion, South of Midnight and Doom DA next month. Especially since i have to save money for the Switch 2. Granted i can wait for a deal, but that's the beauty of it: i dont have to.

Having something like Gamepass in this days is a life saver. And i think that while the growth might have slowed down in the last couple of year, with how gaming is becoming more and more expensive, Gamepass can become a big part of the market.

(Please dont immediatly go with ""this sound like an ad"" just because im positive lol)

Warhammer Total War III: Deep strategy game with a huge range of available factions and units, great design, but the real-time battles just felt too chaotic for me and like I didn't have enough control over my units - being ultimately unsatisfying.

1jzsyhe,reddit,What games would you recommend for a grandpa who can't move for 8 months?,"My 72 year old father hurt his foot and he's in for a long recovery, about 8 months. He lives with my mother and while I try to get over there as much as I can to bring some positivity, it's usually only once or twice a week and means long stretches of time where he can't escape the most negative, patronizing person I've ever met (I love and respect my mother, but you gotta call a spade a spade). I have an Xbox Series X that I hardly use because I mostly PC game (and the kids are too young for it) so I wanted to set it up for him to hopefully give him that escape and let him interact with the outside world and engage the problem solving portion of his brain so he's not just withering away. 

What I'm looking for is a good game or couple games that will be good for someone who  
1) hasn't played a video game since the Pac-Man arcade box  
2) can occasionally get easily frustrated  
3) would really benefit from a positive online community

I have Xbox Game Pass so that whole library is available, but I have no problem buying something that fits the bill for what I'm looking for. I feel like something like Animal Crossing on Switch might be perfect, but since this only has a 30% chance of working, I'm not willing to spend a few hundred dollars on a console I don't have, so Xbox recommendations only.

1jlugs6,reddit,I wish the open world in AC games felt less like an open air museum,"So after having played Shadows for a week now, I have to say that my initial excitement has died down a fair bit and I already start feeling a bit burned out. As with Origins and Odyssey, they once again crafted an absolutely stunning open world with a ton of detail. But just as with these games, it feels more like am walking around a theme park without actually interacting with it. 
The function to get some historical context every now and then is great in theory but doesn't help the feeling like I am in a museum. When discovering a new town, I can talk to maybe 3 people and one or two merchants. Oh, and pet dogs. 

A big issue for me is also how very little unique some important places work as part of the level design. Osaka castle should historically speaking be a super important landmark in the game. Yet I can just walk in there within the first couple of hours and kill everyone without having to worry too much about the layout of the castle etc. And the process of infiltrating castles stays the exact same for every single one of them. Except for nice vistas, the rewards for exploration are also quite negligible since equipment gets outscaled so quickly.

I just wish they would include at least a little bit more immersion. I don't expect KC2, but just some elements to make the world feel alive. At least that would help me not feeling burned out by the game after such a short while.",2025-03-28 12:58:42,gaming,gaming,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,667,317,,0.79,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1jlugs6/i_wish_the_open_world_in_ac_games_felt_less_like/,SapporoBiru

I’ve broken controllers in rage, laughed with friends on voice chat, and stayed up way too late grinding levels. But I never really *felt* anything deeper than that… until last night.

I finished *Spiritfarer*. I won’t spoil anything, but there’s this moment — if you’ve played it, you know the one — where the game doesn’t just *end*, it *lets go* of you. And something about how it handled loss, love, and closure completely hit me in a way no game ever has.

I sat there staring at the credits and just cried. Not like sobbing, but the kind of quiet tears you get when something reaches way further into your chest than you expected. It was beautiful.

Gaming used to be just an escape for me. But last night it reminded me that games can also be a place to *process*. A space where you sit with things. And I’m kind of grateful for that.

1jo93iv,reddit,Hot Take: I personally love knowledge checks in videos games,"I’ve noticed that between a lot of gaming community and friends that knowledge checks are something that most people do not enjoy. 

However, I personally have always loved knowledge checks in a lot of video games I’ve played, such as many Soulborne games, LoL, various fighting games. Pokemon, heck.. even Clash Royale.

To me, there is just something so fun about experiencing a crazy interaction and learning about it for future matches or playthrough. I understand that a lot of people don’t like mechanics that are not mentioned explicitly and consider it unfair, but I do personally find it skillful to be able to lose to a specific interaction or knowledge check and to be able to learn and be aware of it for future gameplay. 

I am not saying that games be riddled with knowledge checks, but I do think there is a bit of magic and depth added to a game when there are just niche interactions and mechanics that aren’t explained to you and something you have to learn on your own.",2025-03-31 17:39:56,gaming,gaming,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,358,163,,0.71,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1jo93iv/hot_take_i_personally_love_knowledge_checks_in/,0verlimit
1jyq76v,reddit,All I want is a modern Star Trek or Star Wars MMORPG that isn't stuck in 2012. Is that too much to ask?,"I've been rewatching Star Trek: Picard after binging Lower Decks and Strange New Worlds, and revisiting bits of TNG, DS9, Voyager, you name it. Like a lot of fans, I ended up back in Star Trek Online (yes, I even bought the lifetime subscription way back when), and while it scratches a nostalgic itch, it's honestly so outdated and overwhelming now. It feels like trying to patch a Holodeck program on Windows XP.

And here's the thing. How has no one truly capitalized on this universe?

Star Trek has infinite content potential. Exploration, diplomacy, ethics, politics, war, weird science, personal growth, interspecies dynamics. Yet in gaming, we mostly get clunky MMOs and mobile cash grabs.

The same goes for Star Wars: The Old Republic. Massive lore, beloved characters, a hungry fanbase. And still no truly groundbreaking modern MMORPG or single-player RPG?

Imagine a Star Trek MMORPG that starts you at Starfleet Academy. You choose your path. Command, Science, Engineering. The game evolves with you. You make moral decisions, negotiate with Klingons, explore anomalies that defy the laws of physics, or dive deep into espionage with the Romulan Free State. It could be built on a sleek modern engine, with real world-building and character depth. 

Give us Mass Effect in the Federation, and I would never touch grass again.

So why has no one built this? Is it licensing? Fear of the scale? Or do they just not understand how many of us would throw money at our screens for something this immersive?

1jphpku,reddit,Atomfall feels like a half baked game.,"I've enjoyed my time playing Atomfall, but it never pulled me in like say, Fallout does. There's a lot of reasons why I think this is, some are personal to me I'm sure, but some I think are more general critiques of the game.

First, I find the lack of fast travel a huge negative. I know none of the maps are that large. But having to take the same route from Interchange to Wyndham, past the same 6 Outlaws for fifth time isn't fun. It doesn't help that killing them is just a waste of ammo since an encounter with them always net negative. This feels intentional to discourage combat, but when my options are combat and get to where I'm going or spend three to five minutes avoiding combat every time, it's not longer fun avoiding combat all the game.

On the subject of combat... Stealth absolutely sucks. It's so hit and miss I don't really bother with it. The number of times there's no indicator someone can see me but they're already aggressive is too much. I always favor stealth in games, but in Atomfall I've completely given up on using it. Even when you do get a stealth takedown. It seems to broadcast a signal five rooms over to let all the other enemies know you're there. (I know a skill reduces this noise, but still.)

Finally, let's talk about melee. It sucks. It's just a spammy, terrible system. There's no blocking, so I guess you're supposed to use your kick to make distance, but then you have to close distance to do damage. All in all, it feels like using the crowbar in Half Life. Spam hits and hope it works. This becomes even worse when you're fighting the infected who are boring to fight with melee but also sponge bullets like no tomorrow.

Probably my other biggest complaint is the fact basically everyone is aggressive everywhere. Outside of Wyndham, anywhere you go is enemies only. Plot is given for some of this, but most of it just feels like an excuse to keep you on your toes or to make you take exaggerated and long routes to get anywhere. This isn't helped by the fact you slide off any slightly angled surface which really feels like it punishes exploration.

All in all, a 6 out 10 game for me. It feels like a game that needs another 30% added to it to really feel like a full game. Many reviewers point out that it feels like an old game, and perhaps that's true. But there's many older games that are more engaging and more fun. Heck, compare it to Fallout 3 even. I think there's a lot of potential in Atomfall. But it doesn't feel realized.

1jw1anr,reddit,What’s your weapon of choice when playing a game?,"FUCKING DAGGERS, idc if it’s a shitty tool, idc if it’s absolutely broken I will always go the way of stealth and daggers are usually the way for it. I played the first half of Elden Ring just going behind people for a 50% health check or kill and that was with a dagger once I was able to get it. 

Dual wielding is another, doesn’t matter if it’s a sword or a damn pistol I am always going to pick up two of the same weapon type to get that sweet satisfying kill with two instead of one. 

Also, I don’t care if it makes the game easier or I lose an attachment slot for it. The silencer is my go to for anything. Sniper and handcanons are a close second, it’s the damn thrill of it. You telling me when you’re shooting a pistol like 007 you aren’t a fucking gangster? Absolutely hands down more fun but less viable depending on how you use it / if the game rewards it.

I had played Final Fantasy games before, so I knew I liked the series. When my mom took me for our weekly Friday Blockbuster outing, I saw Tactics for the first time and picked it up. I had never played a game like it and I was enamored. I barely made a dent in the story by the time I had to return it, so I asked my mom if we could buy it. We couldn’t find it anywhere. So for something like 2 months, every Friday I’d return FFT and immediately re-rent it, before we finally found a copy. It’s my favorite game of all time and I’ve beaten it several times since then. 

Was there a game you re-rented over and over?

Tell me about the games you know were total dog shit, everyone rated poorly, including YOU but for some reason, you still somehow, someway enjoyed them.

I'll confess first.

My gaming sin is Redfall.

That game is buggy, framerate drops galore and normally I don't give a shit so if I give a shit, its REAL REAL bad. The AI for that game is more A than I and crashes. Oh god the Crashes.

But man... playing as a cryptid hunter as Devinder and using the Stake launcher, killing things, just hit all the right buttons in my brain.

Heavy weapons go brrrrr.

I still wrote a scathing review about that game on the Steam page. I stated that I liked playing the game but I couldn't in good conscience EVER recommend the game to another person because of above issues. I believe I rated it 4-5/10. ASS. 

I actually got a Bethesda support staff to respond asking if there was anything they could do to fix it and I told em, its not your problem to solve, its managements and there's no way in hell they can salvage this game. And I was right.

1jvlpgc,reddit,New York in Division franchise is probably my favorite setting in any video game.,"The entire point of this post is just how realistic the world looks like. You can absolutely imagine that the situation the World of Division is facing is real (massive civil unrest after an extremely dead virus made in a lab got released).

In the first game you have almost war-torn snowy Midtown NYC in Christmas decorations and in Division 2 DLC Warlords of New York you have the same war-torn Lower Manhattan just weeks after one of the worst hurricanes in human history to the point that it tore through Brooklyn bridge and beached an oil tanker. Also the game has LOTS of loot crates and crafting materials suitcases hidden in the world so exploring is really worthwhile. Almost every side alley is fully explorable, sometimes you'll find yellow switches that will unlock the buildings with even more shit to loot. 

I'm not even from USA nor have ever visited. I'm currently playing Division 2 and for the last couple of months it has been my most played game. I put some 100 hrs in Division 1 but that was in 2022 way past it's prime.

I recently saw Rebel Galaxy Outlaw on sale for like $4 in the PlayStation store and it looked interesting, so I bought it. While I'm not very far in the main story, it's definitely not just a spiritual successor to Privateer, it clearly has been influenced by it. Examples: 

* You start with a junk freighter that barely can do anything, and have to work your way up to buying better do you can pieces the game. 
* There's a space patrol that will randomly check you for contraband (which you can either buy in shadier space ports or pick up from blasting pirates. If they find anything, you have to fight them or flee.
* You can gain reputation with various factions, which can negatively affect your reputation with opposing factions. 
* Some of The random enemies you encounter seen to be religious zealots, a la the Church of Man in Privateer.
* There's mission boards your can get missions from to earn more credits. There's also both merchant's and mercenarie's guilds you can pay to join and get better missions from. 
* One of the companies you can get missions from is Lynch Industries, which is the same name as a major player in Privateer.
* The name of many of the weapons is the same and in the same order of power, most notably the most powerful gun being the tachyon cannon.

I'm sure there's more that I'll find as I go, but given how much I liked Privateer, I'm really liking this game and I figured I'd let people know in case that also have find memories of Privateer and want to try something similar.

1jm8j0d,reddit,Outer Wilds made me cry for the first time in years (don't read the spoilers!!!!),"I'm not an emotional person, one could call me a walking rock and it wouldn't be far from the truth, the last time I genuinely cried I was a kid (21 now), well, not anymore

I finished the base game last year and it hit me like a truck, it was too much for my ass to handle, and I had emotions flowing like I never had, I didn't cry but it was pretty damn close

One week ago I decided to actually play the DLC as I was holding into it because I don't like horror games,  and my god, what a marvelous piece of art, it did everything I liked about the base game and managed to make me feel things just as well, the extra bit of lore you get is just the Cherry on top of everything it does so well related to game-design, the ending of the DLC actually got some tear drops out of me, I used my old save to keep playing the DLC so I got the ""true"" ending cutscene as I had almost the entire ship-log unlocked, and that hit extra hard because it makes you remember details about the main story (that by itself, gets me sentimental by just thinking about it)

After this, I knew I had one last objective, that is to beat the game again because >!I rightfully guessed the prisoner would be there, just like Solanum!<, but before that I had the idea of getting all the achievements so I could get all the enjoyment out of this game, a couple of days ago I got the remaining two, and in the process of getting the achievements I revisited some spots from the story and that worked as some sort of ""replay"" because even though I already had some achievements unlocked, I always sidetracked here and there just to read some of the dialog and get some of the details scattered around (and also to get the remaining log-entries for the achievement)

When I finally got the >!""Tubular""!< achievement (the only trophy I actually had trouble to get), I >!waited for the loop to end inside the dream world, just roaming around for no reason!<, and went straight to the objective, I still think about how genius the level design is for blocking important stuff with knowledge barriers, to the point you can beat the game in \~10 minutes if you know what to do, and as I started the last journey with my ship everything about the game started popping into my head, and the moment I reached the >!Vessel!< I was already losing my mind, the journey was reaching an end and the >!Owls!< weren't there to stop me, a funny bit of curiosity is that I could see the >!Signal blocker!< those bitches left in >!The Eye!<, it's still floating there like if nothing happened, good thing the >!Nomai outsmarted them!<

If reaching the end for the first time was like getting hit by a truck, this time around it was like a big ass train, having the >!prisoner talk about his sacrifice, and having him realize it was all worth it in the end!< was the last bit of satisfaction I needed

As the credits started rolling I completely lost it, I cried like a little baby and that goddamn song is now a permanent part of my brain, I doubt any other video game will make me cry like I did here, it felt so personal, I'm glad I decided to finish this game for good the way I did, the perfect ending for the perfect game

I know taste is a very personal thing, I've heard opinions about this game that don't make any sense to me, and even though some people just don't have that **spark** of curiosity that it requires, consider giving this game a try",2025-03-28 23:15:10,gaming,gaming,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,115,61,,0.7,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1jm8j0d/outer_wilds_made_me_cry_for_the_first_time_in/,Marc_Vn

1jqmfe3,reddit,The most piratey guide to pirate games that has ever pirated in the history of piracy!,"***Disclaimer: This is about the genre of pirate games! It contains NO instructions regarding illegally obtaining games!***

***Link to the original guide:***

[***https://www.piratesahoy.net/threads/the-most-piratey-guide-to-pirate-games-that-has-ever-pirated-in-the-history-of-piracy.34594/***](https://www.piratesahoy.net/threads/the-most-piratey-guide-to-pirate-games-that-has-ever-pirated-in-the-history-of-piracy.34594/)

*Cover image created by our members and developers Hammie and Nomad. Used with their permission.*

Ahoy there!

We, the ladies and gentlemen of PiratesAhoy!, a community focused on pirate games, have banded together to create a comprehensive guide to games set in the Age of Sail. It was made to raise awareness that the genre is more alive than ever, and to provide a counterpoint to the ""Nobody makes good pirate games anymore""-narrative.

It was planned to post the entire guide right here, but it was too big for reddit, so the reddit-thread will be a very short version. It will still include the entire list, but without any detailed descriptions. If you want to read the whole thing, feel free to pay a visit to our site via the link - it will directly lead you to the guide in question. It's also recommended to save that to your bookmarks, since the reddit-thread won't be updated once it gets archived.

The original starts with quite a lot of rambling regarding the genre itself, so if you want to jump right to the list, just scroll down until you hit the big, bold text, which is also the title of this guide.

For your convenience, and to not make this list explode, it's limited to pirate games where you control a ship (in)directly that is integral to the gameplay instead of being mere fluff. It will also only list games set in the Age of Sail, otherwise, you would have to take tons of sci-fi games too.  
Not included are games that aren't playable in any form as of the time of writing, are abandoned in EA, frankly bad, nobody of us has played (yet), and have PlayWay as a publisher. They are notorious for clogging the stores with concepts, which are then developed depending on wishlists. Suffice it to say, their pirate games will never come to fruition.

If the games have optional multiplayer, are in Early Access, have demos available as of the time of writing, and/or are free to play, I will mark those with (MP), (EA), (D), and (F2P) respectively.

They are divided into categories, depending on whether you look for titles similar to Black Flag, Sea of Thieves, and such, and are all in alphabetical order.

Now, let's go!

1k5tbh8,reddit,Oblivion Remaster WARNING! Steam Cloud might not have your savedata backed up!,"Hello good folks.

I have been enjoying the first couple of hours of the Remaster

BUT

I couldn’t see my Oblivion saves from my PC when I booted up the game on my SteamDeck. Which was weird, cuz Steam says it’s synced with the cloud.

I did some digging.

It seems Oblivion Remaster uses C/Users/Your\_User\_Here/Documents/My Games for its savedata, regardless of what location you have set for the system folder “Documents”

For most people the system folder “Documents” is probably the aforementioned folder in C/Users. However the default “documents” path can be changed (in properties of the “Documents Folder in This PC). My “Documents” is in D/Documents, and all my games uses that folder correctly, as they look for the “Documents” system folder.

But not Oblivion Remaster. The game has created the C/Users/ documents folder again (that I previously deleted), and the only thing in that folder is the SaveData.

Steam however seems to look for the system folder “Documents” in which there aren’t any savedata from Oblivion Remaster and my saves (and yours maybe) may therefore not be backed up.

Hopefully Bethesda can patch this, so the game uses the user defined “Documents” path instead of the default path it has when Windows is installed. Alternatively, tell Steam to cloud sync the correct folder, where the actually saves are.

Make sure to back up your saves!",2025-04-23 07:31:24,gaming,gaming,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,88,20,,0.72,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1k5tbh8/oblivion_remaster_warning_steam_cloud_might_not/,nicouou

The Finals seems like the type of game that should absolutely blow up considering what it offers in the current state of the gaming industry riddled with greed and soulless games. A well-rounded F2P model with lots of free cosmetics, pretty generous free battlepass rewards, plenty of character customization, one of the best emotes and cosmetics I've ever seen in a game, a communicative dev team that actually cares about and listens to the community. Now, from the gameplay side of things it has some of the most satisfying gun play then any shooter game I've played, fluid movement, innovative gameplay (there is quite literally no game like it currently with the original Cashout mode format, dynamic destruction and crazy amounts of strategizing it opens up), a highly vaired meta and different gamemodes to choose from for casual and competitive players. 

I have been playing the game since Season 1 and I will sum up my experience throughout that time. From Season 1, the devs have been constantly figuring out what they want their game to be, balancing it out, figuring out all the small kinks, finding the identity of the game and gotta say, for the majority of that journey, it has been an addictively fun experience. Sure, as any game, it does have some flaws, but as I said previously, it is a game that truly innovated the shooter genre and what I hope shooter games become. Some of the more burning questions regarding the game are:

  
1. **What is the current situation with cheaters?** From my experience, encountering a cheater is very rare and due to how dynamic and unpredictable the game flow is, you can simply focus on sneakily stealing a cashout and ignore the gun fights to win. I'm not saying that you won't encounter them, you will, but personally, they are an insignificant factor when deciding to play the game or not. The anti-cheat is constantly being improved upon aswell.

2. **Server performance and stability, desync** \- This is something the game does struggle at times, but it is also something that is being actively worked on by the dev team, even moreso in this season specifically as a Major 100k Tournament is planned for later this year. Out of 10 games, I would say I get frustrated with server performance in maybe one or two instances (looking at you, dagger players stabbing me in the ""back""), overall the game performs no different if not better in some ways then other games considering how heavy the server load is. Bigger and more detailed maps like Kyoto take the biggest toll on the servers, but even then it's fine in most cases. Every other map runs smoothly from my experience.

3. **Regular updates and feedback** \- I cannot stress enough how communicative and committed Embark is when it comes to their game. They actively listen to feedback and balance the game accordingly and not just balance, fan ideas regarding cosmetics have also been implemented numerous times. They are dedicated to creating a truly fun experience, which is not surprising considering what the devs team background is, truly talented people. I never bought anything in game before The Finals, but this is one live-service game that deserves me spending 10€ on a battlepass that also pays for itself btw so no need to keep buying it.

4. **What is the average casual player experience like?** Take it from somebody that doesn't play shooter games all that religiously (I've played a little bit of Valorant for a short period and that's about it), the game can be extremely sweaty, but contrary to popular belief, I don't think the game is that unfriendly for new players. I've gotten a couple of my friends that are familiar with shooters like CoD to play and they are performing quite fine, they do still have to get used to map layouts and different things all the classes do, but all of that will come through practice just as with any game. It truly becomes a unique gaming experience once you get to know it and that is why I feel in love with the game. 

In short, The Finals is what the shooter genre has been waiting for, an innovative game with satisfying gunplay and movement and best of all - no greed. **What more could you ask for? Give it a try.**",2025-04-03 10:28:06,gaming,gaming,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,86,111,,0.61,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1jqevl6/the_finals_a_game_that_deserves_so_much_more_not/,_B_R_A_N_E_
