It's been a while since I've used any, *and it shows.* But I'm satisfied with my work, and that's what's important. And I'm still learning. I can only go up from here.

Also, the thinner frosting was indeed easier to handle. For those of you who saw my last post just add half the amount of milk as heavy cream to the frosting and it should be a manageable consistency. Instead of ¼ cup of cream, I went with ½ cup of cream and ¼ cup of milk. Although, after taking the frosting out of the fridge, it needed to thin out with more milk. So if you run into that situation, a splash of milk to the frosting is what I suggest to soften it. Best of luck to you all, should you choose to make it too.",109,0.99,6,2025-04-20 04:37:25,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k3eo1l,ObsdianDrknssHelena

A simple but delicious recipe 😋. I missed Soju bar so I had to make it at home 😊.

Ingredients:
Marinate
- Ginger
- Salt and pepper
- Oil
- Mirin (optional)
- Potato starch

Sauce
- I used 1 tbsp. Gochujang depends on how spicy you want it to be. 
- I used 0,5 tbsp. Honey depends on how sweet you want it to be. 
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 1,5 tbsp soy sauce
- 2 to 4 garlic cloves

Garnish (Whatever you have left in the fridge
- Green onions
- Cilantro

Instructions
Marinate your chicken wings or drumsticks 2 hours before with ginger, salt, pepper and oil. (Mirin is optional)

After marinating, coat them with starch (potato or corn works fine).
Shake off the excess starch and fry them 2 times. Once for 3 to 5 min. The second time for 3 min.

Coat it in the sauce and toss it around in a bowl. Top it off with your garnish and there you have it! Your own korean fried chicken 🍗",80,0.98,1,2025-04-02 15:21:12,https://i.redd.it/mkf2mb5mvfse1.jpeg,ViyVY

Tip2 Do not add sugar when you marinate if you are the beginner. Meat marinated with sugar could get burned easily in searing.
