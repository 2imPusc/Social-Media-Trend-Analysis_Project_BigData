So this was the prelude to what I am about..

I am really controlled by moods, depending on my good or bad habits...

My current mood is, and this is the literal representation of my life experience as of late given my habits...

  
The song is: Staind - It's Been a While

It says volumes about me, but what about you? We all need that someone who will help us go on despite being been a while since we can do all we wanted to do!",2025-04-21 20:03:25,music,music,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,36,215,,0.77,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1k4n4hi/one_song_that_represents_you_at_this_moment/,Zaxxibal

1jtlvt5,reddit,Rick Rubin: A Spiritual Guru or a Master Marketer?,"Rick Rubin is often hailed as a kind of mystical creative force, a barefoot oracle of minimalism and intuition, whose hands-off approach to music production is somehow seen as revolutionary. There’s no doubt he’s been involved in some powerful work, and he clearly holds a deep reverence for the creative process. But the more I look at the full picture, the more contradictions I see.

Rubin has a net worth of over $200 million. Yet, his podcast has sponsors. His online community “The Creative Act” is behind a paywall. He still charges enormous fees for production work, which, by his own account  is extremely hands-off. He often dodges questions about the business side of his work by saying things like “let’s talk about the art instead,” or “someone else can handle that.” This might sound poetic at best but at worst it’s evasive or even manipulative.

If Rubin really cared about spreading his creative philosophy, wouldn’t he make it accessible to everyone? Why not remove the paywalls, make the podcast ad-free, mentor emerging artists at affordable rates? With the financial security he has, it seems totally within reach. But instead, his wisdom, however sincere, is repackaged and monetised ruthlessly.

Take the Johnny Cash cover of Hurt. Yeah, Rubin suggested the song. It was a brilliant choice, but also a strategic one. It reintroduced Cash to Gen X and millennial audiences by tapping into a pre-existing emotional current. And while the result was haunting and powerful, it’s hard not to see the marketing logic beneath the poetry. The move wasn’t just emotionally resonant, it was commercially savvy.

Compare that to someone like Steve Albini, who was transparent about finances, kept his rates fair, refused royalties, and worked with both big names and underground artists alike. Albini never cultivated a guru persona, and yet, he arguably embodied more artistic integrity because he owned the economics of his work instead of pretending they didn’t exist.

In the end, I think sincerity and strategy can coexist, but only when there’s transparency. When creators are honest about their dual intentions (to move people and to reach them), we trust them more. When they mystify or obscure their strategy under a cloak of detachment, it starts to feel hollow, even manipulative.

So: Is Rick Rubin a wise man who made money by accident? Or is he a master of branding whose detachment is part of a very strategic performance?

Just to clarify, I don’t deny that Rubin has clear talent and wisdom, I just think he’s quite greedy with it

Rather, I mean albums that are put together in a way that all the tracks flow from one to the next, the themes, moods, ideas, etc presented go together in a way that makes sense, or is cohesive, or are sensible reactions to the rest of the album. Things like that. 

Basically, albums that seem to have been written to be a complete work. And then of those, which do you think are the best of the best?

Side note: they don’t have to be concept albums, but concept albums tend to fit those criteria. 

Some examples of what I’m talking about:

Bruce Springsteen - Born to Run

Deltron 3030 - Deltron 3030

Fleetwood Mac - Rumours

Miles Davis - Birth of the Cool

Hum - You’d Prefer an Astronaut 

And the obvious:

Pink Floyd - The Wall, Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here

A sunflower is known for following the sun during the day, and being at its peak when the sun is present. But the idea of it continuing to grow at night says that even in darkness or challenging times, we can still grow and be positive. 
""Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes"" is like a sense of longing and hope, and waiting for something positive to happen.

1jvigzp,reddit,Rock bands that should be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,"The Smiths - The Smiths are one of the shortest lived yet most popular rock bands of the 1980s. Active for only five years, they are one of the most influential bands. The Smiths had previously been nominated twice in 2015 and 2016 but missed both nominations. The Smiths are one of the pioneers of 1980s alternative/indie rock. 

Motorhead - Motorhead is one of the most popular heavy metal bands of all time. The band had a career lasting exactly 40 years, disbanding just after the death of lead vocalist and bassist Lemmy Kilmister. Several other members had died in the 2010s both before and after Lemmy - co-lead guitarist Wurzel in July 2011, original drummer Phil Taylor in November 2015 (just one month before Lemmy) and original lead guitarist ""Fast"" Eddie Clarke in January 2018 (becoming the last member of the band's classic ""original"" lineup). Motorhead was nominated for induction in 2020 but missed it. 

Iron Maiden - Iron Maiden is one of the most popular heavy metal bands of all time. Iron Maiden is one of the most controversial snubs when it comes to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Iron Maiden missed both nominations, having previously been nominated in both 2021 and 2023. 

Ronnie James Dio - Ronnie James Dio is an icon of heavy metal. He has been the lead vocalist of several big bands including Rainbow, Black Sabbath, Dio (his own solo band) and Heaven & Hell (technically a Black Sabbath reunion). Ronnie James Dio was also not inducted as a member of Black Sabbath during their induction in 2006. Ronnie James Dio died in May 2010 and he would love the honor. 

Motley Crue - Motley Crue is possibly the biggest 1980s hair/glam metal band out there and they have never even been nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band even claims that it's unlikely that they will ever be inducted.

Any Albums by Bob Marley & The Wailers.
My parents were massive fans of his music before I was even born. When I was growing up, I heard his music consistently at home, events, weddings, parties, barbecues. His songs still make me feel peaceful when I hear it. Every album of his has no song that doesn't sound dated. It sounds like it could be released.

I like that 21st century artists like Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Alicia Keys, Lana Del Rey, etc are making albums that are about quality not just quantity. It will make listeners listen to it consistently after hearing for the first time.

1jomcxq,reddit,Why can't we all like different music without being told our taste is bad just because we don't like whatever else does.,"My family likes watching American Idol and I personally do not like it because I very much dislike 90% of the songs they choose. They're just not the kind of songs I want to hear being covered on this show but that's okay the show doesn't have to be for everybody. Now one person in my family in particular can't handle people's opinions that don't align with his own I've noticed and didn't like what I said. 

Saying I have no good taste in music unlike the rest of the family. I mean why do people feel the need to bash others because your taste doesn't align? Also why do some people feel like their opinions are superior to others it's a little ridiculous? I'm willing to agree to disagree and walk away I don't feel like my opinion is superior and then I have to defend it. There's just honestly no point.

 Also this man likes to tell you quite often to use your brains and acts like you're stupid as well as feeling like his opinions are superior and that he's always right you're wrong it's so aggravating. People need to learn that not everyone is going to agree with you all the time.

1jpvjt3,reddit,Musicians Fight Back Against AI with Silent Album and Lawsuits,"The music world is rallying against the use of artificial intelligence in music production. In February 2025, over 1,000 artists, including Kate Bush, Damon Albarn, and Annie Lennox, united for a record protest. They recorded an instrumental album, ""Is This What We Want?,"" a sharp protest against suggested changes to UK copyright law that would allow AI firms greater latitude to use copyrighted music in their own work without consent from artists. Their contention is simple: if artists are being replaced by AI-generated music, music itself in the future may be vulnerable.



This is a figurative protest, but it represents mounting alarm among musicians, composers, and music industry experts about the integration of artificial intelligence into the creative process. They worry most that AI music, which can reproduce human songs by scanning massive collections of previous tunes, can devalue the creativity and artistry that give human music its uniqueness. With AI models now able to clone styles, voices, and even the passion of real-life artists, there are artists that fear having their work reproduced without the rightful recompense or credits. Meanwhile, big recording labels sue.



In June of 2024, Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group filed a case against AI music company Suno and Udio for employing copyright protected music to train their AI in the first instance. These lawsuits pose an even broader legal and ethical issue: should AI be taught using existing music without compensating original creators? Most in the business contend that without strong regulations, AI firms would be able to freely gain financially from artists' efforts while undermining the same business that motivated them. This fight extends beyond the music business—it raises basic questions regarding intellectual property, authorship of creation, and the role of AI in art. Some view AI as an unstoppable force that will define the future of music, creating new frontiers for composition and creativity. Others worry that if left to run amok, human artists will be unable to compete with AI-created material that can be created faster, cheaper, and on a jaw-dropping scale.



With artists, industry stakeholders, and lawmakers now disagreeing about the future of AI and music, the next several months could prove instrumental in shaping how copyright law adapts in the new world.



If AI music should be more tightly controlled, or is it just the next evolution of music? How do musicians get paid when AI are trained on their compositions? While protests continue to surface and lawsuits continue to unravel, one thing is clear—this battle is far from won. Where are we going? Should we throw open the doors to AI as a new creative force, or could it pose an actual threat to musicians and to the industry itself?

1jpuej8,reddit,Women and Children First is the best David Lee Roth era Van Halen album,"While most Van Halen can argue over what is the best David Lee Roth era Van Halen album, it's either Van Halen 1, Fair Warning or 1984, but I think it's 1980s Women and Children First.  It's the raw, unadulterated distillation of their unique energy, capturing the band at their most innovative and arguably, their most daring, showcasing a darker, grittier edge. This album took what made Van Halen 1 and 2 great and added Heavy Metal and Blues influences. This is also the album where Eddie truly began pushing the boundaries of his instrument, incorporating unconventional techniques and textures. Tracks like ""And The Cradle Will Rock..."", ""Everybody Wants Some!!"", ""Romeo Delight"", ""Loss Of Control"", ""Could This Be Magic?"" & ""In A Simple Rhyme"" ooze with a primal intensity, fueled by Roth's theatrical bravado and Eddie Van Halen's increasingly experimental guitar work. The album is less about polished pop and more about the band's ferocious stage presence, translated into a studio masterpiece. While other albums may have greater commercial appeal, Women and Children First captures the raw, unapologetic spirit that made Van Halen a force to be reckoned with, solidifying its place as the quintessential Roth-era release.",2025-04-02 17:28:28,music,music,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,12,17,,0.77,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1jpuej8/women_and_children_first_is_the_best_david_lee/,NewPatron-St

1k754s9,reddit,One line….“SILENCE”,"I need helps finding a song from the 80/90's era...it has kind of the techno beat.  They sing one word ""SILENCE""...sounding more like a demand.  I do not remember any other words in the song.  But this particular line is ringing loud and clear in my memories.

Any help identifying this song would be greatly appreciated.",2025-04-24 22:20:37,music,music,entertainment,Entertainment,[],0,9,9,,0.71,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1k754s9/one_linesilence/,hurricane70
