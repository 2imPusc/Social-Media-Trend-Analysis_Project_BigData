gaming,1jpucx4,ml8xbrv,"People on Reddit don’t want to hear this, but games are one of the few consumer goods that have gotten cheaper over time when you adjust for inflation.

People should reject monetization schemes they don’t like by not paying for them, but they should also consider that these are often implemented because of gamers’ outrage at price hikes that are fairly normal in other industries. For the industry to survive, players are going to have to accept price hikes or accept that games will continue to try to get them to spend after they buy the game. We as gamers can’t have it both ways, and for much of the industry to survive, gamers are going to have to accept price hikes.

And Jobst barely mentioned the real reason in videos since the lawsuit was brought forward.  His GoFund me page to fund his defense didn't even mention the real reason.

Karl claimed Billy's successful lawsuit against Apollo is what led Apollo to suicide.  Specifically, the financial burden placed upon Apollo.

Except there wasn't one.  Not to the extent Jobst claimed.  Jobst apologized in a video......to his viewers......on a Dark Souls video.....during the last five minutes.....of a thirty minute long video.

Jobst is absolutely in the wrong here.  He begged for money for his lawsuit under false pretenses, made a half hearted apology to the wrong people, and continued to put out anti-Billy content when he really should have clammed up entirely.

I dislike Billy a lot.  I think he's an egotistical narcissist with a superiority complex.  He'll probably try suing me just for saying that.  Even the judge said Billy's history makes him look less than favorable.  But Jobst is just as bad in this situation.  He lied by omission to his viewers on what the court case was actually about and took their money under the pretense that it was Big Bad Billy coming down with his ""I didn't cheat"" hammer once again.

It's disappointing because...yea...now the Billy supporters can and will use this as ammunition against the proof that Billy did, in fact, cheat tremendously throughout his career.",983,2025-04-01 13:23:33,ERedfieldh

I read a lot of stories about sony being a PITA reverting this and outside of them not having business hours on the weekend, I was able to resolve it OK, just took some time.

First I called the support number 8003457669. After giving them my serial number, they looked it up and told me about the report and said I needed to connect with direct support.

You can do that here: https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/contact-us/direct/?category=PS+Direct

Their chat system is still open today so you might have some luck. Their system SUCKS though and I got disconnected a couple times while chatting. Once I told them what happened, how support directed me to them, etc, they escalated the issue.

I received an email within a day telling me they were looking into it, and I think within 24hrs from then, it was resolved.

This should absolutely not have happened, obviously, but glad my new pro did not stay perma-bricked.

Now they're launching the Switch 2 with Elden Ring, that's fine but the likes of the Steam Deck mean it's not new or exciting anymore. The Switch sold itself on not just Nintendo games, but it being the only option for big games on a handheld.

Atleast as Naoe, enemies can spot you more easily when you're hiding in bushes in winter because the foliage is dead, but they seem to be worse at hearing you move thanks to the snow and frozen lakes and rivers can give you another avenue for engaging, or act as a hazard.

Same seems to go for Autumn where its raining more often so you're harder to spot but the puddles make you louder.

gaming,1jo7swh,mktcntn,"Yep. Night and day, different weather, and different seasons all come with a whole host of different kinds of stealth and traversal pluses and minuses. 

Besides all the big stuff already mentioned, a couple things I noticed: during the heavy part of winter, the dense forests are slightly easier to get through because a lot of the foliage is thinner. So during the winter you can more easily traverse those big thick forest for short cuts across the terrain. The downside is that all the foliage is thinned out so there's not as many places to hide. The farmers actually take down their crops during that time of the year so those big fields of tall grass are gone. 

In deep snow, you can't run at fast speed! Not good if you get busted in the middle of a base and try to hightail it. 

Pretty much every logical game mechanic change you can imagine happens with the weather and nighttime and season changes.

It's a really brilliant mechanic and i'm surprised no one's talking about it more. I want more open world games to have this. A fantastic way to keep the game always shaken up a little.",7,2025-04-01 05:59:42,yotothyo

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild's Nintendo Switch 2 edition doesn't come with the Expansion Pass, meaning you'll have to pay an additional $20 to play the DLC on the new system if you don't already own it.

The upgrade pack will honor the DLC if you already have it, otherwise you’ll have to pay an extra $20 for the Switch 2 BotW DLC.",25,2025-04-11 12:12:07,nampezdel

gaming,1jtpxeq,mlwkek2,"Seeing a lot of weird takes on this. 

Balance patches and updates have been a thing in fighting games for decades at this point. Before DLC, devs would roll out multiple balance patches and changes to their arcade versions. The console release of games were often later builds with the most recent balancing and rosters. This often led to drastically different console versions or entirely new builds being re-released. Some of the most well known are Super Street Fighter 2 and Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection. The only thing that's changed is now devs can do this on the fly. This isn't the first time a balance patch has been negatively received and certainly won't be the last.

The issue with this particular update is that Tekken 8 already had significant changes to gameplay which made it very different from previous versions and this update took things even further. Many players feel it's too far from what Tekken used to be now.

Which I feel is understandable, if you spent years playing a game, mastering it's mechanics and suddenly someone came along and completely changed the rules and forced you to play with them you'd probably be a little frustrated also. 

I appreciate that Namco wanted to make Tekken more flashy and more interesting to watch but they've kind of turned it into a Shonen Jump fighting game. Every match has turned into a race towards who can mash out the flashiest moves possible. It makes my ADHD go crazy because I just don't even know where to look or how to react anymore.",117,2025-04-07 18:26:27,AlamosX

There seems to be an information gap between kids who grew up with the 80s/90s consoles and PC's, and the so-called ipad kids and the older generations who picked it up a little bit later in their lives.

Before advancements that made using tech much, much more intuitive, people used to need a bit more savvy. What you got out of it was proportionate, in a way, to what you put into it. So a willingness to learn and putting in effort were both requirements of use. It feels like it was the last generation that had real boredom. Led to a greater technological literacy 

Then there's also the connectivity factor. The behaviors learned were before in-game and micro purchases were even a reality. As well as the lack of easy access to the time suck that social media can be.

gaming,1jrs931,mlh7atp,"Hyperoptimisation of "" the first playthrough""  is what ruins this.  
That's the mistake many people do in these games is to immediately disregard the main story and jump right into doing every sidequests , minigames , collectables and do deep dives into microlevels of min-maxxing into whatever the game has to offer first. That's why it gets so repetitive. They do this, are stuck playing a low level character for hours, barely find new loot that's useful due to not leveling up and probably fight the same hordes of enemies for hours too. Stop that! Go do the main story in bigger chunks instead of getting lost in side activities after doing 1 mission or so. 

Don't be afraid to not get a 100% on your first playthrough. If you liked the game enough, you will have a better time with character #2 when you know a lot more about the game.

What killed Kinect was trying to make it a required peripheral for the Xbox One resulting in the console being $100 more expensive than the PS4.

First, it's important to compete on price. Second, even though it had improved from the first generation, the Kinect 2 didn't work well enough to carry the console - you needed a large room and the tracking could be really unreliable, and the voice commands would be triggered at the wrong time while not hearing you when you wanted it to. Last, Xbox had an established fan base that wanted core traditional gaming experiences.

The older gamers here, myself included have tons of great memories playing this game with friends growing up. But honestly I couldn't care less for a remaster or remake of this game. It was really important for its time and pushed gaming forward, but It isn't exactly something we need to revisit over and over. They already tried to remake it and it failed, the audience for it is like mid-30s or older gamers who fondly remember playing the N64. Which is a niche target to aim for.

The more you explore in the game the more you will appreciate the exploration, world building, story and everything present in it and then it just clicks and you're sucked in totally.

gaming,1jo7l8c,mkpmrc0,"Honest to god I don’t know why Jagex keeps trying to make new games. Look at their track record and how many times they’ve flopped a title. They have one recognizable game where they lucked into a formula that nestles in the sweet spot of casual and requiring a bit of tism to enjoy. And they nearly destroyed that game too. They had to find an old save of the game and reboot that to save their company basically.

I don’t think there’s any game studio as notable as Jagex with as much (video game) blood on their hands. They are a barely competent development studio who can’t go two months without tripping over themselves and pissing off their players.

Excited to see if they finally overcome their losing streak, but I certainly won’t be the testing dummy who buys into this within the first month or so. And I say that as someone who has played runescape for nearly 2/3rds of their lifespan (on and off of course).

So while I don’t wish ill on Jagex here, every buyer has the right to know just how stupid the company is they might be buying from.


Edit: another fun fact about Jagex, their account security is so abysmal, that for over 15 years, if you had any capitalization in your passwords, it didn’t even matter.

gaming,1jmcj0i,mkasord,"League of Legends has a roster of 170 characters and their fighting game will only launch with 10. Having all 170 would be insanely stupid but I'm shocked they're shipping with only 10 fucking characters, especially when this game is supposed to be a 2v2 fighting game.",1340,2025-03-29 03:00:44,AaronBasedGodgers

gaming,1jmcj0i,mkb6tcy,"They have had this roster of characters forever it feels like. The optimist in me wants to think they have a lot more hidden away that they may be able to start pukping out at games launch but i dunno, maybe they were hit hard with layoffs that we dont know about too? Really weird though 10 is so small that people will get uninterested very easily if their favorite character isnt there.",80,2025-03-29 04:45:13,Booplee
gaming,1jmcj0i,mkaqlhz,Riot can’t do more than 10 characters at launch and some people still think the Riot MMO will actually happen lmao,490,2025-03-29 02:46:54,shottymaid
gaming,1jmcj0i,mkcecf6,That's very disappointing for a 2v2 game with almost a decade in development for arguably one of the biggest gaming IPs ever,17,2025-03-29 12:11:08,Long-Combination-375

gaming,1jmcj0i,mkb0y05,Dead on arrival? A 2v2 tag team fighter with only 10 characters on launch sounds like a player retention nightmare. You don’t make a splash into a heavily saturated genre like that.,137,2025-03-29 03:59:08,bad_timing_bro
